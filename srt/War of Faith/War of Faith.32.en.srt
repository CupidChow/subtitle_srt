00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,870
Sir.

3
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,070
The ferry is leaving.

4
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,150
Would you like to take a rest inside?

5
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,840
Dad!

6
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,750
Dad!

7
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,710
Dad!

8
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,590
Dad!

9
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,240
Yu!

10
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
Yu!

11
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,470
Dad!

12
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,280
Yu!

13
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,800
Dad's coming!

14
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,590
Excuse me.

15
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,630
Dad, I'm here. Dad.

16
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,360
Yu!

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,630
Dad!

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,240
Dad!

19
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,070
Why are you here?

20
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,670
Mom said you're going on a business trip again.

21
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,240
We didn't want to leave you.

22
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,520
Otherwise, I'll wake up crying every day.

23
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,190
We had a deal.

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,190
Wherever you go, the family stays together.

25
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,800
Home is

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
wherever you are.

27
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,320
Are you not going to get our suitcases?

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,590
You've pledged your life to the country,

29
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,190
so I'll pledge my life to you.

30
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,870
You won't let the country down,

31
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,530
so I won't let you down either.

32
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,870
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,590
Let's go.

34
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,280
Mr. Kang, you want to see me?

35
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,310
Shen Tunan ran away with his family.

36
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,840
When did that happen?

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
This morning.

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,000
No one stopped him?

39
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,730
Could it be that

40
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,190
he took his whole family to join the Communist Party?

41
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,520
Two days ago, the aide-de-camp of the chairman of the Standing Committee

42
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,470
came to find him.

43
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,870
No one knows what they talked about.

44
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,390
But Shen Tunan is likely to be entrusted with important duties

45
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,680
by Nanjing.

46
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,070
Hello.

47
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,510
Director He?

48
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,800
Yes, it’s me.

49
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,480
What can I do for you?

50
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,870
Yes.

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,630
He is doing well,

52
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,010
and is pretty capable.

53
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,680
Well,

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,480
there's no inconvenience.

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,090
I'll send him there right away.

56
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,360
Don't worry.

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,390
Mr. Kang.

58
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,320
What happened again?

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,450
What's wrong, Mr. Kang?

60
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,190
You've been to Nanjing?

61
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,190
What for?

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,390
I just received a notice to send you to Jiangxi to fight against the Communist Party.

63
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,120
Really?

64
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,160
You seem very willing to go.

65
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,560
It would be best if I could go.

66
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
Jiangxi is the frontline of fighting against the Communists.

67
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,390
It's easy to establish merit.

68
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,560
It'll be good for my career too.

69
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,120
The Communist Party has turned Jiangxi upside down.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,240
If you go there now,

71
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,490
are you sure you can come back?

72
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,920
For Kuomintang,

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,310
I, Qiaosong, am willing to spare no effort until the day I die.

74
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,830
So you already knew

75
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,240
about this arrangement.

76
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,380
Wouldn't it be nice to make a fortune with us?

77
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,560
Mr. Kang, let me be honest with you.

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,360
Even if you were to give me a mountain of gold,

79
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,600
it doesn't feel as good as catching a communist

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
with my own hands.

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,390
Alright.

82
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,630
Go if you want.

83
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,240
When you arrive in Jiangxi,

84
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
be sure to make your contributions.

85
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,560
Maybe one day,

86
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,620
we'll meet again on the battlefield.

87
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,240
Go on.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Mr. Kang, I want to take Wenbiao with me.

89
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,630
No.

90
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,750
He's an idiot.

91
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,390
He will cause you trouble.

92
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,270
I'll be watching out for him,

93
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,870
whether or not he is a fool or if he causes trouble.

94
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,830
It's none of your business.

95
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,630
Mr. Kang.

96
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,510
Lin Qiaosong.

97
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,240
What do you take me for?

98
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,360
Mr. Kang.

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,600
I just want to do something for Kuomintang.

100
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,630
If you have any instructions for this trip to Jiangxi,

101
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,960
I, Qiaosong, will do my best to cooperate.

102
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,510
Mr. Kang!

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,630
Get up.

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,090
You two shall go over first,

105
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,510
and scout around.

106
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,830
Get lost.

107
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,800
Mr. Kang.

108
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,830
Take care.

109
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,680
Hello.

110
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,830
Mr. Yu?

111
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,070
Yes, it's me.

112
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,830
Something happened to Shen Tunan.

113
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,510
I'm worried that

114
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,560
he will come back one day.

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
You two have fun.

116
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,640
Lin Qiaosong.

117
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,670
Lin Qiaosong!

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,060
What are you doing?

119
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,510
Nothing.

120
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,000
I was just passing by,

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,510
and thought I would come see you.

122
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,240
I will go back after seeing you.

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,280
What's wrong?

124
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,530
Did something happen?

125
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,750
Don't think too much.

126
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,790
Go back.

127
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,330
Are you leaving Shanghai?

128
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,200
How did you know?

129
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,670
A friend saw you

130
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,800
buying a suitcase at Xinshi Department Store.

131
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm going to Jiangxi to suppress the Communist Party.

132
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,740
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

133
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,940
Buy one more ferry ticket.

134
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,210
I'll go too.

135
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,270
No, you can't.

136
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,080
Cut the crap.

137
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,870
If you don't agree,

138
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,840
I'll call Nanjing

139
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,050
and report you for selling opium.

140
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm going to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists.

141
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm not going there for a holiday.

142
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,910
Going to Jiangxi?

143
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,840
It's more likely than not you will die.

144
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,040
I don't want to not be there when you die.

145
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,640
Lin Qiaosong.

146
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
You dream on.

147
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,600
Even if you die,

148
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,220
you can't get rid of me.

149
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,100
I owe it to you in my previous life.

150
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,670
Hello, comrade.

151
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,120
Hello.

152
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,270
Good morning, comrade.

153
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,080
Morning.

154
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,720
Good morning.

155
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,520
Good morning.

156
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,250
Hello, comrade.

157
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,410
Comrade Ruolai.

158
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,600
Chief Lei is looking for you.

159
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,270
Okay.

160
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,550
Sir.

161
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,630
Come in.

162
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,400
Chief Lei, you wanted to see me?

163
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,510
Ruolai.

164
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,790
Your letter of appointment has been approved.

165
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,920
The president appointed you himself.

166
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,630
You'll be the deputy chief of the General Affairs Unit,

167
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,960
helping me with my work.

168
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,270
Yes.

169
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,480
We'll work together from now on.

170
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,150
Okay.

171
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,790
One more thing.

172
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,690
It's unfortunate.

173
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,510
I'm Wei Ruolai, Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Unit,

174
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,870
from the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank.

175
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,750
Can you call Instructor Shen for me?

176
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,550
Hold on.

177
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,120
Ruolai.

178
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,390
Instructor Shen.

179
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,320
You're back.

180
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,320
Yes, I've started work at the bank now.

181
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,320
Have you made up your mind?

182
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,150
Yes.

183
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,550
The foundation of finance is credibility.

184
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,670
The Communist Party has great credibility in Jiangxi.

185
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,870
It's very promising.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,390
That's great.

187
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,790
I'm glad that you have the confidence.

188
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm happy for you.

189
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
What's wrong?

190
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,320
Anything else?

191
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,120
Just say it.

192
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,270
Don't be a wuss.

193
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,910
Chief Lei gave it to me.

194
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,870
Take a look.

195
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,390
It's okay.

196
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,870
I've got it.

197
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,360
Thank you.

198
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,890
You're the only sister

199
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,750
I have in this world.

200
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,750
I choose to believe you,

201
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,800
and I want to believe in you.

202
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,490
Thank you, Brother.

203
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,910
Brother.

204
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,600
Brother.

205
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,480
No matter where you are,

206
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,120
I'll always be your sister.

207
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,640
Ruolai,

208
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,960
do you want to take me as your mentor?

209
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,290
I was born by my parents,

210
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,359
but I am taught by my mentor.

211
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,750
Mentor Shen,

212
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,310
please accept three bows from me, Ruolai.

213
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,970
I will do my best in the future,

214
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,660
and I will not let you down.

215
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,850
We've reached, Yu.

216
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,790
Nanchang Field Headquarters' Suppression Army.

217
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,350
Special Commissioner Tu, welcome to Ganzhou.

218
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,000
Hello.

219
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,660
Take their suitcases.

220
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,400
Mom.

221
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,590
Dad, how long are we going to stay in Ganzhou?

222
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,590
Ganzhou has a lot of mountains and a great view.

223
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,130
We could be here for a long time, okay?

224
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,350
Master, Madam, Miss, hello.

225
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,790
Dazhuang, Erzhuang, take their suitcases.

226
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,640
Xiaoju, Xiaofeng, go make tea.

227
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,880
We're here.

228
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,070
Slow down.

229
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,370
There are so many lotus flowers here.

230
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,750
Slow down, Miss.

231
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,400
Slow down, Yu.

232
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,750
Miss, slow down.

233
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,200
It's so big.

234
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,200
This place is nothing compared to Shanghai.

235
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,590
I'm sorry to make you go through this.

236
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,270
No, I think this place is nice.

237
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,790
It looks like the house I lived in when I was a kid.

238
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,070
Really?

239
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,920
Mom.

240
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,480
Mom, come and take a look!

241
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,230
Coming.

242
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,160
Sir.

243
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,680
Sir.

244
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,000
Sir.

245
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
What's wrong?

246
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,520
I overheard them saying in the car that

247
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,510
Lin Qiaosong is coming to Jiangxi too.

248
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,680
He seems to have been parachuted in.

249
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,080
He'll be here in two days.

250
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,080
It seems that Nanjing still doesn't trust me.

251
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,160
They sent someone with a grudge to keep an eye on me.

252
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,420
What should we do, Sir?

253
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,690
The armed forces in Ganzhou

254
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,240
is under the control of

255
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,110
the Brigade Commander of Guangdong Army, Qian Fengshi.

256
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,000
Chen Jitang of the Guangdong Army does not listen to the chairman of the Standing Committee.

257
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,240
Therefore, Qian Fengshi will also not listen to me.

258
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,900
Now that Lin Qiaosong is here,

259
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,110
it's not that we can't work together,

260
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,040
but that we will just use each other for our own needs.

261
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,040
A bustling, cosmopolitan city,

262
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,880
a place of fireworks,

263
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,750
where the elites gather.

264
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,700
The Shanghai Bund.

265
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,270
Brother,

266
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,790
why do we have to go to Jiangxi?

267
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,480
We have to go even if we don't want to.

268
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,940
I can go anywhere with you.

269
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,240
Really?

270
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,640
Well,

271
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,830
I still don't quite understand.

272
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,880
We were doing fine in Shanghai.

273
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,960
We had status,

274
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,560
and we were making big money.

275
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,270
Why do you have to go to Jiangxi,

276
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,750
and put your life on the line to fight the Communists?

277
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,880
I was right when I said you were a moron.

278
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,750
How long do you think we can sell opium for?

279
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,720
If something happens, they will be protected.

280
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,640
But for us,

281
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,680
we will die.

282
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,400
Let's just talk about the recent construction treasury bill.

283
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,730
Those from the banks who were close to them

284
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,930
were also ripped off and lost their family fortune.

285
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,570
Some even lost their family members.

286
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,790
Oh yeah.

287
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
So do you still want to sell opium?

288
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,310
This time, you can be rest assured.

289
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,160
My position

290
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,680
is Captain of the Ganzhou Detachment,

291
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,510
from the Nanchang Field Headquarters' Suppression Army, Ranger Formation.

292
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,550
Our mission

293
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,030
is to collect information about the Communists.

294
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,400
We can arrest anyone we deem suspicious during the course of operation,

295
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,550
and we'll cooperate with the regular army to fight against the communists.

296
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,950
How many guns and how many people do we have?

297
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,070
Director He means we should fully cooperate with

298
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,000
Special Commissioner's strategy of staging an economic siege.

299
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,790
So...

300
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,200
if the Ganzhou Detachment's Ranger Formation has any battle losses,

301
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,590
we'll fill in for them anytime.

302
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,320
We've got guns and ammunition.

303
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,030
All that you can think of.

304
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,160
This is a good thing.

305
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,240
But

306
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,040
Jiangxi is the base of the Communist Party.

307
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,160
It's not enough to just have guns.

308
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,860
I have a spy in the Jiangxi Soviet.

309
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,880
Now that we're in Jiangxi,

310
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,960
the mansion is still so extravagant.

311
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,420
Sir, please have some tea.

312
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,070
Mr. Shen will be here in a moment.

313
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,720
Okay.

314
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,830
Captain of the Ganzhou Detachment, from the Nanchang Field Headquarters,

315
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,070
Suppression Army's Ranger Formation, Lin Qiaosong,

316
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,070
reporting to you.

317
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,920
Have a sit.

318
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,550
Yes.

319
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,110
Long time no see.

320
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,160
Long time no see.

321
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,110
What kind of destiny is it that

322
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,030
we can meet again in Ganzhou,

323
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,960
thousands of miles away?

324
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,830
Well, I took the initiative

325
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,160
and asked my superiors

326
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,640
for this destiny.

327
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,440
It's not easy.

328
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,000
It's my honor

329
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,310
to work with you, Mr. Shen.

330
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,240
Shen Tunan

331
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,790
no longer exists.

332
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
My surname is Tu now.

333
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,860
I’m from Tu Nanshen from Xiangxi.

334
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,230
Sorry, my oversight.

335
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,310
Before I left,

336
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,920
Director He specifically told me

337
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,960
to keep this secret for you.

338
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,070
But don't worry, Special Commissioner Tu.

339
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,750
Only the higher-ups know about this.

340
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,400
Good.

341
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Well Captain Lin,

342
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,550
what's next?

343
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Are you going to keep your eyes on me

344
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,640
or do something useful for the party and the country?

345
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,770
Is there a conflict?

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,880
No.

347
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,550
I'll tell you the truth.

348
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,270
Next,

349
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,200
I plan to take down

350
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
the gentries in Ganzhou.

351
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,110
You must cooperate with me.

352
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,960
As long as it’s beneficial to Kuomintang,

353
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,020
I'm always at your disposal, Special Commissioner Tu.

354
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,460
Well, that's what I've been waiting for.

355
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,860
Please come in.

356
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,070
A small gift.

357
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,350
Please come in.

358
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
This way, please.

359
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,070
Watch the steps.

360
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,480
Please come in.

361
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,680
Everyone, this way please.

362
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Please come on in.

363
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,590
Please come in and have some tea.

364
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,120
Sir will be here in a moment.

365
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,130
Please come in.

366
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,380
Special Commissioner Tu, they're all here.

367
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,830
How many of us here?

368
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,720
Let's start.

369
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,640
By the way, Brigade Commander Qian,

370
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,680
are you familiar with our new Special Commissioner?

371
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,590
Everyone.

372
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,590
Thank you for coming. I'm late.

373
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,070
Please forgive me.

374
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,640
Have a seat.

375
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,350
Special Commissioner, you are indeed a very important envoy.

376
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,640
I'm Qian Fengshi.

377
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,310
Please take care of me.

378
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,790
Brigade Commander Qian, don't say that.

379
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,110
I’m also new here.

380
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,480
I'll need your support

381
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,510
in the future.

382
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,640
Same to you.

383
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,110
I'm relieved to hear that.

384
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,000
Let me introduce someone to you.

385
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,480
Captain Lin.

386
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,240
Here.

387
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,270
Captain Lin Qiaosong of the Ganzhou Detachment,

388
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,330
from Nanchang Field Headquarters, Ranger Formation.

389
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
Welcome.

390
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,510
Welcome, Captain Lin.

391
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,720
Today,

392
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,200
Captain Lin specially prepared

393
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,310
three gifts for all of you.

394
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,110
This is the first gift.

395
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,000
You're too kind.

396
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,830
Look carefully.

397
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,510
This is 6 months' worth of records

398
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,750
of the various merchants who smuggled contraband goods into Jiangxi Soviet,

399
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,550
and those who had also bought tungsten ore from them,

400
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,550
and then resold it

401
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,310
to others.

402
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,350
According to Article 9 of the Sanctions on the Communist-controlled Areas,

403
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,880
those who violate the rules

404
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,310
will be executed.

405
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,840
Special Commissioner.

406
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,670
The people who are here today

407
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,160
are the top figures of Ganzhou.

408
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,270
They are sincerely here to welcome you.

409
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,400
It's inappropriate

410
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
to do this.

411
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,280
Brigade Commander Qian, are you sure about this?

412
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,830
Let me make it clear.

413
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,200
This business

414
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,790
isn't even mine.

415
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,200
It's Commander Chen's business in Guangdong.

416
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,260
You can choose to not give me respect,

417
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,160
but are you going to also

418
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,680
disrespect Commander Chen?

419
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,000
Brigade Commander Qian.

420
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,590
It's our Nanchang Suppression Army Ranger Formation who will be taking action.

421
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,030
We only follow orders from Nanchang Field Headquarters' Director He.

422
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,070
You can go to Director He if you have any opinion.

423
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,680
If Commander Chen has any opinion,

424
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,280
he can also go to Director He.

425
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,400
These two people had significant amounts of business with the Communist Party.

426
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,750
They are unforgivable.

427
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,110
Fine.

428
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,030
Nice kill.

429
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,680
Special Commissioner.

430
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,720
That's one way to clean up the Guangdong Army.

431
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,830
Why did Cui Yunge,

432
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,030
of all businesses,

433
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,140
choose to collude with the Communist Party?

434
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,510
He deserved to be killed.

435
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,000
Brigade Commander Qian, you indeed understand the great righteousness of Kuomintang.

436
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,160
It's the party and the state's fortune.

437
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,000
It's my duty.

438
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,550
Second gift

439
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,680
is a handwritten order from the chairman.

440
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,790
I, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government,

441
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,000
Chiang Zhongzheng,

442
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,680
appoints Tu Nanshen,

443
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,200
as the Special Commissioner of Southern Jiangxi Economic Embargo Division,

444
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,400
to supervise

445
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,350
the important task of executing an economic siege on the Communist-controlled areas in southern Jiangxi.

446
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,160
If necessary,

447
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,110
you can mobilize the Ranger Formation,

448
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,970
as well as local military forces.

449
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,110
We must make sure no rice or water reaches our enemy,

450
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,550
and that there will be no one left to inform us.

451
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,350
The economic siege

452
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,270
is critical in our military campaign against the city.

453
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,590
Eliminating tungsten ore trade is utmost critical.

454
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,110
Local governments and businesses must work closely together.

455
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,550
Offenders will be severely punished.

456
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,160
Sit.

457
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,920
Sit.

458
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,270
Everyone, listen carefully.

459
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,680
Now that I've taken over the task of launching an economic siege,

460
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,750
I won't accept any more collusion of any kind

461
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,960
with the Communist Party.

462
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,880
Our rangers

463
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,020
will be monitoring your transactions in real time.

464
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,350
If anyone dares to go against the rules,

465
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,030
especially when it comes to tungsten ore,

466
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,680
your outcome

467
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,960
will be the same

468
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,910
as those two who got dragged out.

469
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,920
So,

470
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,720
decide whether you want your life,

471
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
or you want your fortune.

472
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,880
I won't do it again.

473
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,720
Don't worry, Special Commissioner.

474
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,790
We will never do business with the Communist Party again.

475
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,240
Yes.

476
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,400
Yes, Special Commissioner.

477
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,680
We won't dare to anymore.

478
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,720
We really won't.

479
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,480
We won't do it ever again.

480
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,210
Never again.

481
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,280
Captain Lin.

482
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,080
The third gift, please.

483
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,750
The waterways of southern Jiangxi are well-connected,

484
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,200
with countless merchant ships passing through.

485
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,790
This also facilitates smuggling.

486
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,960
So, setting up checkpoints,

487
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,360
and guard towers on land is far from enough.

488
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,350
Next,

489
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,350
I plan to set up checkpoints in the important waterways,

490
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,480
and recruit an anti-smuggling squad,

491
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,030
to check

492
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,720
incoming and outgoing merchant ships round the clock.

493
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,120
All of these initiatives

494
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,590
requires money.

495
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,350
Everyone here

496
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,480
have made a lot of money

497
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,510
from your tungsten ore businesses.

498
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,750
Because tungsten ore has been so profitable,

499
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,480
I will require

500
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,260
all of you to support us

501
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,160
in our upcoming endeavors.

502
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,620
The donation forms are right in front of you.

503
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,200
You are free to donate as much as you want.

504
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,330
Just write a number.

505
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,510
We should all donate!

506
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,200
Special Commissioner,

507
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,350
I'll donate 10,000 silver dollars first.

508
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,400
5,000 from me.

509
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,720
I'll... donate 8,000.

510
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,070
Special Commissioner, I'll donate 5,000.

511
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,200
Okay.

512
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,590
Someone in the Southern Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce colluded with the Communists.

513
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,070
I'm responsible for my own negligence.

514
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,920
I will

515
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,240
donate 30,000 silver dollars.

516
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,000
30,000?

517
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,250
Thank you for your support, Brigade Commander Qian. Thank you.

518
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,510
Have some tea.

519
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,920
Recently, the lockdown of the Free China area

520
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,050
is suddenly much tighter than before.

521
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,550
Here,

522
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,790
here,

523
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,070
and here.

524
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,680
Several open trade routes

525
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
have been cut off.

526
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,240
The key is Sanjiang Kou.

527
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,000
Then, are there any problems with our

528
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
maritime trade line?

529
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,790
Not yet.

530
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,640
Sanjiang Kou is Ganzhou's gateway to the Jiangxi Soviet.

531
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,030
70% of our salt

532
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,310
comes in from here,

533
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,960
and most of the tungsten ore are also shipped out from here.

534
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,550
If Sanjiang Kou gets stuck again,

535
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,240
then...

536
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,460
the consequences will be unimaginable.

537
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,480
According to the original plan,

538
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,640
the salt we imported from the Guangdong army

539
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,500
will arrive at San Jiangkou soon.

540
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,480
You'll sneak into Ganzhou and escort them.

541
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,590
Make sure the salt passes Sanjiang Kou smoothly.

542
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,050
Yes, I'll get the job done.

543
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,720
Various counties in southeastern Jiangxi

544
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,030
still continue to smuggle goods to Communist-controlled areas.

545
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,400
Most of the cloth was smuggled from Le'an,

546
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,080
foreign oil was smuggled from Nanfeng,

547
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,750
and salt was smuggled from Maodian, Ganxian District.

548
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,880
Meanwhile, Ganzhou has the widest variety of goods.

549
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,640
Salt, foreign oil, cloth,

550
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,480
and other supplies have all been previously smuggled.

551
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,610
Sanjiang Kou is a strategic location.

552
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,860
They're all profit-seekers.

553
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,540
They'll risk their lives for profit.

554
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,880
Looks like we didn't kill enough people before.

555
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,070
We didn't set the rules clearly enough for them.

556
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,680
The economy of the Communist-controlled areas

557
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,480
is like a fetus' umbilical cord.

558
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,510
It provides a steady flow

559
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,370
of nutrients to their base areas.

560
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,360
If we don't severe the cord,

561
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,090
we can't destroy them completely.

562
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,720
So the most important thing

563
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,650
is to cut their umbilical cord.

564
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,920
Yes.

565
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,700
To severe the cord.

566
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,680
Operation Cord Severance

567
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,000
is to completely cut off the economic activities of the Communist-controlled areas.

568
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,790
Then,

569
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,750
what we need to do

570
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,720
is to destroy the reputation of the Communist Party,

571
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,550
and let every banknote they make

572
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,510
be completely reduced to waste paper.

573
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,840
Special Commissioner.

574
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,480
I've found him.

575
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,310
I picked him out of the prison's death row.

576
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,030
He's a master of ammunition.

577
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,270
His name is Yang Liuzhi.

578
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,070
Bring him in.

579
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,830
Let him in.

580
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,030
I'm Yang Liuzhi. I've been in the ammunition trade since young.

581
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,720
My skills are nothing out of the ordinary.

582
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,980
I just make a living in the martial world.

583
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,940
I'd like to ask for your

584
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,320
kind support in the future.

585
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,510
As long as your skills are good enough,

586
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,640
we'll have many opportunities to work together.

587
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,400
Yes.

588
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,370
Camp Commander Liu.

589
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,200
You've got all the paperwork.

590
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,830
Let's go.

591
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,310
Okay.

592
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,550
Wait.

593
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,160
Camp Commander Liu.

594
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,230
Captain Lin.

595
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,510
Which unit of the Guangdong Army is this brother from?

596
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,480
He is...

597
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,030
Sir,

598
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,590
escorting military supplies is a covert operation.

599
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,920
You have no right to ask.

600
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,639
Military supplies?

601
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,699
Let's check it.

602
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,130
Captain Lin,

603
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,070
These are all military supplies of the Guangdong army.

604
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,960
Camp Commander Liu,

605
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,480
since the headquarters sent us here

606
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,110
to help you manage Sanjiang Kou,

607
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,320
we can't just keep going through the motions.

608
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,840
Since it's the supplies of the Guangdong Army,

609
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,110
it would be able to stand up to the scrutiny.

610
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,550
Let us go through the procedures,

611
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,550
so that we can explain to the higher-ups.

612
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,070
Wenbiao.

613
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,510
Yes.

614
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,570
Let's proceed.

615
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,840
Please.

616
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,760
Camp Commander Liu.

617
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,590
Although we are just going through routine checks,

618
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,190
you should

619
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,320
also avoid arousing suspicion.

620
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,550
These are the military supplies of the Guangdong Army after all,

621
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,150
ain't it?

622
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,670
Ally,

623
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,330
long time no see.

624
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,330
Why are you in Jiangxi?

625
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,800
To wipe out the Communist Party.

626
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,630
How is my sister?

627
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,760
That depends on you.

628
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,630
I know.

629
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,400
When I sent you to the Communist-controlled areas as an undercover,

630
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,000
you held a grudge against me.

631
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,560
I stand in front of you today.

632
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,730
You can punch me to vent your anger.

633
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,670
I dare not.

634
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm willing to do this

635
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,550
to save my sister.

636
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,280
That's good.

637
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,800
We already have a plan.

638
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,570
The communists

639
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,170
won't last for two days.

640
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,710
When can I see my sister?

641
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,370
Not until you've finished your mission with us.

642
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,040
Your sister embroidered this herself.

643
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,480
Keep it as a memento.

644
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,880
Also,

645
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,180
your sister is not young anymore.

646
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,670
Work hard,

647
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,890
and save some dowry for her.

648
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,710
Let's go.

649
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,840
Brother.

650
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,480
Brother.

651
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,550
Brother!

652
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,190
No!

653
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,000
Meijuan.

654
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,590
No!

655
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,400
Meijuan?

656
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,960
Did you have a nightmare again?

657
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,520
I dreamt that my brother

658
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,470
was arrested by the Communists.

659
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,000
They were about to shoot him.

660
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,720
A simple pass is all you need

661
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,500
to pass through Sanjiang Kou?

662
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,480
It seems that they have been secretly colluding with the Communist Party

663
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,670
for a long time now.

664
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,510
Special Commissioner.

665
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,510
Should we start with teaching the Guangdong Army a lesson?

666
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,170
Let's not fall out with Commander Chen just yet.

667
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,510
Let's find a chance to break off one of his finger

668
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,360
as a reminder.

669
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,670
Yes.

670
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,920
Also,

671
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,670
is everything going well with Yang Liuzhi?

672
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,510
We should be seeing results very soon.

673
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,360
Operation Cord Severance

674
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,480
is officially initiated.

675
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,110
Yes.

676
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,930
Where are the goods?

677
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,560
They emptied the goods.

678
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,630
Where is the money?

679
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,480
The money is gone.

680
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,630
Useless!

681
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,730
They aren't just a ranger team.

682
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,450
They are a bunch of robbers.

683
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,000
He has messed up the shipping lines in Ganzhou.

684
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,630
It will be difficult to trade tungsten ore

685
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,840
in the future.

686
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,440
Send someone to Nanjing

687
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,670
and find out exactly who is backing up Tu Nanshen

688
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,670
and Lin Qiaosong.

689
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,030
I want to find out their entire background

690
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,560
and who's supporting them.

691
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,590
Deputy Chief Wei,

692
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
I feel like

693
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,550
there's never enough silver dollars in the bank these days.

694
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,320
Some people want to exchange our new banknotes

695
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
for silver dollars as soon as they get them.

696
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,480
It’s normal.

697
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,800
The new currency is meant to be pegged to the silver coins.

698
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,150
That's the only way you can establish trust

699
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,350
in your new currency.

700
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,280
But...

701
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,880
But this is the third time this week

702
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,070
that I've received a large exchange order.

703
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,800
Look.

704
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,670
Go get me this week's ledger.

705
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,280
Okay.

706
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,080
This is the general ledger.

707
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,630
Let's go.

708
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,630
Let's take a look at the counters.

709
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,320
Okay.

710
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,060
Show me the money you received today.

711
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,360
Fake notes! These are all counterfeit notes!

712
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,280
Fake notes?

713
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,360
We want to exchange silver dollars!

714
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,880
Listen to me.

715
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,920
Just one sentence.

716
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,760
Folks!

717
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,000
Folks!

718
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,880
Listen to me!

719
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,070
Folks,

720
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,400
listen to me.

721
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,920
Of course we have silver coins.

722
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,480
However, it's not that we don't want to do the exchange.

723
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,110
We just received a notice from the headquarters,

724
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,960
saying there's something wrong with this lot of coins.

725
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,550
There's a problem?

726
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,680
What's the problem?

727
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,360
It's pretty much the same at all the branches.

728
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,230
The people are frantically demanding to exchange

729
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,280
their counterfeit notes for silver coins.

730
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,940
Some even asked to exchange for gold and silver.

731
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,770
Something is going to happen.

732
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Listen to me! Listen to me!

733
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,230
I'm the deputy chief of the General Affairs Unit, at the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank.

734
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,590
I'm Wei Ruolai.

735
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,030
Kuomintang did make a batch of counterfeit notes,

736
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,070
and it has found its way into the Jiangxi Soviet.

737
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,730
Fake notes?

738
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,000
I know you are all very anxious.

739
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,400
We are also very anxious.

740
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,260
Let me give you an example.

741
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,670
We're waiting for the rice to cook on the stove,

742
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,070
but the main room is on fire.

743
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,550
Should we put out the fire first,

744
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,960
or should we remove the rice from the stove first?

745
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,880
Put out the fire.

746
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,800
Put out the fire!

747
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,400
Put out the fire first.

748
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Yes,

749
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,070
it's only after we put out the fire,

750
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,800
that we can cook with a peace of mind.

751
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,710
We can continue to save or cash out.

752
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,400
It's business as usual.

753
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,630
So in the meantime,

754
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,670
please make sure to register yourselves.

755
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,400
We will solve the problem of counterfeit notes as soon as possible.

756
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,480
If you suffer losses,

757
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,000
you can go to the headquarters to get even with me, Wei Ruolai.

758
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
You can flip desks, or even carry a hoe and bury me alive.

759
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,230
Let's listen to him.

760
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,830
Why don't we register first?

761
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,030
We believe you.

762
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,630
Thank you, Deputy Chief Wei.

763
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,110
Folks, folks.

764
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,230
Let's line up,

765
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,830
and go in to register with me.

766
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,510
Line up, line up!

767
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,400
Study hard.

768
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,230
Be good.

769
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,760
Slow down, Yu.

770
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,920
Xiaoyun! Xiaoyun!

771
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,360
Hi Yu!

772
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,230
Dad,

773
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,960
remember to pick me up tonight.

774
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,530
Don't ever play with her again.

775
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,550
Yu, Yu?

776
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,510
What's wrong?

777
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,070
Xiaoyun won't play with me.

778
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,920
It’s okay.

779
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Give her and your other classmates the cookies,

780
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,070
and she'll play with you.

781
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,110
Got it.

782
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,070
Goodbye, Yu.

783
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,880
Bye.

784
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,920
Sir, it's time to go.

785
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,420
It looks very real.

786
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,420
It's colour

787
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,400
and texture,

788
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,280
are the same as real notes.

789
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,550
Even Lenin's beard looks very real.

790
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,630
It looks like the work of a top artist.

791
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,150
How could you tell it's a counterfeit note?

792
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,840
The texture of the printed paper is different.

793
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,510
These counterfeit notes feel delicate and smooth.

794
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,070
But the factories in Jiangxi Soviet

795
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,800
do not have enough of such banknote paper.

796
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,280
We have to make paper the old-fashioned way.

797
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,210
So, the texture will feel rougher.

798
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,830
It must be Kuomintang this time.

799
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,710
No one else has the equipment

800
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,110
or the technology to do so.

801
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,670
They're mounting a currency war with Jiangxi Soviet.

802
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,880
They're using counterfeit notes

803
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,630
to disrupt the financial order in Jiangxi Soviet,

804
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,230
in order to trigger inflation,

805
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,840
and deal a blow to the credibility of the Soviet currency.

806
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,590
In the end, it will result in an outflow of gold and silver from Jiangxi Soviet,

807
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,590
and cause our economy to breakdown.

808
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,070
It sounds like a tough battle.

809
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,230
Are you confident?

810
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,510
I have to.

811
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,070
If only Mr. Shen was here.

812
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,960
If he were here,

813
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,160
you'll be more troubled.

814
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,550
I'd rather have him here,

815
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,920
and have the headache instead.
