00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,940
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,550
Mr. Kang,

5
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,600
are you sure you're talking about my sister, Shen Jinzhen?

6
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,070
You should know Jinzhen.

7
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,700
She's spoiled and protected.

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,850
Her hands are only for playing piano.

9
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,080
Plus, she grew up with me.

10
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,960
I swear

11
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,720
she's never had a chance to join the Communist Party.

12
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,190
I have Li Shengda.

13
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,259
He can testify anytime.

14
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,030
A traitor of the Communist Party

15
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,590
is slandering a core member

16
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,800
of the arsenal in order to delay

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,509
the grand siege against the communists in Jiangxi.

18
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,310
If this delays the production of the gunpowder,

19
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,100
Mr. Kang,

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,280
you

21
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,150
would be an accomplice.

22
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,490
Advisor Shen,

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,370
you are truly a politician.

24
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,550
Your accusation of me is precise and harsh.

25
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,810
If you don’t accept it,

26
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,180
bring Li Shengda out

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,400
and I’ll confront him.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,740
He is an important witness.

29
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,340
You should avoid suspicion.

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,270
On my way here,

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,290
I saw that the Garrison Command

32
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,520
is quite empty.

33
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,780
Did your driver also go out on a search?

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,950
Li Shengda

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,510
didn't escape, did he,

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,340
Mr. Kang?

37
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
Also,

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,350
are your gold bars from the Central Bank

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,829
in his hands too?

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,550
There's no witness,

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,540
so let's end this farce here.

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Mr. Kang,

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,690
he's just a communist traitor

44
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,520
attacking people like a rabid dog

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,280
in order to cheat you and live.

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,760
Do you really believe him?

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,940
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

48
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,730
Chairman Chiang ordered

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,040
that when dealing with communists,

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,440
we should rather mistakenly kill 3,000 than let a real one go.

51
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,650
Are you questioning Chairman Chiang?

52
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,450
You're wrong.

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,360
I firmly support Chairman Chiang,

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,220
but let me tell you,

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,540
Shen Jinzhen is my sister.

56
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,650
My sister

57
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,640
is my bottom line.

58
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,470
Whoever crosses that line

59
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,540
will be my sworn enemy.

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,190
I haven't checked

61
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,710
all of the Investigation and Arrest Unit's accounts

62
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,040
in the Central Bank for what it should or shouldn't have,

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,170
but maybe,

64
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,000
it'll appear on the major newspapers tomorrow.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
By then, Chairman Chiang

66
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
and the people

67
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,670
can take a good look

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,280
at how you people secretly

69
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,640
feather your own nest.

70
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,550
Shen Tunan,

71
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,280
are you threatening me?

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,370
It's not a threat.

73
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,930
It's the last notice.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,270
You're doing this to perform a meritorious deed.

75
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,270
I'm doing this to protect my family.

76
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,920
At worst, I'll make you die with me.

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,350
I'll fight to the end.

78
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,820
We have different standpoints and work for different things,

79
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,670
but I've interrogated countless communists.

80
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,470
I can say with my whole chest

81
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,230
that Shen Jinzhen is a communist.

82
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,590
I can even shoot her

83
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,300
just based on my suspicion.

84
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,280
It's just a matter of writing a few reports.

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,370
Kang Shaojie!

86
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,610
You can try.

87
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,100
If anything happens to Jinzhen,

88
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,730
I'm telling you, this will be our personal grudge

89
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,240
and I won't stop until you're dead.

90
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,709
I'd like to see if the person behind Mr. Yu

91
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,130
can save your life or not.

92
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,350
Jinzhen.

93
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,130
Tunan.

94
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,900
What took you so long?

95
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,780
Let's go home.

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,690
Let's go.

97
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,600
Kneel.

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,080
Jinzhen,

99
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,940
do you know what our father

100
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,470
was proudest of in his life?

101
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,980
He followed the former president, Mr. Sun Yatsen,

102
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,210
to build the Longhai Railway and the Guangzhou–Hankou railway.

103
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,920
Wrong.

104
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,990
The thing he was proudest of

105
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,030
was that he built and protected

106
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,590
a happy family.

107
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,430
When he passed away,

108
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,780
he wrote in his will for me,

109
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,020
"The elder brother is like a father.

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,630
Tunan,

111
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,160
take good care of Jinzhen."

112
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,850
From then on, I swore

113
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,220
to take good care of you and protect you,

114
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,900
to make your life

115
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,880
happy and safe.

116
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,030
Tunan,

117
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,930
-why are you—
-Let me finish.

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,480
If anyone wants to hurt you

119
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,930
when you haven't done anything wrong,

120
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,260
I can fight him to the end,

121
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,260
but this time, I couldn't be direct.

122
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,590
I want you to face our parents' memorial tablets

123
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,659
and face me, your brother,

124
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,860
and tell me the truth.

125
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,670
Are you...

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,160
A communist?

127
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,140
What do you mean?

128
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,590
Even you don't trust me?

129
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,230
Can't you tell?

130
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,470
It's the same as last time.

131
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,550
Wei Ruolai and I

132
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,040
are their pawns to harm you.

133
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,770
Do you know who Kang Shaojie is?

134
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,940
How many communists

135
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,990
has he arrested and interrogated?

136
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,170
If he says you are, then you are.

137
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,960
Since you believe him,

138
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,360
why did you bring me back?

139
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,370
If you think I'm a burden,

140
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,050
we can cut ties now.

141
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,950
Stop talking nonsense.

142
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,150
I want to protect you.

143
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,860
I'll just say one thing.

144
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,880
They claimed that I killed Li Shengda last year

145
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,130
on December 27th,

146
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,790
but you personally took me home

147
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,560
after I worked overtime at the arsenal.

148
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,140
They said I assassinated Li Shengda at the hospital.

149
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,100
There were so many people

150
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,770
from the Investigation and Arrest Unit outside the hospital room.

151
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,820
How could I get in?

152
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,100
Can I fly?

153
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,660
Tunan,

154
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,340
you are anxious

155
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
about the new policy.

156
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,290
I understand.

157
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,910
You've contributed a lot all these years

158
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,690
for our family.

159
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,990
I'm grateful too.

160
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,460
But our parents passed away early

161
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,620
and you brought me up.

162
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,500
You should know

163
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,860
what kind of person I am.

164
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,040
I never thought

165
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,540
that one day,

166
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,700
you would ask me

167
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,799
in front of our parents like this.

168
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,260
I never thought you'd distrust me like this.

169
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,350
I'm just...

170
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,170
I'm just worried about you.

171
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,100
I can tell you

172
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,390
that my only identity

173
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,610
is Shen Tunan's sister.

174
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,160
Dad,

175
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,760
Mom,

176
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,240
Mr. Kang,

178
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,180
please hurry up this time.

179
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,670
I have to go out to keep searching.

180
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,110
For what?

181
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,120
It’s been such a long time.

182
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,920
Li Shengda

183
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,390
is probably in Hong Kong already.

184
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,060
Mr. Kang,

185
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,280
it wasn't my men who guarded Li Shengda.

186
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
How dare you talk back?

187
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,020
And who do you work for?

188
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,060
I'm sure

189
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,840
Shen Jinzhen is a communist.

190
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,630
Why did you let her go?

191
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
You think I wanted to?

192
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,450
The case couldn't proceed

193
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,730
without a witness.

194
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,180
How could I explain

195
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,040
if Shen Tunan reported it to Nanjing?

196
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,300
But she's a communist.

197
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,300
A communist!

198
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,470
If you don't dare to take the responsibility,

199
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,200
I'll take it.

200
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,400
Mr. Kang,

201
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,050
before she runs away,

202
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,070
I can arrest her and personally interrogate her.

203
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,070
Okay.

204
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,710
If you have such ambition,

205
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,540
go to Jiangxi.

206
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,480
There are many communists there.

207
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
Kill as many as you want.

208
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,210
Stop hanging around in front of me.

209
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,160
I get annoyed whenever I see you.

210
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,660
Mr. Kang.

211
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,260
Get lost!

212
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,790
Now!

213
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,090
Mr. Kang.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,630
Dad,

215
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,830
guess who I drew.

216
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,650
Let me guess.

217
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,550
Judging from the clothes,

218
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,140
it should be your silly aunt,

219
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,730
right?

220
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,250
Jinzhen.

221
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,730
Sister-in-law.

222
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,780
Send this up to them.

223
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,870
Yu needs vitamin supplements.

224
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,860
Give Tunan a way out.

225
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,210
Why did you say she's silly?

226
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,010
Do you want to hear it?

227
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,010
Yes.

228
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,400
Okay.

229
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
I'll tell you.

230
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,070
Your aunt

231
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,800
was very smart when she was young.

232
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,660
She learned everything very fast.

233
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,340
I

234
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,360
didn't really like your aunt when I was young.

235
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
Why not?

236
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,880
Because your aunt

237
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,150
made me seem dumb.

238
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,000
But she does have a problem.

239
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,790
She's straightforward

240
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,330
She's very direct when speaking.

241
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,910
Sometimes when she encountered someone

242
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,210
who did something wrong,

243
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,000
she would go up and argue with them

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,490
about who's right and who's wrong,

245
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,850
but this isn't necessary.

246
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,310
Sometimes when we encounter difficulties,

247
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,270
we need to step back

248
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,030
and maybe the problem will be solved.

249
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,960
Otherwise, you'll suffer losses.

250
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
That's why I said your aunt is silly.

251
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
What should we do?

252
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,630
People might get annoyed at her.

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,930
I have

254
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
thought about it.

255
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,440
I wanted your aunt to change

256
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,880
so she could suffer less,

257
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,880
but then I thought that if she changed,

258
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,770
she wouldn't be herself anymore.

259
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,780
It's the best

260
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,060
to be yourself.

261
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,900
It's more genuine.

262
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,860
Even if she causes a lot of problems for me,

263
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,530
I'll just help her take care of them.

264
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,730
I'm willing to take care of her forever.

265
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,720
But you have to remember

266
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,700
that we can learn from your aunt's strengths.

267
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,550
She's smart, upright, brave,

268
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,100
and kind.

269
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,290
But let's not copy

270
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,020
her weaknesses, like how she sometimes

271
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,070
is too opinionated

272
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,140
or talks too harshly.

273
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,440
Sometimes, she is stubborn

274
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,870
and offends others.

275
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,120
She charges forward even if she's at a disadvantage.

276
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,790
Let's not learn these things from her.

277
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,420
I got it.

278
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,300
You got it?

279
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,590
You just finished drawing a silly aunt.

280
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,580
Now let's start to draw Mom,

281
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,140
okay?

282
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,070
Is this a qipao?

283
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,750
Yes.

284
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,740
Mom is very tall.

285
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,370
Make the qipao longer.

286
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,210
[Shanghai Garrison Command]

287
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,280
Sir,

288
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,800
it's not your fault.

289
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,840
Why did Mr. Kang suspend you?

290
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,710
A girl like Shen Jinzhen

291
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,800
lacks nothing

292
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,420
and has a comfortable life.

293
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,210
How could she join the Communist Party?

294
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,250
Is she that bored?

295
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,040
No.

296
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,350
No.

297
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,090
Throughout history, rebels rarely come from

298
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,220
the families of nobles and officials.

299
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,500
So, what's with her?

300
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,620
What's with her?

301
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
You were...

302
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,730
Is this important?

303
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,490
Yes.

304
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,880
The more you know someone,

305
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,960
the easier it is to find their weakness.

306
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,070
It seems

307
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,390
that it's time

308
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,430
for me to delve into her family

309
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,870
and her past.

310
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,660
Do you like it?

311
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,720
Why haven't I

312
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,490
seen this dress before?

313
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,410
When you were arrested,

314
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,920
I had the tailor make it.

315
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,070
It's the latest design from Paris.

316
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,490
Thank you.

317
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,410
Sister-in-law,

318
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,650
weren't you afraid

319
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
that I wouldn't be released?

320
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,070
I was afraid,

321
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,830
but I believed

322
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,090
you wouldn't do anything

323
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,160
to harm your brother or the family.

324
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,210
If you really are a communist,

325
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,980
just let us know.

326
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,620
We can all go to Moscow.

327
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,810
At least

328
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,230
we can still survive there.

329
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,730
Sister-in-law,

330
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,790
what are you thinking about?

331
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,310
If I were a communist,

332
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,490
I wouldn't have been released so easily.

333
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,330
Besides,

334
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,820
with my temper,

335
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,870
they would've killed me

336
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,530
not long after I got arrested.

337
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,830
You're right.

338
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,640
With your temper,

339
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,140
you can tolerate anything

340
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,380
but losses

341
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,710
and hardships.

342
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,540
Put it on

343
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,510
and raise your head high.

344
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,860
In the future,

345
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,390
no one will dare to bully us.

346
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,040
Mr. Weng.

347
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,800
Mr. Weng,

348
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,030
you're finally here.

349
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,690
Miss Shen has been urging me

350
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,440
and asking where you were.

351
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,960
Please come in.

352
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,210
Mr. Li, please come in.

353
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,250
Please enjoy.

354
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,310
Reporter Tian, you’re finally here.

355
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,510
You’re finally here.

356
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,230
Welcome.

357
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,080
It would be great if you could

358
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,350
take some photos of Miss Shen tonight

359
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,220
and write some praises in the newspaper tomorrow.

360
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,660
Mr. Kang.

361
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,410
What are you doing here?

362
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,440
I also received an invitation.

363
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,580
Mr. Shen said I must come.

364
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,730
Be careful with your words and actions.

365
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,560
Mr. Kang, you're here.

366
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,660
Mr. Xu,

367
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,980
-Welcome.
-Hello.

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,920
Welcome, Mr. Xu.

369
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,480
Please come in, Mr. Xu.

370
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,710
Sir,

371
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,790
it's already on the newspaper.

372
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,420
Good.

373
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,090
Mr. Weng of the arsenal

374
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,920
and Reporter Tian from the newspaper have arrived too.

375
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,090
This time, we'll definitely

376
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,570
help Miss Shen restore her reputation.

377
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,450
Definitely.

378
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,250
But...

379
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,130
What?

380
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,270
Kang Shaojie

381
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,820
and Lin Qiaosong are also here.

382
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,680
I invited them.

383
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,830
Restoring Jinzhen's reputation

384
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,780
is like a slap to the Garrison Command's face.

385
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,880
If they didn’t come,

386
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,600
look.

387
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,590
This grand event would turn into a one-man show.

388
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,200
They look

389
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,090
quite disgusting.

390
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,210
I know you hate them.

391
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,250
Sometimes,

392
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
they're not clean

393
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,000
in the way they act,

394
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,790
but you must remember

395
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,840
that they are also working for the Kuomintang.

396
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,830
Without them,

397
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,380
the communist activities will only be more rampant.

398
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,580
Compared to finance,

399
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,780
the struggle of faith and mentality

400
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,530
is actually more complicated.

401
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,000
You must be careful.

402
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Yes, sir.

403
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,580
Mr. Kang,

404
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,890
a few days ago, Commander Xue from the front line called.

405
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,630
He urged the arsenal

406
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,780
to make over 1,000 cases of shells.

407
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,660
I told him we couldn't do it.

408
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,830
Not only was the equipment broken,

409
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,590
but my precious engineer

410
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,430
was also arrested by you.

411
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,490
Commander Xue yelled my head off.

412
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,990
He said if you didn't release her,

413
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,150
he would have his men

414
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,760
aim the shells at your face.

415
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,280
I know Commander Xue.

416
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,640
He loves joking around.

417
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,000
Mr. Weng, what did you say?

418
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,150
I stopped him, of course.

419
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,720
I told him

420
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,520
that Mr. Kang

421
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,430
is the wizard of the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

422
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,750
Yes.

423
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,120
He'll definitely give Engineer Shen justice.

424
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,850
And how is it?

425
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,350
Miss Shen is fine.

426
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,500
This time, it was

427
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,270
the Investigation and Arrest Unit's mistake.

428
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,800
I'll drink as a punishment.

429
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,800
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

430
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,350
Don’t be upset, Captain Lin.

431
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,410
You lost this time,

432
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,810
but keep going next time.

433
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,920
You won't finish catching all the communists any time soon.

434
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,690
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,180
It's your duty. I understand.

436
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,350
But this time,

437
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,060
Chief Kang suspended you

438
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,740
to shirk the responsibility.

439
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,830
I don't think that's very fair of him.

440
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,940
No, no.

441
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,500
I'm also responsible.

442
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,570
Don't be discouraged.

443
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,340
You are capable

444
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,670
and you want to serve the country.

445
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,470
In the future,

446
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,690
there'll be a place for you to shine.

447
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,470
Thank you.

448
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,620
Everyone is here.

449
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,420
Would you like to say something?

450
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,820
What should I say?

451
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,350
Say whatever you want.

452
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,270
Okay.

453
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,480
First,

454
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,970
thank you for coming to the Shen Residence tonight.

455
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,000
Here,

456
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,760
I want to thank my brother,

457
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,470
my family,

458
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,310
and my friends.

459
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,420
Without you,

460
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,610
I don't know

461
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,960
where I'd be now.

462
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,820
The one I must thank the most

463
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,510
is Mr. Kang.

464
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,000
Mr. Kang

465
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,580
is indeed a big shot in Shanghai.

466
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,920
As long as he wants,

467
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,840
anyone can be arrested,

468
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,400
anyone can be investigated for no reason,

469
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,860
and anyone can be beaten until they confess.

470
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,790
Of course,

471
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,220
anyone

472
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,610
can also be innocent.

473
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,610
I'm very grateful to Mr. Kang

474
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,470
for giving me justice.

475
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,600
If it weren't for you,

476
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,290
I might not even

477
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,070
still be here right now.

478
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,550
Of course,

479
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,040
then there wouldn't be

480
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,860
such a beautiful party tonight.

481
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,930
It's all in the past.

482
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,360
I wish you all

483
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,680
a pleasant night.

484
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,050
Great!

485
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,430
Well said.

486
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,780
So, Miss Shen Jinzhen,

487
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,560
may I have a dance?

488
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,700
My pleasure.

489
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,100
Don't step on my foot.

490
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,630
I won't.

491
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,590
Tunan,

492
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,080
thank you for this.

493
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,990
Recovering your reputation

494
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,790
is necessary for both you and me.

495
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,890
That's not what I'm thanking you for.

496
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,130
I'm thanking you

497
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,650
for trusting me.

498
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,680
Who said I trust you?

499
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,870
I'm kidding.

500
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,030
I know you well.

501
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,180
You're a spoiled girl

502
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,810
and can't even cook a bowl of noodles.

503
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,170
How can you bear the hardships of the Communist Party?

504
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,230
More importantly,

505
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
you're right.

506
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,820
You're my only sister

507
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,710
in this world.

508
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,620
I choose to trust you,

509
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,980
and I'm willing to trust you.

510
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,490
Thank you.

511
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
Thank you, Tunan.

512
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,530
Go upstairs.

513
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,280
Take a rest.

514
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,630
Chief Deng, Mr. Weng.

515
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:31,800
Tunan.

516
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,710
Jinzhen's problem is solved.

517
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,840
It's so satisfying.

518
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,650
Yes, I finally let go of my heart.

519
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,560
Mr. Weng,

520
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,750
this must have

521
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,170
caused you a lot of trouble.

522
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,400
As Jinzhen's brother,

523
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,210
I apologize to you on her behalf.

524
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,040
From now on,

525
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,830
you have to take good care of her as usual.

526
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,000
Don't worry.

527
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,580
She's the treasure of the arsenal.

528
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,720
Sorry for the trouble.

529
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,320
She's everyone's treasure.

530
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,470
Come on.

531
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,720
Thank you too.

532
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,010
You spoke well.

533
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,250
Thank you.

534
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,400
What happened to your hand?

535
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,390
I scraped it when doing chores at home.

536
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,370
What kind of chores can do this to you?

537
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,530
It's not a big deal.

538
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,130
It's okay.

539
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,640
My brother told me

540
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,650
that you stalked Li Shengda before.

541
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes.

542
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,990
He had a gun,

543
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,580
so I stopped after I followed him

544
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,490
to the hotel.

545
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,930
Mr. Shen also told me to be careful.

546
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,330
Then,

547
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,070
was it also your suggestion

548
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,500
to hold this cocktail party tonight?

549
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,910
Since we've cleared the suspicion,

550
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,310
we have to make it public.

551
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,830
Otherwise, it will affect Mr. Shen.

552
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,960
You're very thoughtful.

553
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,010
You killed two birds with one stone.

554
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,210
Then why are you so sure

555
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,390
-that Li Shengda won't come back?
-Don't worry.

556
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,310
He won't.

557
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,520
Can I interpret it as

558
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,390
Li Shengda

559
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,400
will never be able to come back?

560
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,640
The favor you owed me before

561
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,310
has been cleared.

562
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,500
Miss Shen.

563
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,110
What's wrong?

564
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,900
Miss Shen,

565
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,130
I don't care what your identity is, but I hope

566
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,100
you can think twice before acting in the future.

567
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,570
What do you mean?

568
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,550
In the past, I followed my brother

569
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,890
and the people who interacted with him.

570
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,430
Their temperaments were similar to yours,

571
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,690
especially your eyes.

572
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,100
When the drivers went on strike,

573
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,630
your sympathy towards them

574
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,570
and your anger towards the police

575
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,280
were enough to show your political tendencies.

576
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
This is just your personal opinion.

577
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,850
And when you talked about my brother

578
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,920
at the Western restaurant last time,

579
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,520
the look in your eyes couldn't deceive anyone.

580
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,190
Don't worry.

581
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,490
I will keep this secret in the bottom of my heart.

582
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,560
But I still hope

583
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,940
you can be more careful.

584
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,200
Don't burden Mr. Shen anymore.

585
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,020
Open the door.

586
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,360
Lin Qiaosong, I know you're home.

587
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,390
Open the door!

588
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,380
I'll smash it if you don't open it.

589
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,040
Are you opening it or not?

590
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,970
What do you want?

591
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,190
They said you're suspended.

592
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,490
That's perfect.

593
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,930
You're free now.

594
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,880
We can put our matter on the agenda.

595
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,990
Don't look at me like that.

596
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,980
That's right.

597
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,910
You're stuck with me.

598
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,880
Lin Qiaosong,

599
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,070
it's okay if you lost your job.

600
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,710
I have money.

601
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,790
I can support you.

602
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,760
I'll support you no matter what you want to do.

603
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,690
Tell me.

604
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,200
How much do you want?

605
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,740
Don't be so upset.

606
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,040
This is Shanghai.

607
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,200
As long as you're smart and ruthless enough,

608
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,060
you can become successful anytime.

609
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,040
You are a top student from Huangpu.

610
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,300
I bet you can

611
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,670
do better than fruit sellers

612
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,430
or rural peasants.

613
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,110
Wake up!

614

Without my gun

615

and that uniform,

616
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,280
I can't protect you like I used to.

617
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,690
I'm no longer

618
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,510
the mighty Lin Qiaosong.

619
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,300
You are!

620
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,150
Lin Qiaosong,

621
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,120
it doesn't matter that you lost your job.

622
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,640
What I don't want is for you

623
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,440
to lose your pride and ambition.

624
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,560
Pride?

625
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,910
Ambition?

626
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,000
I've never had it before.

627
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,710
I've never had it before.

628
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,380
Stop pitying yourself.

629
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,000
Lin Qiaosong,

630
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,150
show me your confidence

631
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,810
from when you flirted with me.

632
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,640
I don't have much patience.

633
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,280
If you can't do it,

634
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,240
I...

635
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,700
I'll walk in front of you with another man

636
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,660
every day.

637
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,490
-I have ways to make you suffer.
-How dare you!

How dare you!

639
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,560
See if I dare.

641
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,110
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

643
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,700
I'm sorry.

00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,360
I'm sorry.

[Central Bank Shen Tunan's sister Shen Jinzhen stuns the crowd at the banquet]

The Garrison Command is humiliated.

649
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,460
This is too high-profile.

650
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,469
As an underground party member,

651
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,710
your face shouldn't be exposed.

652
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,110
This will add more danger

653
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,900
to your future missions.

654
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,920
This was my brother's idea.

655
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,170
He made me the focus of the media

656
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,030
to intimidate those people.

657
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,030
I’m worried about Li Shengda.

658
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,639
Li Shengda has been eliminated.

659
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,580
You acted on your own again.

660
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,800
It wasn't me.

661
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,690
Who was it then?

662
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,790
Wei Ruolai.

663
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:54,900
Hello, sir.

664
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,739
Hello.

665
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,910
I need to deposit something.

666
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,310
Okay, wait a moment.

667
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,830
Please sign your name

668
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,770
here and here.

669
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,810
This is your key and deposit certificate.

670
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,970
Please keep it safe.

[Hong Fang Clothing Shop]

672
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,180
I found out after the fact.

673
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,350
Did he tell you the specific method he used?

674
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,360
No.

675
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,680
But judging from the wound on his hand,

676
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,780
Wei Ruolai strangled him with a rope.

677
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,760
Did he bury the body?

678
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,420
Probably.

679
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,920
What do you mean?

680
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
If you don't ask about these things,

681
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,160
what will you do if something goes wrong?

682
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,360
He suffered a lot because of Li Shengda.

683
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,170
I believe

684
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,140
he wrapped things up cleanly.

685
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,240
You believe?

686
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,940
He's just a kid.

687
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,170
He's in his twenties.

688
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,640
He's not a kid anymore.

689
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,120
He looks young on the surface,

690
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,350
but his mind is clear.

691
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,210
He even guessed my identity.

692
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,850
You...

693
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,510
You're not thinking of killing him to silence him, right?

694
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,890
Of course not.

695
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,810
He's the family of a martyr.

696
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,280
Also,

697
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,140
he likes you.

698
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,420
When you danced with your brother at the banquet,

699
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
I saw that he was watching secretly.

700
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,680
There was

701
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,140
admiration, curiosity,

702
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,800
and worry in his eyes.

703
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,360
Worry?

704
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,390
Probably because of your identity.

705
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,080
He's afraid something might happen to you again.

706
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,610
He's worried my issue will affect my brother.

707
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,000
Don't worry.

708
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,950
He will keep it a secret for me.

709
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,330
If anything happens to me, my brother will be implicated.

Why not?

00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,730
I think

720
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,950
you should give it a try.

721
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,850
He's a promising man.

722
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,670
He's talented and has a special identity.

723
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,370
Most importantly,

724
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,250
the party needs talents like him.

725
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,610
You mean

726
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,480
his financial talent?

727
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,290
Although Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang

728
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,950
launched a second siege on us,

729
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,910
not only was the base in southern Jiangxi

730
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,480
and western Fujian not defeated,

731
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,830
but it even expanded.

732
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,830
Donggu Civilian Bank has expanded to form

733
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,740
the Southwest Jiangxi Industrial and Agricultural Bank.

734
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,860
Plus, the Jiangxi Soviet government

735
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,800
established the Jiangxi Workers & Farmers Bank in Ji'an

736
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,110
and the Western Fujian Soviet

737
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,160
established the Western Fujian Industrial and Agricultural Bank in Longyan.

738
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,440
The financial system our party built

739
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,260
has braved the waters

740
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,780
and set sail.

741
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,030
I really want to take a look

742
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,570
and personally experience

743
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,830
the atmosphere and vitality of the base.

744
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,830
There will be a chance.

745
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,370
There will be more and more similar banks in the future,

746
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,890
but we have a serious lack

747
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,280
of financial talents.

748
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,320
So,

749
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,930
the organization wants us

750
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,390
to develop a group of financial talents in Shanghai

751
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,720
to go to Jiangxi Soviet.

752
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,030
The first one I thought of

753
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,220
after getting the mission

754
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,410
was Wei Ruolai.

755
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,860
Since the organization needs it,

756
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
I can give it a try,

757
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,210
but...

758

I think location is important,

802
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,370
but talent is more important.

803

I think the communists

are still in the hands of the Communist Party.

825
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,360

that the Jiangxi Workers & Farmers Bank's credit is stabilizing.

the Communist Party

It's data,

855
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,610
They're even laughably small,

856
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,730
