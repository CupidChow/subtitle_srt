00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,770
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,630
The informant refused

5
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,390
the gold bars I offered.

6
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,870
He said

7
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,030
he'd try to get them himself.

8
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,330
So I guess he wants to

9
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,680
embezzle the gold bars.

10
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,310
But most of all,

11
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,190
he'll come to my house tonight to get the stuff.

12
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,240
What are you doing?

13
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,210
Leave me alone.

14
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,620
L-Let go!

15
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,480
Are you crazy?

16
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,160
Take the gold bars and flee.

17
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,830
Nowadays...

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,330
Let go.

19
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,110
With money,

20
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,690
you can live happily anywhere.

21
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,440
Let go!

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,310
Are you crazy?

23
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,680
Wei.

24
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,050
Trust me, Wei.

25
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:19,780
I'll kill him for you.

26
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,340
Flee with the gold bars.

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,110
No.

28
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,370
Just give me your shoes before you leave.

29
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,820
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,480
Do you think the Investigation and Arrest Unit is useless?

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,810
I'm being targeted now.

32
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,829
They're waiting for me

33
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,890
to dig my own grave.

34
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,190
Have I been exposed?

35
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,680
It can't be.

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,810
I didn't leave anything traces

37
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,310
for him to see through me.

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,490
The gold bars were my brother's last wish.

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,260
I must fulfill it.

40
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,150
I must get it to the real handler.

41
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,350
They are communists.

42
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,210
Shush.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,850
Why ruin your bright future at the Central Bank

44
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,510
by getting involved with hem?

45
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,100
Or you can turn yourself in.

46
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,240
Hand the gold bars to the Investigation and Arrest Unit

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,800
and it'll reflect remorse.

48
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,020
I don't think

49
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,550
they'd punish you.

50
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,310
No.

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,770
That's my brother's last wish.

52
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,329
Your brother's gone.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,470
At most,

54
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,990
he'll just scold you

55
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,850
in your dreams.

56
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,800
Wei.

57
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,360
We are just commoners.

58
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,910
Kuomintang and Communist Party's conflict

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,250
has nothing to do with us.

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,840
Right?

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,370
Listen to me.

62
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,410
Give them the gold bars.

63
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,470
Don't keep them with you.

64
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,920
They're trouble.

65
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,990
Wei, I beg you.

66
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,570
Okay?

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,120
Got it.

68
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,820
Got it.

69
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,480
Don't talk

70
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,019
and don't look back.

71
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,480
Close the door.

72
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,110
This is an emergency.

73
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,170
I'll make it short.

74
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,420
Your brother

75
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,330
Wei Ruochuan

76
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,530
is an underground party member.

77
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,610
I'm his comrade

78
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,230
and handler.

79
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,930
What handler?

80
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,320
What do you mean?

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,909
The previous handler has betrayed us.

82
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,830
I don't understand a word

83
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,630
you're saying.

84
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,810
The exchange rate is weird today.

85
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,170
Do you want yellow or green goods?

86
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,650
It should be fine.

87
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,150
Ruolai!

88
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,670
What took you so long?

89
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,880
I've been waiting for ages.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,950
Sorry to keep you waiting, Shengda.

91
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,510
I've been busy.

92
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,960
Where is it?

93
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,320
The key.

94
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,030
Okay.

95
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,300
The seal.

96
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,060
Okay.

97
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,090
Shengda.

98
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,170
From now on,

99
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,880
I have nothing to do with you.

100
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,330
Don't come to me again.

101
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,990
Great.

102
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,510
With these gold bars,

103
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,040
our comrades will be saved.

104
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,570
There's still hope for the revolution.

105
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,990
You should leave now.

106
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,000
Go out, turn right, and go south.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Wade through a small river.

108
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,420
No one will see you.

109
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,780
Okay.

110
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,730
Great.

111
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Ruolai.

112
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,460
Give me a hug.

113
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,380
Take care, Ruolai.

114
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,870
Bye.

115
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,940
The exchange rate is weird today.

116
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,080
Do you want yellow or green goods?

117
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:49,870
Don't move.

118
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,090
If you're my brother's comrade,

119
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,510
you wouldn't hurt me, would you?

120
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,430
Of course not.

121
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,850
You're a martyr's brother.

122
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,620
That's good.

123
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,710
If there's nothing else,

124
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,790
I'll go home.

125
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,720
Don't follow me.

126
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,360
Or I'll scream for help.

127
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,190
I don't need your trust.

128
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,860
I want you to do something for me.

129
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,390
What is it?

130
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,390
Give the safe's key and seal

131
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,600
to the traitor.

132
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,900
Why?

133
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm not sure

134
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,990
how much the Investigation and Arrest Unit knows,

135
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,790
or if they

136
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,100
set up an ambush in Central Bank.

137
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,350
So,

138
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,430
let the traitor get the gold bars himself

139
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,430
and follow him.

140
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,130
If he really embezzles them,

141
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,810
I'll find a chance to assassinate him

142
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,810
and get them back.

143
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,500
Your brother died

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,620
because of a traitor's betrayal.

145
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,409
So...

146
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,890
Why don't you kill him now?

147
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,630
I can't.

148
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,770
We need the gold bars to save other comrades' lives.

149
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,780
I promise you in the name of the organization

150
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,500
we'll avenge your brother.

151
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,400
Please cooperate with us.

152
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,570
Brother.

153
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,350
If you're in heaven,

154
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,540
please bless them to succeed.

155
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,700
If they fail,

156
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,110
I'll do it myself.

157
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,680
Even if I have to go through fire and water,

158
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,540
I'll avenge you.

159
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,310
Do you think Li Shengda

160
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,220
can join the Investigation and Arrest Unit?

161
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,980
No.

162
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,570
He'll never be rid of

163
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,190
his identity as a communist.

164
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,700
The captain was only polite to him

165
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
to use him to arrest communists.

166
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,850
Once this matter is over,

167
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,250
it won't end well for him.

168
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,030
Something's off.

169
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,320
What?

170
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,100
We've been watching him all morning,

171
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,430
but we haven't seen him.

172
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,860
He can skip meals,

173
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,850
but he'll need to use the toilet.

174
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,480
Sir.

175
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,500
Sir.

176
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,190
What’s wrong?

177
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,660
Lee Shengda is missing.

178
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,000
What?

179
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,340
The bookstore clerk said

180
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,430
he went out early in the morning.

181
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,290
But they don't know where he went.

182
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,410
When did he come back last night?

183
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,390
Past midnight...

184
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,470
around 4 a.m.

185
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,780
He looked very excited.

186
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,180
So,

187
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,810
he has taken

188
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,350
something important from Wei Ruolai's place.

189
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,750
What could it be?

190
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,430
If it's a name list

191
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,350
or plan...

192
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,430
But he has betrayed them.

193
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,590
There's no need

194
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,060
to hide these things.

195
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,120
To make him change his mind

196
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,130
and act behind our back...

197
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,170
It must be important.

198
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,830
Valuable

199
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,740
and easy to cash in.

200
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,430
Opium?

201
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,920
No.

202
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,950
Gold bars?

203
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,780
It's possible.

204
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,270
Inform all stations

205
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,300
and shipping companies

206
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,210
to check the tickets.

207
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,870
I think Li Shengda is fleeing.

208
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,110
Also,

209
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,390
investigate the bookstore and interrogate the clerks.

210
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,470
Don't miss

211
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,390
any trace.

212
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,290
I'll go myself.

213
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,410
Da Li, Er Hu,

214
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,570
follow me.

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,190
Yes.

216
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,500
Fish for sale!

217
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,110
Fresh fish!

218
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,390
Fish for sale!

219
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,850
Wait.

220
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,820
Fresh fish!

221
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,780
Come and have a look!

222
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
Fish for sale!

223
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,110
Fish for sale!

224
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,270
Come and have a look!

225
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,710
Fresh fish!

226
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,430
Fresh fish!

227
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,560
Come and have a look!

228
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,360
Sir.

229
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,150
What do you want?

230
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,010
Help yourself.

231
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,150
How much is the fish?

232
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,520
It depends on how many you want.

233
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,240
Sir, here.

234
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,560
King of the East Sea.

235
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,320
I just got it from the sea.

236
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,670
Look, it looks good.

237
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,710
Not too agile.

238
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,710
Have one, sir.

239
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,590
Don't worry, Mr. Kang.

240
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,700
Didn't we arrest communists before?

241
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,070
I'll follow this lead

242
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,010
intently.

243
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,750
I believe

244
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,070
we'll resolve it soon.

245
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,870
Don't worry.

246
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,750
If there's news,

247
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,410
I'll update you immediately.

248
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,530
Yes.

249
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,230
Sir.

250
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,780
We have news.

251
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,240
A clerk said

252
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,950
Li Shengda bought a boat ticket to Hong Kong.

253
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,950
It’s for tonight.

254
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,660
Take a team

255
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,970
to stop him at the dock.

256
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,380
Yes.

257
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,250
Be careful.

258
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,240
Hurry and move.

259
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:13,910
Move.

260
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,830
Routine check.

261
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,030
Move over.

262
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,750
Separate yourselves!

263
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,960
Separate yourselves!

264
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,890
Stay to the side.

265
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,740
Move.

266
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,740
This way.

267
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,680
Come out.

268
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,890
Listen up.

269
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,330
This price will only

270
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,410
bring you to Zhoushan.

271
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,070
What?

272
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,270
Only...

273
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,870
Only to Zhoushan?

274
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,510
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

275
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,350
If you want to go further,

276
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,410
you have to rent another boat.

277
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,400
The price is negotiable.

278
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,470
As long as we can get out.

279
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,070
Let's get to Zhoushan first.

280
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,100
When will the boat arrive?

281
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,390
Wait here.

282
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,350
I'll go to the dock.

283
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,910
When the boat is here,

284
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,870
I'll come get you.

285
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,710
Go now!

286
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,770
Wait a minute.

287
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,410
Hurry up.

288
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,990
Turn around!

289
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,080
Biao.

290
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,230
The boat to Hong Kong is leaving soon.

291
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,490
Li Shengda is not on it.

292
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,450
He must've realized we're here

293
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,250
and is hiding.

294
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,960
Split up and search.

295
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,030
Don't miss any corner.

296
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,630
Yes.

297
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,950
Li Shengda!

298
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,450
You guys...

299
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,610
Can you be more careful

300
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,630
on field operations?

301
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,660
Look at how you're dressed.

302
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,780
All fierce

303
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,000
and sturdy.

304
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,040
Even the blind knows

305
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,230
who you're working for.

306
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,320
Li Shengda is a veteran.

307
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,490
Would he show up

308
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,100
with you lot there?

309
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,570
Captain.

310
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,110
What should we do now?

311
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,780
Keep an eye on Wei Ruolai.

312
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,720
If we lose this lead,

313
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,540
you will be

314
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
fired.

315
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,890
Yes!

316
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,560
Did you get rid of the traitors?

317
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,800
We've got the lifesaving fish.

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,849
Be careful.

319
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,350
[Hong Fang Clothing Shop]

320
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,070
Mr. Xu.

321
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,700
Don't be nervous.

322
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,330
It's me.

323
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,570
You scared me.

324
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,450
I'm worried about you. Don't be angry.

325
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,270
How is it?

326
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,110
Did you get rid of the traitors?

327
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,790
Congratulations.

328
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,500
You've worked hard.

329
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:45,830
Here.

330
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,720
Have a seat.

331
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,640
Look

332
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,290
what I brought you.

333
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,710
Wontons.

334
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,190
Yes.

335
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,070
From your favorite street stall.

336
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,840
Eat up.

337
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,410
It'll taste bad when soggy.

338
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,670
We've got the gold bars.

339
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,630
Next,

340
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,280
we should rescue those comrades.

341
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,580
It's none of your business.

342
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,110
I've arranged everything.

343
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,110
Your task now is to keep an eye on your brother.

344
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,360
The boss thought

345
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,870
your work report

346
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,310
was very valuable.

347
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,910
Your brother is a talent

348
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,800
with unique insights

349
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,370
about the financial industry.

350
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,270
In the future, the base area will also expand its own banks.

351
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,950
Really?

352
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,190
Great.

353
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,330
Money

354
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,630
is vital in battle.

355
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,350
If you want to be steady,

356
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,930
you need support.

357
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,180
A bank

358
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,430
is a long-term solution.

359
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,070
So,

360
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,720
keep working hard.

361
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,230
However,

362
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,140
my brother is very cautious.

363
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,120
He rarely brings his work home.

364
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,570
But I can start with Wei Ruolai.

365
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,160
It might be easier.

366
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:54,690
Okay.

367
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,070
But Wei Ruolai has been targeted.

368
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,000
Li Shengda suddenly disappeared.

369
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,420
The Investigation and Arrest Unit might attack him.

370
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,880
Can your brother save him?

371
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,550
I'm not sure.

372
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,720
He's a communist's brother.

373
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,050
He even met the handler.

374
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,210
He'll be implicated.

375
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,980
Wei Ruolai.

376
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,590
Go to the Safe Business Department.

377
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,560
Why...

378
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,190
What is it?

379
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
Cut the crap. Just go.

380
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,510
Mr. Shen is waiting downstairs.

381
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,060
Hurry up.

382
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,620
Okay.

383
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,430
Secretary Huang, what's wrong?

384
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,340
Nothing.

385
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,510
Go back to your work.

386
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,730
Since my business was established,

387
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,750
other than focusing on business performance,

388
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,880
political activities

389
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
are also rigorously investigated.

390
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,870
If Wei Ruolai

391
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,520
is really involved in this case,

392
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,360
we will

393
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,690
be impartial and get rid of him.

394
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,410
Go in.

395
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,180
They're waiting for you.

396
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,020
Captain Lin,

397
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,130
are you suspicious of Central Bank

398
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,620
or are you doubting

399
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,700
my abilities as the chief of the Department of Government Ethics?

400
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,650
I dare not.

401
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm just doing my job.

402
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,710
Advisor Shen,

403
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,670
don't worry. It won't take long.

404
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,800
Come in.

405
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,800
Sir,

406
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,830
you asked for me?

407
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,290
Captain Lin asked for you.

408
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,980
He needs your cooperation in a case.

409
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,020
You must answer honestly.

410
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,200
Yes.

411
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,170
Did you look at a safe

412
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,440
in the Central Bank a few days ago?

413
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,590
Yes.

414
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,060
What's in the safe?

415
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,970
A case.

416
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Twenty gold bars.

417
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,070
Advisor Shen,

418
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,790
as far as we know,

419
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,130
these 20 gold bars

420
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,920
belong to the Communist Party.

421
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,120
Sir,

422
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,340
this is what my brother left me when he died.

423
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,000
Your brother was a Communist?

424
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,700
Speak.

425
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,910
I didn't know at that time.

426
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,790
When I found out,

427
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,120
I was already involved.

428
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,770
Sir, I swear

429
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,310
I'm not a Communist.

430
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,370
No need to say that.

431
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,470
We'll look into it ourselves.

432
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,630
Give the safe's key

433
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,090
and the deposit certificate to Captain Lin.

434
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,040
I don't have it.

435
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,380
Where is it?

436
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,050
I gave it to a friend of my brother.

437
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,330
His name is Li Shengda.

438
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,120
Why would you do that?

439
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,740
Who would give such an important thing

440
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,650
to an outsider?

441
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,390
These gold bars were like

442
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,430
hot potatoes to me.

443
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,360
I was scared too.

444
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,350
My brother asked me to hand them over.

445
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,230
If I didn't,

446
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,010
I'd let my brother down.

447
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,770
If I did,

448
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,510
I knew I'd be suspected of colluding with the Communists,

449
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,670
so I wanted to quickly—

450
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,030
Who is Li Shengda?

451
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,010
Why did you give him the gold bars?

452
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,250
He said he's a communist.

453
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,110
Then you colluded with the Communists.

454
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,070
I didn't want to give it to him.

455
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,250
He threatened me.

456
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,350
Now, he has the gold bars.

457
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,610
You should go find him.

458
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,790
I followed him before.

459
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,090
He works at Rixin Bookstore.

460
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,490
I also called the police.

461
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,510
You can check the police record if you don't believe me.

462
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,270
I asked.

463
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,150
Someone called the police

464
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,800
to report you for selling banned books

465
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,030
and colluding with Communists.

466
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,490
Colluding with Communist?

467
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,170
This is too strange.

468
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,530
Captain Lin,

469
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,520
am I being targeted?

470
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,250
You called the police?

471
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,710
Yes.

472
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,740
Captain Lin.

473
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,210
Captain Lin?

474
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,000
if you verify the report

475
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,760
and Wei Ruolai did call the police,

476
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,560
it means that there is no problem

477
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,110
with his political stance.

478
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,870
Yes.

479
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,410
Chief Deng,

480
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,070
according to the rules and regulations,

481
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,590
what should we do with Wei Ruolai?

482
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,590
But Advisor Shen,

483
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,000
the fact that he colluded with the Communist Party is confirmed.

484
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,730
I've already turned myself in.

485
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,820
You turned yourself in?

486
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,960
I wrote a confession letter a few days ago

487
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,820
and mailed it to the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

488
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,710
Wenbiao.

489
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,260
Captain.

490
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,700
Call and ask

491
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,420
if they received

492
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,710
any letters these past few days.

493
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,240
Yes.

494
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,590
The envelope is from the power company.

495
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,640
You work in the Central Bank,

496
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,090
but you used a power company's envelope?

497
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,060
I worked as a typesetter at a printing factory.

498
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,050
After the boss went bankrupt,

499
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,980
he gave envelopes as our salaries.

500
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,770
What did you say in the letter?

501
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,920
Sir,

502
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,480
I wrote all the details

503
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,810
of this matter clearly.

504
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,350
Sir,

505
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,300
there is indeed a letter,

506
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,260
but it doesn't have a name.

507
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,640
Someone threw it in the newspaper basket.

508
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,450
Go get it.

509
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,150
Go get it!

510
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,270
Captain Lin.

511
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,760
I think we should stop

512
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,190
affecting the bank's regular operations.

513
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,340
Let's wait somewhere else.

514
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,750
Okay.

515
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,640
Please.

516
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,070
Sir.

517
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,510
Captain Lin, have you finished?

518
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,870
Captain Lin.

519
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,590
May I?

520
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,160
What happened that day?

521
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,900
Any updates?

522
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,760
No.

523
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,330
Will they come to you again?

524
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,520
They probably will.

525
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,510
Probably

526
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,230
in a few days.

527
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,430
What should we do?

528
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,710
Why don't you run?

529
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,600
No need.

530
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,920
I wrote a confession letter

531
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,350
and clearly wrote

532
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,510
all the details.

533
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,830
I mailed it to the Investigation and Arrest Unit,

534
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,460
requesting them to protect the gold bars,

535
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,450
catch the communists,

536
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,450
and clear my name.

537
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,200
Why did you write a confession letter?

538
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,350
If I turn myself in,

539
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,230
I'll definitely be detained by the Investigation and Arrest Unit

540
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,450
and I won't be able to get out.

541
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,020
So, I wrote an anonymous confession letter

542
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,550
and sent it in the power company's envelope

543
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,670
to the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

544
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,750
Such letters

545
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,420
probably won't be noticed

546
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,390
in a department like theirs.

547
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,110
Plus,

548
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,970
they will think that it's an official document for paying the power bill

549
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,630
and won't pay attention to it.

550
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,770
Most importantly,

551
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,860
the time on the postmark shows

552
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,920
I turned myself in beforehand.

553
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,930
By the time they find out,

554
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,540
I'll already be in the Central Bank.

555
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,200
I bet they won't cause trouble

556
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,920
in front of so many people.

557
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,800
So,

558
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,990
Wei Ruolai already confessed

559
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,550
the entire situation

560
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,880
before you came, right?

561
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,590
There's definitely no problem with his attitude.

562
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,420
In addition,

563
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,510
the gold bars were taken away

564
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,270
because you didn't read the letter in time.

565
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,950
It's not Wei Ruolai's fault.

566
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,680
Mr. Shen.

567
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,390
The postmark on the envelope

568
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,060
can also prove the time I sent the letter.

569
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,260
Shut up!

570
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,680
Captain Lin,

571
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,340
is Wei Ruolai a communist or not?

572
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,920
I want the truth.

573
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,020
According to our current information—

574
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Just say yes or no.

575
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,360
No.

576
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,030
But it's also a fact

577
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,310
that he has unclear connections with this matter.

578
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,040
Then why did he turn himself in?

579
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,110
To put it bluntly,

580
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,110
Wei Ruolai was involved passively.

581
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,230
Because of his brother,

582
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,760
he had no choice but to do so.

583
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,470
Mr. Shen—

584
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,960
Also,

585
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,230
even if his brother is a communist,

586
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,910
can family relations represent one's stance?

587
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,910
Besides,

588
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,210
Wei Ruolai

589
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,610
already reported the communist in time.

590
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,060
I admit that in this matter,

591
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,990
Wei Ruolai must have done

592
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,050
some wrong things.

593
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,510
He didn't report it in time

594
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,310
after he learned everything,

595
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,430
but you all...

596
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,150
Have you found any evidence

597
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,600
of him being a communist?

598
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,180
Have you?

599
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,700
Since you haven't,

600
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,410
the Central Bank

601
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,670
will deal with our own people.

602
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,640
Chief Deng.

603
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,980
Mr. Shen...

604
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,680
Captain Lin, no need for you to meddle in our affairs.

605
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
With all due respect,

606
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,910
if this guy really is a communist...

607
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,640
I'll take the responsibility.

608
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,270
Okay.

609
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,400
That's all I needed to hear.

610
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,290
Goodbye.

611
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,890
You forgot something important.

612
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:29,800
Thank you.

613
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,770
Goodbye.

614
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,890
Do you think

615
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,510
they already

616
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,990
killed Li Shengda?

617
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,620
The communists can't be that fast.

618
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,290
A communist must've been there

619
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,430
the day the meet-up at the Central Bank failed.

620
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,580
If we can keep an eye on Wei Ruolai,

621
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,590
they can do it too.

622
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,110
If Wei Ruolai was willing to cooperate with them,

623
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,710
they could take the gold bars

624
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,960
and kill the traitor.

625
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,310
Sir, how about I arrest Wei Ruolai

626
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,610
and bring him back for interrogations?

627
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,800
Didn't you see Shen Tunan's attitude?

628
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,290
He's just an assistant.

629
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,320
Even if he goes missing,

630
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,050
Shen Tunan won't have the time to worry about him.

631
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,150
Let me

632
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,060
think more about this.

633
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,960
Go back and tell our men

634
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,110
to keep a low profile these days.

635
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,970
Don't let Mr. Kang find an excuse to throw a tantrum.

636
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,640
We're the only few left

637
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,670
from Nanjing.

638
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,090
Don't worry.

639
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,750
When did your brother join the Communist Party?

640
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,320
I don't know, sir.

641
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,550
I really don't know.

642
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,400
After my brother and I came to Shanghai,

643
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,420
my brother always worked

644
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,360
and earned money,

645
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,640
while I went to school.

646
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,300
The days were pretty hard.

647
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,640
Then three years ago, he suddenly disappeared.

648
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,280
My father and I thought he'd died,

649
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,130
until a few days ago, he suddenly showed up.

650
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,030
He said some things to me and then...

651
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,580
And then he really died.

652
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,910
Why didn't you report to it to me promptly?

653
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,040
My brother was a communist, after all.

654
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,070
I just entered the Central Bank.

655
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,500
I was afraid it'd affect my career.

656
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,370
You weren't afraid

657
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,700
that lying to me would affect your career?

658
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,220
I was.

659
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,310
Why did you

660
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,070
give the gold bars to Li Shengda?

661
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,630
Giving the gold bars

662
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,830
to the Investigation and Arrest Unit's informant

663
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,030
or to the government,

664
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,880
would be better than giving it to the Communist Party, right?

665
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,420
What do you think about the Communist Party?

666
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,050
Sir,

667
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,120
I haven't been in contact

668
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,929
with any communists,

669
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,190
other than my brother,

670
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,130
so I don't know much

671
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,230
about them.

672
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
However, I think

673
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,860
a healthy and positive society

674
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,340
should have a top-down system

675
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,620
to distribute wealth

676
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,210
and create the fairest and most reasonable laws

677
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,520
so that the rich can run businesses legally

678
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,310
and the poor can age with security,

679
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,110
instead of how it is now

680
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,750
with most of the wealth concentrated in...

681
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,219
Concentrated where?

682
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,320
I don't dare to say.

683
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,670
What you just described

684
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,820
is a beautiful dream.

685
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,710
Many people have spent their lives

686
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,080
trying to create a country like this,

687
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
some even sacrificing their lives.

688
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,160
I, Shen Tunan,

689
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,070
have made such preparations.

690
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,670
I want to ask you, Wei Ruolai.

691
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,710
What about you?

692
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,930
I'm ready too, sir.

693
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,150
I said before

694
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,700
that my life belongs to you.

695
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,590
Have you taken party theory classes on the Three Principles of the People?

696
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,110
Yes.

697
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,670
Recite the main points to me.

698
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,270
The main points of the class.

699
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,350
One should criticize other social philosophies

700
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,880
according to the Three Principles of the People,

701
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,120
and establish the sole revolutionary outlook of life

702
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,950
with the Three Principles of the People.

703
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,610
From now on,

704
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,890
you should focus all of your energy

705
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,880
on your work.

706
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,940
Don't get distracted again

707
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,250
and don't cause me any more trouble,

708
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:28,960
understand?

709
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,910
Yes, sir.

710
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,740
Go back to work.

711
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,370
Sir,

712
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,790
something bad happened.

713
00:35:59,550 --> 00:35:59,960
Sir...

714
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,550
What's wrong?

715
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,180
I just received news

716
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,190
that someone went to the concession's police station

717
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,810
and bailed the eight communists.

718
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,010
When did this happen?

719
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,740
Around 3 or 4 PM.

720
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,200
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

721
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,710
I went to Luwan for a mission.

722
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,870
I only got the call when I returned to the unit.

723
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,460
I...

724
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,560
I had someone to ask Inspector Henry.

725
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,120
They paid 20 gold bars

726
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,540
and took the people away.

727
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,110
Hurry.

728
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:30,860
Let's go.

729
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,170
We can't wait any longer.

730
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,480
Mr. Song, it's been almost 20 years since the Republic of China was established,

731
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,370
but the tariff control

732
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,120
is still in the hands of some foreign banks.

733
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,230
The more the government needs money,

734
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,740
the more they take advantage of it.

735
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,140
If this goes on, the country will be destroyed.

736
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,550
Tunan,

737
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,670
how can Mr. Chiang and I not know about this?

738
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,470
But it takes time to take back autonomy.

739
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,290
What you're doing

740
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,810
will affect the foreign banks,

741
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,830
especially the interests of those big compradors.

742
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,430
They're able to do anything.

743
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,590
At worst, I'll die. I don't care.

744
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,140
Sir, please rest assured.

745
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,090
If this fails,

746
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,370
this was my own action.

747
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,830
I'm willing to take all the blame.

748
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,650
If this succeeds,

749
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,980
everyone's names will go down in history.

750
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,280
It's just a name.

751
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,810
If the reform is too big, the risks will be unpredictable.

752
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,580
Shang Yang, Wang Anshi, and Zhang Juzheng

753
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,240
all had unfortunate endings.

754
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,340
I only want to

755
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,730
live up to my conscience.

756
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,790
The Shen family is a big family.

757
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,190
They don't need me to carry on the family line.

758
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,990
Okay, I'll publish it right away

759
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,750
and inform all important figures in the financial industry

760
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,010
that, starting today,

761
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,140
you will be the plenipotentiary of the Central Bank

762
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,220
and lead the way to take back tariff autonomy.

763
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,350
Thank you, Mr. Song.

764
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,290
Don't worry.

765
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,320
I will do my best

766
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,820
to carry out the tax reform until the end.

767
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,600
Tell me.

768
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
Are you really a student of Huangpu?

769
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,710
If your instructor knew

770
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,040
what stupid things you've done recently,

771
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,670
he must be so ashamed that he'd commit suicide.

772
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,990
Mr. Kang, I'm sorry.

773
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,740
We...

774
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,300
We?

775
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,630
It's you, Captain Lin.

776
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,560
You get credit for achievements first,

777
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,080
so you need to take responsibility for mistakes too.

778
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,060
You made such a big joke of yourself.

779
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,210
I'm too ashamed to face anyone now.

780
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

781
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,750
It's all my fault.

782
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,790
It has nothing to do with the others.

783
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,440
If a soldier is weak, then a soldier is weak.

784
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,460
If the general is weak, the entire unit is weak.

785
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,880
Why does everyone risk their lives to work under you?

786
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,450
They want to raise families

787
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,930
and get promoted and rich.

788
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,600
Take care of yourself

789
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,150
for the sake of everyone's futures.

790
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,760
Yes.

791
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,770
Open it.

792
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,580
Don't help me.

793
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,500
Lead everyone out.

794
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,270
Get out.

795
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,780
Get out.

796
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,990
Get out.

797
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,270
Yu,

798
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,380
-you're already eating.
-Dad.

799
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,230
Here.

800
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,610
Where's Jinzhen?

801
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,870
I think she's quite busy these days.

802
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,410
She often comes home late.

803
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,080
If you see her,

804
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,150
talk to her.

805
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,300
You talk to her.

806
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,990
It's not safe to come home

807
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,890
so late.

808
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
I don't see her.

809
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,390
If I could see her,

810
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,120
I would definitely talk to her.

811
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,220
Cishu.

812
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,560
Ask Jinzhen. If she's free,

813
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,860
why don't you two

814
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,460
bring Yu back to the hometown for a few days?

815
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,730
Back to the hometown?

816
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,990
What for?

817
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,230
Fourth Uncle

818
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,520
is not in good health.

819
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,500
I can't leave,

820
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,030
so please visit him for me.

821
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,400
After all, he treated Jinzhen and I

822
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,930
very well when we were kids.

823
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,110
Tunan.

824
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,410
What's wrong?

825
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,740
Are you planning something big recently?

826
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,060
No.

827
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,430
Don't think too much.

828
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,390
Otherwise, you won't send us away.

829
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,950
You can't hide it from me.

830
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,460
Don't worry. Things are chaotic recently.

831
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,280
We won't go out.

832
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,270
A family must be together.

833
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,040
We can't let others laugh at us.
