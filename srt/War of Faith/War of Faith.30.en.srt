If we catch Shen Jinzhen,

we'll complete our task.

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,350
The communists like to travel by water.

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,080
I even thought you were the most loyal person

194
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,190
to the Kuomintang,

195
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,780
but your sister hid by your side

196
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,400
for so many years.

197
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,000
Did you not notice anything?

198
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080
Are you stupid or blind?

199
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,850
He's both stupid and blind.

200
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,230
Keep an eye on him.

201
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,460
Don't let unrelated people

202
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,520
get close to him.

203
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,200
His life is still very important.

204
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,960
Yes.

205
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,280
The heavens are watching.

206
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,610
Shen Tunan, you deserve this.

207
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,110
Great.

208
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,910
Amazing.

209
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,240
How relieving.

210
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,390
It'll be hard to explain to Mr. Song.

211
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,530
Not at all.

212
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,540
His sister is a communist.

213
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,690
This alone

214
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,320
is troubling enough for him.

215
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,300
Besides, he stopped the Investigation and Arrest Unit from arresting a communist.

216
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,270
What does that mean?

217
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,800
He could be a communist too.

218
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,950
Bring him down

219
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,550
and take down the Central Bank.

220
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,350
We'll never have difficulties in Shanghai again.

221
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,990
We must go full out this time.

222
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,700
We can't let him make a comeback.

223
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,030
I'm here to see my husband.

224
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,740
Sorry.

225
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,320
There's a suspect inside the ward.

226
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,750
Without Captain Lin’s permission,

227
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,120
no one is allowed to visit.

228
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,850
Step aside.

229
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,820
What?

230
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,410
You want to break in?

231
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,160
Captain.

232
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,260
Sorry, Mrs. Shen.

233
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,839
You can enter.

234
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,599
Not the items.

235
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,650
I can't even bring a book?

236
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,490
What's she so arrogant for?

237
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,680
After Shen Tunan is taken down,

238
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,500
she'll be sold to the brothel sooner or later.

239
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,100
I'll visit her every day.

240
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,240
If you have the money,

241
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,080
why don't you save it

242
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,480
for your mother to live well for a few days?

243
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,800
Yes.

244
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,140
Lu Fang

245
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,580
and the allied

246
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,500
Xiongnu-Wuhuan army

247
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,780
attacked countless times.

248
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,000
The emperor sent

249
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,750
cavalry general

250
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,300
Du Mao

251
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,890
and other generals

252
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,020
and soldiers to defend the north.

253
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,210
They repaired

254
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,500
passageways,

255
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,700
built

256
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,480
barriers,

257
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,200
and constructed

258
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,690
watch towers.

259
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,190
They fought hundreds of battles

260
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,260
of varying sizes

261
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,050
against the Xiongnu-Wuhuan army

262
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,540
but could not

263
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,530
defeat them.

264
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,360
The emperor ordered

265
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,640
Dou Rong and prefects of five counties to the palace.

266
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,600
They followed the edict.

267
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,530
[Jiangxi]

268
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,620
The officials and soldiers that followed

269
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,350
brought more than 1,000 carts,

270
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,200
and horses, cows, and sheep

271
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,510
everywhere.

272
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,850
After arriving,

273
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,270
Dou Rong went to the city gate

274
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,890
and handed over the seal and ribbon.

275
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,140
An envoy was ordered

276
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,120
to return the marquis seal and ribbon.

277
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,150
The emperor met Dou Rong

278
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,830
and rewarded him heavily.

279
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,590
There are many mountains in Jiangxi,

280
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,270
like Lushan, Sanqing, and Mount Longhu.

281
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,770
There's also the Jinggang Mountains.

282
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,620
It's the place I want to go most in my life.

283
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,690
The revolutionary base.

284
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,350
Yes.

285
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,080
At this moment, I should express myself with a song.

286
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,200
Unfortunately, I can't sing.

287
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,990
I can sing,

288
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,230
but I'm afraid you won't dare to listen.

289
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,950
Sing it.

290
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,600
♫Red Army, take your time♫

291
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,560
♫Be careful of the stones on the road♫

292
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,750
♫Don't let them hurt your toes♫

293
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,030
Later, Dou Rong was appointed as governor of Jizhou,

294
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,190
Liang Tong

295
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,590
as the official in charge of discussions,

296
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,200
and Magistrate Kong Fen of Guzang

297
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,560
as the governor of Wudu.

298
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,540
Guzang

299
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,660
was the richest land in Hexi.

300
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,470
The country was unstable

301
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,440
and the officials had no moral integrity.

302
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,460
The magistrate

303
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,300
accumulated a fortune

304
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,330
in just a few months.

305
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,310
Kong Fen was in the position for four years

306
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,550
and worked cleanly,

307
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,530
but he was mocked by all

308
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,430
-for being surrounded by riches but not taking it for himself.
-It’s raining.

309
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,640
Hurry and find shelter against the rain.

310
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,360
Hurry up.

311
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,080
Here.

312
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,900
Be careful.

313
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:19,560
Hurry.

314
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,230
Are you okay?

315
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,550
Why is it suddenly raining so heavily?

316
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,480
This is how rain in Jiangxi is like.

317
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,500
Jinzhen said

318
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,420
when you were young,

319
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,460
you loved reading Zizhi Tongjian the most.

320
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,490
It's a book to teach people how to be officials.

321
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,710
You always said

322
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,110
that if China

323
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
still didn't change,

324
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,150
it'd be destroyed,

325
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,390
so you wanted to

326
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,090
be an official.

327
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,970
You wanted to save the country.

328
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,750
I'm thinking

329
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,140
that if I didn't

330
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,920
act stupid at that time

331
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,820
and break off the engagement,

332
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,060
if I stopped you from studying abroad,

333
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,140
would our family

334
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,610
be happier

335
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,420
right now?

336
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,600
Tunan.

337
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,960
You also said

338
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,210
that you want to

339
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,250
take the entire family

340
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,200
to travel the world.

341
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,840
You promised me.

342
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,810
You promised Yu too.

343
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,280
I know how you are.

344
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,480
You always keep your word.

345
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,990
You never lie to us

346
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,050
and never let us down.

347
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,400
Tunan.

348
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,290
I'm very happy

349
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,160
to have you

350
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,180
and Yu.

351
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,660
I'm sorry

352
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,750
for worrying you.

353
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,310
I knew it.

354
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,320
I knew you'd wake up.

355
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,820
It's been hard on you.

356
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,670
Ruolai,

357
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,230
the soil is red.

358
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,600
It means we've arrived in southern Jiangxi.

359
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,330
We'll be there soon, Miss Shen.

360
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,190
Don't call me Miss Shen anymore.

361
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,470
The young lady Shen Jinzhen from before

362
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,430
is gone.

363
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,750
I'm now comrade Shen Jinzhen

364
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,480
who has joined the revolution.

365
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,940
Just call me Jinzhen.

366
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,180
Okay.

367
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,590
Jinzhen.

368
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,270
Are you a big official in the Communist Party?

369
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,690
Do you need something?

370
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,180
If you have a say in things,

371
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,210
can you...

372
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,770
Ask which unit Liao Si is in?

373
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,920
What are you talking about?

374
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,310
Nothing.

375
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,750
She said she'll treat us

376
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,810
to something nice in Jiangxi Soviet.

377
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,350
Okay.

378
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,880
[Jiren Hospital]

379
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,030
Forget it. I won't drink more.

380
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,910
Cishu,

381
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,950
is there any news of Jinzhen?

382
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,890
No.

383
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,590
She left with Ruolai.

384
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,810
When did she join the Communist Party?

385
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:47,740
Do you know?

386
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,880
Probably when she was in Germany.

387
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,190
She had some friends who studied philosophy.

388
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,110
One of them

389
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,400
must have been a communist.

390
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,550
It's my fault.

391
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,390
I should've paid more attention to her.

392
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,730
There's nothing bad about joining the Communist Party.

393
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,710
Cishu, what are you talking about?

394
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,610
Everything the Kuomintang has done

395
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,030
have all been immoral.

396
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,710
How many people

397
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,910
were cheated by the construction treasury bills?

398
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,790
The newspapers don't report about it anymore

399
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,390
and the marches are gone now,

400
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,130
but everyone has a scale in their hearts.

401
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,750
So,

402
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,710
we have to work harder

403
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,640
to save our country's reputation.

404
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,370
We have to work harder.

405
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,450
You have something to say?

406
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,490
They have dismissed you.

407
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,140
Who?

408
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,130
Who made this decision?

409
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,630
The Department of Government Ethics

410
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,390
and...

411
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,710
Who else?

412
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,880
Mr. Song.

413
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,270
After your accident,

414
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,400
everyone wanted to stay away from you.

415
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,360
In order to protect you,

416
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,520
Mr. Song

417
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,570
even published your obituary on the newspaper.

418
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,390
My obituary?

419
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,740
Why?

420
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,140
Why?

421
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,420
Because of Jinzhen.

422
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,990
If Mr. Song didn't do that,

423
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,680
I don't think even he could guarantee that he could

424
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,730
suppress this matter.

425
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,020
So he published my obituary?

426
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,090
I am a dead person now, right?

427
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,590
Am I a dead person now?

428
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,020
-I'm dead—
-Listen to me.

429
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,870
Tunan, what's wrong?

430
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,970
What's wrong, Tunan?

431
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,680
Wait for me. I'll call the doctor.

432
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,980
The headache is an organic disease caused by

433
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,870
severe trauma to the brain.

434
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,400
Can it be cured?

435
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,590
You can have a foreign doctor perform cranial surgery,

436
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,780
but it's very risky.

437
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,850
I personally don't recommend it.

438
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,030
Will the surgery

439
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,870
have sequelae?

440
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,990
Maybe.

441
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,790
He will get headaches when he gets emotional.

442
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,130
The condition will worsen with age.

443
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,570
Doctor,

444
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,230
is there any other way?

445
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,970
Go back. You can't go out.

446
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,150
-I want to be discharged.
-Go back.

447
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,990
You can't leave without Chief Kang's order.

448
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,270
Go back and tell Mr. Kang

449
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,630
I'm just a dead person now.

450
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,450
I'm not a threat to him.

451
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,670
Is he afraid of a dead man?

452
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,390
Let me out.

453
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,110
Go back.

454
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,910
Don't pull me.

455
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,350
Thank you, doctor.

456
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,820
Tunan, what are you doing?

457
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,030
I want to go home.

458
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,110
What do you think?

459
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,150
I think we can send him back.

460
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,530
We can't keep him in the hospital forever.

461
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,880
It'll be hard to keep an eye on him once he goes back.

462
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,300
The obituary has been released.

463
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,870
Shen Tunan is completely doomed.

464
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,870
Not necessarily.

465
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,670
Mr. Song values him.

466
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,660
When he recovers,

467
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,660
Mr. Song might give him another chance.

468
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,710
Mr. Kang.

469
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,760
Shen Tunan's sister is a communist

470
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,580
and his student joined the communists too.

471
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,240
How can he still have a chance?

472
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,440
Your instructor was a communist

473
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,440
and treated you like his son,

474
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,510
but I still gave you a chance, didn't I?

475
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:02,990
Forget it.

476
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,350
Ignore him.

477
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,970
Let him go back.

478
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,140
He's just a dead man.

479
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,530
If he gets into trouble with us again,

480
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,190
we'll get someone to kill him.

481
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,710
Shen Tunan is dead anyway.

482
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,190
Tastes great.

483
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,590
Dad.

484
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,180
Yu.

485
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,860
What's wrong?

486
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,830
Why are you crying?

487
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,150
Don't cry.

488
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,510
It's my fault.

489
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,290
I made you and Mom worried.

490
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,230
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,110
Dad is bad.

492
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Dad is not good,

493
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,350
but I missed you so much.

494
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,020
I missed you too.

495
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,440
Don't cry.

496
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,520
Dad is back. It's alright.

497
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,480
Don't cry, Yu.

498
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,870
Alright, Yu. don't cry.

499
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,240
We're home!

500
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,180
Jinzhen,

501
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,700
we used to herd cows there when we were kids.

502
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,380
Yes.

503
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,980
Look, my home is over there.

504
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,570
♫The sun is rising♫

505
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,590
♫That bit of red there♫

506
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:10,660
♫Poling a boat year-round♫

507
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,650
♫Going out to pole a boat♫

508
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,490
♫Going out to make money♫

509
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,010
It's a Jiangxi specialty.

510
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,100
You three don't look like locals.

511
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,530
Are you here to move in with relatives or do business?

512
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,930
Sir,

513
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,190
we're riding the boat

514
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,240
and you're steering it.

515
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,750
Why do you ask so many questions?

516
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,110
Miss, what did you say?

517
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,830
Louder. I can't hear you.

518
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,950
We're from Jiangxi. We're here to move in with relatives.

519
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,220
Move in with relatives?

520
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

521
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,170
The dock is all deserted.

522
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,700
There are no homes.

523
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,220
How could there be a ferry without people

524
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,150
and what boat would you be poling?

525
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,480
Boatman,

526
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,070
we want to get off.

527
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,550
What are you doing?

528
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,460
Get to the shore, you hear me?

529
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,670
Ruolai, hurry!

530
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,860
Come to the shore!

531
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,460
Don't move.

532
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,180
Tie them up.

533
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,220
Wait.

534
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,150
I am me.

535
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,160
Point the gun down and don't shoot.

536
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,760
Which hill is your turf?

537
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,690
Cut the crap. Tie them up.

538
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,660
Calm down.

539
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,740
What are you doing?

540
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,650
Don't you know the rules?

541
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,720
Are you from the Green Gang or Hong Gang

542
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,830
or some other group?

543
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,130
The Green Gang or Hong Gang?

544
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,330
I'm not from any of that. Take them away.

545
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,830
Song.

546
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,790
Good job, Kong.

547
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,650
You caught a Kuomintang again?

548
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,150
Three of 'em.

549
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,190
There are two women.

550
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,730
The Kuomintang is really impatient this time.

551
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,560
Comrade,

552
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,110
are you from the Red Army?

553
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,330
I'm an underground agent.

554
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,500
Yeah right.

555
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,820
When you paid for the boat just now,

556
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,600
I saw it.

557
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,430
The Kuomintang's customs gold units

558
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,510
are only circulated

559
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,870
in big cities like Shanghai and Nanjing.

560
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,870
Why do you have it?

561
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,770
And this woman.

562
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,820
She's from the streets.

563
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,510
She tried doing street talk with me.

564
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,120
I thought you were a kidnapper.

565
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,550
If I didn't say anything, I'd just be waiting for death.

566
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,310
Behave yourself.

567
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,230
Comrade,

568
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,870
My name is Shen Jinzhen.

569
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,090
I'm an underground agent from the Shanghai communication center.

570
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,949
The Shanghai organization suffered heavy losses.

571
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,429
We transferred here

572
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,580
through the underground transportation line.

573
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,159
Do you have the letter of introduction?

574
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:21,820
Yes.

575
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,960
Don't move.

576
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,469
Chunmiao.

577
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,159
Chunmiao.

578
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:27,989
Hurry!

579
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,480
Let go of her.

580
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,639
I'd like to see what she's capable of.

581
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
Help me.

582
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,469
Come here.

583
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:41,690
Behave!

584
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,370
Don't move.

585
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,300
I'm really sorry.

586
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,800
It's foggy in the mountain

587
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
and it rained too,

588
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,850
but please...

589
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,820
Comrade, please report to the organization

590
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,190
to verify my real identity.

591
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,310
Keep lying.

592
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,020
Speak.

593
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,090
The two of us aren't communists.

594
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,740
You're speaking the truth so quickly.

595
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,120
What did the Kuomintang give you

596
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,390
to make you come on a suicide mission?

597
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,240
The two of them aren't communists,

598
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,000
but in Shanghai,

599
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,060
they executed an important mission for the organization

600
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,420
and made great contributions.

601
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,820
After I verify my identity,

602
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,460
I'll report the situation to the organization truthfully.

603
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,720
Fine, but before your identity is verified,

604
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,890
you three will have to suffer a bit.

605
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,180
I understand.

606
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,140
Cut the crap. Take them away.

607
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,330
-Go.
-Go.

608
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,350
Sir,

609
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,550
I'm sorry.

610
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,830
They emptied your office.

611
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,860
I brought all your things back.

612
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,860
They are all here.

613
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,510
Sit down.

614
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,090
Let's sit and chat.

615
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,360
Has my matter

616
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,070
affected you?

617
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,440
I don't know yet.

618
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,030
However,

619
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,590
when the emperor changes, the ministers must change too.

620
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,720
You lost your power.

621
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,770
I won't be much better off.

622
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,390
If they do anything to you,

623
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,310
just tell me.

624
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,920
Worst case scenario, go work elsewhere.

625
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,720
I still have some friends in the financial industry.

626
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Don't you want to fight for it again?

627
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,830
For what?

628
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,570
It's true that Jinzhen is a communist.

629
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,890
Mr. Song must want to protect me,

630
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,760
but the chairman won't agree.

631
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,890
Mr. Song can't do much.

632
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,810
I can't ask for more.

633
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,530
Recently, I heard that Mr. Kong

634
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,580
has requested him

635
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,340
to hand over the management rights of the Central Bank as soon as possible.

636
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,550
It's just an internal fight.

637
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,490
Congyun, don’t say that.

638
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,550
Mr. Song is different from them.

639
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,220
Sir,

640
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,030
when you were seriously injured,

641
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,270
he didn't stop Kang Shaojie.

642
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,610
Instead, he decided to publish your obituary.

643
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,940
What was his intention?

644
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,810
Sir,

645
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,920
Chief Deng is here.

646
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,870
Tunan.

647
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm really sorry.

648
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,710
I wasn't able to visit you in the hospital,

649
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,830
so I couldn't come see you until now.

650
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,020
How is your recovery?

651
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,920
I'm fine.

652
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,610
No need to be so polite. Sit down.

653
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,170
Congyun.

654
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,160
Is everything okay at the bank?

655
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,420
How good can it be without you?

656
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,860
However, Mr. Kang hasn't been sitting idle.

657
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,340
He's been going around

658
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,770
to prove your crime

659
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,720
of colluding with the communists.

660
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,160
Thankfully, Mr. Song

661
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,180
went to the chairman to personally vouch for you,

662
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,090
but he could only save your life.

663
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,880
The condition was to announce publicly

664
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,820
that you have passed away.

665
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,440
They just want to make it impossible

666
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,170
for Mr. Shen to make a comeback.

667
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,620
How much do they hate you?

668
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,710
Who will take over my job after I leave?

669
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,370
It hasn’t been announced yet,

670
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,800
but it’s said to be Mr. Kong’s nephew.

671
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,530
I've seen him before.

672
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,260
He seems loyal and honest,

673
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,720
but he's actually clever and cruel.

674
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,700
In my opinion,

675
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,800
the Central Bank

676
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,830
will be fully under the Kong family's influence now.

677
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,100
That doesn't matter.

678
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,520
What worries me the most

679
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,620
is that the good foundation we built

680
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,950
with all our efforts will be lost in a flash

681
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,910
and the Central Bank will really become

682
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,870
a tool for certain people to embezzle money.

683
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,990
That's for sure.

684
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,350
With your personality,

685
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,410
it's good to leave.

686
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,990
Otherwise, you'll have to endure the unfairness.

687
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,250
I'm not afraid of that.

688
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,530
I just find it unfair for the chairman.

689
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,830
Why are there so many lowly people around him?

690
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,310
That's his family matter.

691
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,710
Let's not worry too much.

692
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,430
From now on, I'll be a free man.

693
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,550
Chief Deng and Congyun, you're welcome

694
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,670
to visit often.

695
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,030
We'll just drink tea and chat.

696
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,320
No business talks.

697
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,400
Okay.

698
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,760
Sometimes, misfortune

699
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,510
is also a blessing.

700
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,000
You wanted to leave before,

701
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
but they refused.

702
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,810
This is a good chance to get free.

703
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,990
It's a good thing.

704
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,950
It's a good thing.

705
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,180
At least I don't have to go against my conscience

706
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,180
to do dirty things for them anymore.

707
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,340
Now,

708
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,530
I feel relieved, to be honest.

709
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,790
There's a bit of disappointment,

710
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,070
but more so,

711
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,850
I feel relaxed.

712
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,370
Really?

713
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:41,850
Yes.

714
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,440
Let's go live abroad.

715
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,350
If you work with them,

716
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,900
you'll become the scapegoat sooner or later.

717
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,980
Why don't we take Yu

718
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,080
overseas

719
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,540
to Germany or England?

720
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,790
As long as the family is together,

721
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,870
anywhere is fine.

722
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,180
We can't go to Germany.

723
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,380
It's not safe now.

724
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,450
How about England?

725
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,560
There's no sun there. It's so depressing.

726
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,760
Then let's go to France.

727
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,180
England is still better.

728
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,150
Their educational conditions are better.

729
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,390
If necessary, we can go to France once a year.

730
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,320
We can go fishing in Nice,

731
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,750
and pick grapes and drink wine in Bordeaux.

732
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,230
Great.

733
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,910
Great.

734
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,200
Get up.

735
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,410
I didn't expect you really to be one of us.

736
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,870
Everything is clear now.

737
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,310
The reply from Shanghai has arrived.

738
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,440
I'll personally escort you to Ruijin.

739
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,310
Great!

740
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,350
Let me introduce myself.

741
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,350
I'm Kong Lingzheng,

742
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,390
commander of the special company

743
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,430
under the Central Bureau of Foreign Trade.

744
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,360
Nice to meet you.

745
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,810
No, it's nice to meet you, Wei Ruolai.

746
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,270
I've been waiting for you.

747
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,100
You know me?

748
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,920
I've heard about you long ago.

749
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,350
You're an employee of the Central Bank

750
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,680
and a financial genius.

751
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,480
I was just an assistant.

752
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,270
Don't be modest.

753
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,040
You are the talent

754
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,350
that we need the most now.

755
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,830
Whenever our director mentions you,

756
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,310
he practically drools.

757
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,190
Let me introduce everyone.

758
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,710
This is our deputy company commander, Song Shoutian.

759
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,390
His nickname is Discipline Song.

760
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,990
Welcome to Jiangxi Soviet.

761
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,350
From now on, we are comrades.

762
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,430
Welcome.

763
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,910
Nice to meet you.

764
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,970
-Welcome.
-Hello.

765
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,150
Welcome.

766
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,400
You must be Shen Jinzhen,

767
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,540
senior engineer of the arsenal.

768
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,620
Do you know me?

769
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,220
No.

770
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,120
But our superiors said you are a technical talent.

771
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,390
You're more valuable than gold.

772
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,950
He asked us to protect you

773
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,950
at all costs.

774
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,150
So snobbish.

775
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,460
I guess you just ignore those who aren't talents.

776
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,060
Niu Chunmiao.

777
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,390
You know me?

778
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,910
After the name list was handed in,

779
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,370
someone recognized your name immediately.

780
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,010
Comrade Liao Chunfeng

781
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,280
has died.

782
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,360
When?

783
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,630
In the last encirclement siege,

784
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,220
he died with two enemies.

785
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,050
Before he died,

786
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,050
he had some words to say to you.

787
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,050
Ruolai is great

788
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,910
and suits you too.

789
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,440
He told you to be satisfied with what you have.

790
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,270
Nonsense!

791
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,550
Jinzhen.

792
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,730
Jinzhen.

793
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,080
He's talking nonsense.
