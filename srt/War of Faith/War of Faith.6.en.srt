[Episode 6]

4
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,789
Come in.

5
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,750
Sir.

6
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,070
This is the official letter which I will be sending out today.

7
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,670
It requires your signature.

8
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,380
Are you feeling better?

9
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,390
Much better.

10
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,090
Did you go to the restaurant I asked you to?

11
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,560
Yes, it was delicious.

12
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,880
Is something bothering you?

13
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,360
No, Sir.

14
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,920
No?

15
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,730
Look. It's such a big mistake.

16
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,820
And you didn't notice when you were proofreading it?

17
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,410
Sorry, Sir.

18
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll change it now.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,010
Come back.

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,240
Wei Ruolai.

21
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,510
Do you think that you can rest your heart,

22
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,520
now that you are officially employed?

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,180
No.

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,260
Let me tell you.

25
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,600
When I chose to hire you,

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,360
it was because I appreciated your character the most,

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,560
in addition to valuing your abilities.

28
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,520
But now, I can't help but wonder...

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,160
you were just pretending before, right?

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,760
No.

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,400
Absolutely not, Sir.

32
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,550
The final exam is coming soon.

33
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,610
You know what you have to do.

34
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,240
Yes.

35
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,950
Sorry, Sir.

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,450
There's a new cafe that just opened across the street.

37
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,710
Let's go and have a try.

38
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,380
I'm not going. You go ahead.

39
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,730
Fine.

40
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,560
I'll go then.

41
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,110
Okay.

42
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,980
Bye.

43
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,530
Bro.

44
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,730
Are you here to look at the exchange rates too?

45
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,550
I don't understand today's exchange rates.

46
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,410
Why not?

47
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,400
Wall Street has collapsed, and the world is going into economic depression.

48
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,260
We need to keep an eye on those that are in the yellow.

49
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,210
Then...

50
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,690
What about those in the green?

51
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,530
How much do you have?

52
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,190
I have connections who are offering higher than the black market.

53
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,050
Sorry, I don't have any.

54
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,409
What are you doing here without any goods?

55
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,610
You seemed so real.

56
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,170
Crazy.

57
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,180
Thank you.

58
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,720
This is the 5th page of

59
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,090
tomorrow's newspaper.

60
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,150
It contains important information.

61
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,940
Biao Zi,

62
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,130
you and your brothers go memorise the more significant titles of each page,

63
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,420
from the 25th issue of this month's Shen Bao Newspaper,

64
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,150
in order to confirm the target.

65
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,930
Sir, it's confirmed.

66
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,670
He's the guy who is holding yesterday's Shen Bao Newspaper.

67
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,620
Wei Ruolai.

68
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,180
Why are you here?

69
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,440
Miss Shen.

70
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,400
I...

71
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,980
What happened to your face?

72
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,300
I just bumped into something.

73
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,480
You must have been drunk and fell.

74
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,410
Aren't you my brother's assistant?

75
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,670
Don't you need to work?

76
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm doing something for him right now.

77
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,280
What is it?

78
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,040
You're just sitting here, dawdling away.

79
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,890
You are not working even in this broad daylight.

80
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,020
You don’t want to work anymore, do you?

81
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,950
No, Miss Shen, I...

82
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,520
What's with that expression?

83
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,720
I am being nice when I tell you off,

84
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,880
but now you are feeling wronged?

85
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,130
No, no, no.

86
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,680
Forget it.

87
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,320
I don't want to waste my breath on you.

88
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,450
Where is my brother?

89
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,170
He's on the second floor.

90
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,880
You have nothing to do anyway.

91
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,290
Do something for me then.

92
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,040
The higher-ups are "fighting bandits" in Jiangxi.

93
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,280
The Treasury Department sent some money

94
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,720
for our munition factory to rush out some guns and ammunition.

95
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
But the money is now stuck with Central Bank, and it didn't get sent through.

96
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
Mr. Weng asked me to come over and press on the payment.

97
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,740
You go instead.

98
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,140
Go to the tellers and ask them for the payment.

99
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,090
No, Miss Shen.

100
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm just an assistant.

101
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,210
You will still have to trouble Mr. Shen for matters like these.

102
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,040
You're not only useless, but also lazy.

103
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,900
I really don't know why my brother chose to hire you.

104
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,850
You got caught, didn't you?

105
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,160
Keep an eye on him.

106
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,130
The real handler will definitely come.

107
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,560
Yes.

108
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,400
Yes, it's pretty urgent over here.

109
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,730
Please urge them for me.

110
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,890
Do me a favor.

111
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,540
Consider it as I, as an advisor, owe you a favor.

112
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,510
Okay, thank you.

113
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,200
Jinzhen.

114
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Jinzhen.

115
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,890
A penny for your thoughts?

116
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,590
Nothing.

117
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,700
I've asked for a favour

118
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,600
regarding your factory's funds.

119
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,300
It should be transferred very soon.

120
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,900
Thank you, Advisor Shen.

121
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,860
You're welcome, Engineer Shen.

122
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,230
Anything else?

123
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,130
Yes.

124
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm hungry.

125
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,160
Let's have afternoon tea.

126
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
Go back to your munition factory to eat.

127
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,080
You want to a free meal at our Central Bank?

128
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,940
There's no way.

129
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,130
Also,

130
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,780
next time, if you have business to do,

131
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,820
come earlier.

132
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,650
Line up.

133
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,020
Follow the rules and regulations.

134
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,380
If it weren't for the fact that I was worried you would delay matters,

135
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,210
I wouldn't let you take this back door.

136
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,140
Then don't do it.

137
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,600
Hurry up call them, and tell them to retract the funds.

138
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
We don't want this order either.

139
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,140
Ask the army to wipe out the "bandits" with red-tasseled spears instead.

140
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,390
Who's a bandit?

141
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,160
I think you are the bandit.

142
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,850
You are the biggest bandit.

143
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,390
Wei.

144
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,270
Where have you been?

145
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,770
Mr. Shen has been looking for you.

146
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,900
I'll be right there.

147
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,000
Bye.

148
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,940
Remember to prepare afternoon tea for me next time.

149
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,370
Afternoon tea?

150
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,770
You would even want dinner.

151
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,650
Gosh.

152
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,450
Jinzhen.

153
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,450
Miss Shen.

154
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,770
Miss Shen, I just...

155
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,110
Jinzhen.

156
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,990
Sir.

157
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,120
Are you going home for dinner tonight?

158
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,170
It depends on my mood.

159
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,640
Why would eating be dependent on your mood?

160
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,440
Of course.

161
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,800
Of course not.

162
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,960
Send her downstairs, Ruolai.

163
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,450
Yes.

164
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,890
Don't let her harass anyone.

165
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,530
Miss Shen.

166
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,230
Miss Shen.

167
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm sorry, Miss Shen.

168
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,580
What are you doing?

169
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:29,960
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,930
You were walking just fine,

171
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,980
and then you suddenly turned around.

172
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,130
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

173
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,920
Well,

174
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,460
I just wanted to say that

175
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,730
earlier today, when I was downstairs,

176
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,330
I was indeed not getting work done for Mr. Shen.

177
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,930
You don't need to explain.

178
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,730
I'm not blind.

179
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,960
Well,

180
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,040
please don't tell

181
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,100
Mr. Shen about this, okay?

182
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,970
Today...

183
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,000
Today, it's all my fault.

184
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm really sorry.

185
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,080
I promise I won't do it again.

186
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,250
I really won't. I'm sorry.

187
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,370
Please don't tell Mr. Shen, okay?

188
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,160

Are you here to find Mr. Shen?

Take care, Miss Shen.

Why do I feel something is wrong with Miss Shen?

202
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,160
Why?

203
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,530
The last time when we were ambushing Lonely Star at the cafe,

204
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,320
she was there.

205
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,520
Of all times, she's here again.

206
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,830
Maybe it's a coincidence.

207
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,240
It's normal for her to come to the Central Bank

208
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,330
and ask her brother for a favour.

209
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,920
I never believe in coincidence.

210
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,490
Then you go after her.

Go get her.

212
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,600

Have you contacted Lonely Star?

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,490
There was an ambush.

229
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,250

He didn't come.

What's his relationship with Lonely Star?

I don't know.

240
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,800
But he was holding onto yesterday's Shen Bao Newspaper.

241

a copy of Shen Bao Newspaper in the grand hall of Central Bank.

245
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,240
It should be him.

246
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,740

The Investigation and Arrest Unit might be using Wei Ruolai to arrest his handler.

That's also possible.

Miss Shen's brother is an advisor at the Central Bank,

I'm just thinking

329
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,320
if Imperial Bank is actually going to be acquired by Central Bank,

330
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
then Central Bank

331
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,680
must be managed by someone they are familiar with.

332
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,240
Will they ask you to be the general manager?

333
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,410
I'm just an assistant.

334
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,490

needs stationery like paper, pen and ink?

347
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,760
Don't worry.

348
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,110
The price is very fair.

364
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,140
it'll be disastrous.

It's none of your business.

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,370
If this goes wrong,

369
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,520
you'll be sued and even executed, you know that?

370
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,480
Executed?

371
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,740
Even if they do, they will execute you, not me.

Where is Wei Ruochuan?

374
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,270
Who are you?

375
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,710
I'm asking you, where is Wei Ruochuan?

376
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,220
Why are you looking for my brother?

377
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,670
Your brother?

378
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,590
You are Ruolai?

379
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,710
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,500
Are you really Ruolai?

381
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,900
Your brother told me a lot about you.

382
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,720
I didn't even recognize you.

383
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,920
Look at you.

384
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,930
With your height and poise,

385
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,020
you've changed. You are becoming more and more like a city person.

386
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,560
Why are you looking for him?

387
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,170
I'm looking for your brother

388
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,600
for something very important.

389
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,910
Can you contact him now?

390
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,850
No.

391
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,000
I haven't seen him for a long time.

392
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,200
Okay.

393
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,360
If you see him,

394
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,280
tell him

395
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,010
to terminate the operation

396
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,290
and evacuate immediately.

397
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,370
Who are you?

398
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,760
I’m Li Shengda.

399
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,840
He'll know once you mention my name to him.

400
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,930
What's your relationship with my brother?

401
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,740
A friend.

402
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,440
A friend?

403
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,920
Yes.

404
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,030
I don't think

405
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,730
I've ever heard my brother talk about you.

406
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,330
Then that's right.

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,850
I guess...

408
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,930
your brother hasn't told you

409
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,000
about his real identity.

410
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,210
What real identity?

411
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,720
Your brother

412
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,690
is an underground party member of the Communist Party.

413
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I shouldn't be telling you this.

414
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,050
This is confidential.

415
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,950
But there's no other way.

416
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,150
This is an emergency.

417
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,890
Ruolai, you're the only one who can help me now.

418
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,890
We have a traitor in our organization.

419
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,480
Your brother doesn't know yet.

420
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,940
He may be exposed anytime.

421
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,290
Once arrested,

422
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,840
he will definitely die.

423
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,890
So we need to inform him

424
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,690
to evacuate as soon as possible.

425
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,850
Okay, I understand.

426
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,840
But I can't reach him either.

427
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,960
I'll tell him if I see him.

428
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,840
Okay.

429
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,640
See you.

430
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,380
Wei.

431
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,180
I made you some fish soup

432
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,440
to nourish your body.

433
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,780
Who was the person who just went down?

434
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,850
He said he was my brother's friend.

435
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,360
But I don't think so.

436
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,020
Why?

437
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,170
I just feel that

438
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,040
his temperament wasn't quite right.

439
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Why is it so messy?

440
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,200
What's with his temperament?

441
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,010
A thief must have broken in.

442
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,390
My brother left three years ago, you know that right?

443
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,070
I know.

444
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,680
Before he left,

445
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,480
he was always being mysterious.

446
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,960
I was worried that he was smoking opium

447
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,890
or was gambling,

448
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,670
so I tailed him for a while.

449
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,250
The people whom he came in contact with...

450
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,690
seemed to all have

451
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,460
the same temperament.

452
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,340
What temperament?

453
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,270
You know...

454
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,940
The type that knows they may die any day,

455
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,740
but they're not afraid.

456
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,620
They seemed like...

457
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,470
they had a mission to bear from heaven.

458
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,400
There was a sense of selflessness.

459
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,290
Do you understand?

460
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,690
No.

461
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,440
But the guy today...

462
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,280
He looked very guilty

463
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,460
from his gaze and expression.

464
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,770
He definitely stole something,

465
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,720
but he didn't want to admit it.

466
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,980
Then why didn't you report to the police?

467
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,410
He said he was a communist.

468
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,290
Then all the more you should report to the police.

469
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,620
The reward is very high.

470
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,530
He said...

471
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,890
My brother was a communist too.

472
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,420
And he...

473
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,630
reeked of ink.

474
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,380
And he was using a paper knife.

475
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,040
What does it say?

476
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,530
Rixin.

477
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,190
It seems like a bookstore.

478
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,850
My brother told me about it.

479
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,720
I've never heard of it.

480
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,960
Where is it?

481
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,720
I don’t know.

482
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,810
I don't think it's in Zhabei.

483
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,160
Wei,

484
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,930
what would you do

485
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,090
if your brother really was a communist?

486
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,180
If this gets out,

487
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,760
your life will be over.

488
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,040
Captain Lin.

489
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,850
I'm back.

490
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,760
I don't know how to drink, but thank you.

491
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,840
I've just searched

492
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,410
their house,

493
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,040
but found nothing useful.

494
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,480
I think we can arrest him first,

495
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,050
and bring him back for interrogation.

496
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,130
He's the assistant to a senior management.

497
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,190
Without evidence,

498
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,270
I can't explain to the higher-ups.

499
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,160
We have evidence.

500
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,770
Wei Ruolai and Lonely Star

501
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,020
are brothers.

502
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,920
This is more than enough.

503
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,670
Are you sure?

504
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,090
Yes.

505
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,240
You call this lack of valid evidence?

506
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,470
I'm sorry, Captain Lin.

507
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,240
I was careless.

508
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,230
He admitted it himself.

509
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,520
But I'm not interested in arresting people.

510
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
Compared to that,

511
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,160
I want to know

512
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,630
who is their handler.

513
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,410
What's their purpose?

514
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,070
What is the next step

515
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
in their mission?

516
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,080
No.

517
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,370
He's just a kid.

518
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,240
If you take him back and torture him,

519
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,550
he will confess everything.

520
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,280
At worst, we can give him opium.

521
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,050
You're pretty tough on your comrades.

522
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,970
I don't have any comrades.

523
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,080
Captain Lin,

524
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,590
I'm your man now.

525
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,210
As long as you give the order,

526
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,740
I'll arrest him right away.

527
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,200
Don't worry.

528
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,960
A forced confession is not credible.

529
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,980
That's why

530
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,850
I don't like to torture people.

531
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,580
It's boring.

532
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,760
Then I'll...

533
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,690
find another chance

534
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,190
to get some more information from him.

535
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,160
Try to gain his trust,

536
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,770
before you move him.

537
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,410
Try to get him to

538
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,070
tell you the truth willingly.

539
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,300
Got it.

540
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,340
Then, I'm going to need two more people

541
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,580
to put on a show with me.

542
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,880
Sure.

543
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,610
Anytime.

544
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,270
Thank you, Captain Lin.

545
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,550
If your brother is really a communist,

546
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,800
your life will be over.

00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,720
Sir, who are you looking for?

563
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,490
♫It's all for livelihood♫

564
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,690
I saw in the newspaper that there is a room for rent here.

565
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,280
♫Hustling on the go♫

566
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,360
I am here to ask for a price.

567
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,210
What is it? What is it?

568
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:11,720
Who is it?

569
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,360
Ms. Zhou.

570
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Who are you looking for?

571
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,080
♫They're just afraid of me, Wei Ruolai♫

572
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,250
I'm here to rent.

573
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:17,930
Rent?

574
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,570
You?

575
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,360
Are you kidding?

576
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,600
This is a shanty town. You don't mind it?

577
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,940
♫Life is but a dream♫

578
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,290
As the saying goes, you buy a house for a hundred bucks, but a neighbor for a thousand bucks.

579
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,420
♫I, Wei Ruolai♫

580
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,120
When it comes to renting a place, I think the people are more important than the environment.

581
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:36,100
♫Life is but a dream♫

582
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,040
What I care more about is

583
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,770
whether or not I can get along with the neighbors.

584
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,170
I have a big room upstairs.

585
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,490
Why don't you take a look?

586
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,280
Thank you.

587
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,860
Sure.

588
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,150
Please.

589
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,600
Our rooms here

590
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,970
might be a little old,

591
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,170
but all of us neighbors live in the same alley.

592
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,330
It's very lively.

593
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,020
Let's go upstairs.

594
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
What are you doing, old man?

595
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,120
Sir?

596
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,310
You are here for Ruolai, aren't you?

597
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,040
No, I'm looking for you.

598
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,770
Impossible. I'm already dead.

599
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,080
I don't exist in this world anymore.

600
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,360
Does he know who you are?

601
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,140
I don't even know myself.

602
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,780
How could he know?

603
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,400
Sir,

604
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,790
Central Bank just merged with Imperial Bank.

605
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,840
If you are willing...

606
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,120
I'm not interested.

607
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm perfectly comfortable here.

608
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,880
I play Go as soon as I open my eyes.

609
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,530
I eat when I'm hungry, and sleep when I feel sleepy.

610
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,730
This bankruptcy

611
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,620
allowed me to live for an additional 50 years.

612
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,410
That's good.

613
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,390
Rest more if you're tired.

614
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,370
But when you feel well-rested enough,

615
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,840
and want to venture out again,

616
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,560
we more than welcome you.

617
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,610
You don't have to worry about me.

618
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,370
Aren't you here

619
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,720
for Ruolai this time?

620
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,280
Yes.

621
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,860
I still feel worried

622
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,540
about having him by my side.

623
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,050
He's a good kid.

624
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,760
He's kind-hearted.

625
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,810
There are also no strange people around him.

626
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,450
But look at this environment.

627
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,600
It's quite chaotic.

628
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,530
I'm still worried.

629
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,680
But this kid

630
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,480
is good-tempered and stubborn.

631
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,610
Once he has set his mind on something,

632
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,640
no one can change his mind.

633
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,090
Some time ago, a gangster

634
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,120
tried paying him a fortune to hire him.

635
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,970
He'd rather suffer with you,

636
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,700
and insisted on not hanging out with those guys.

637
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,560
Why would it be suffering with me?

638
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,520
Fine.

639
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,130

640
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:35,800

641
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,890
Sir, Sir.

642
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,890
We are fighting for our country.

643
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,450
How can you compare us

644
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,700
with those greedy bastards?

645
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,880
I won't argue with you.

646
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,210
But if you made this trip

647
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
just to understand Ruolai's character,

648
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,400
I can promise that as long as you give him a chance,

649
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,520
he will never let you down.

650
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,480
If you know his background and experience,

651
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,720
please tell me more. The more detailed, the better.

652
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,530
I can only entrust him with heavier responsibilities,

653
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,610
when I fully understand him,

654
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,270
and can trust him completely.

655
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,950
We are from the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,670

658
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,400
Ask Wei Ruolai to come.

659
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,730
Which year did he enrol?

660
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,550
If I had known, do I still need you to check for me?

661
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,310
Please wait.

662
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,050
Hurry up.

663
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,050
Time's up.

664
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,560

Hand in the paper.

666
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,550
That's it.

667
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,670
Class is over.

668
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,320
Let's go.

669
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,110
Sir,

670
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,120
if there's anything

671
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,490
you ever need from me,

672
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,050
you know where you can find me.

673
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,840
No problem.

674
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,130
But Shen,

675
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,650
you must use him well.

676
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:52,690
I know, Sir.

677
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,830
Let's stop here.

678
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,450
Okay.

679
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,280
See you again.

680
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,110
See you.

681
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,570
Don't tell anyone that you saw me.

682
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,770
Take care.

683
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,710

Who is he?

686
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,650
You look like you know him.

687
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,610
You don't?

688
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,630
Who exactly is he?

689
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,030
He is a scammer

690
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,220
selling shampoo.

691
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,660
No wonder.

692
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,080
He doesn't look like a good person.

693
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,140
He must have stolen

694
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,740
his entire suit of clothes,

695
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,140
and perhaps even his car.

696
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,730
Why would someone like him

697
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,580
come to a place like this to rent?

698
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,190
Isn't it strange?

699
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,930
By the way,

700
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,170
don't tell anyone

701
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,450
I've met him before.

702
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,380
It's better to stay away from him, okay?

703
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,510
Got it.

This is the report card.

717
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,460
Wei Ruolai is at the bottom of the daily assessment?

718
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,330
Is this result objective?

719

Tell me the truth then. Do you want him to stay,

723
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,680
or do you want him to leave?
