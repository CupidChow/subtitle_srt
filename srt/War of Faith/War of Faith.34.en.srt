1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,890
You are my best student.

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,710
You've learned so much financial knowledge from me.

4
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,120
Can't I be sad that you are

5
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,789
working for the communists now?

6
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:40,120
I think working for the Communist Party

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,150
for the Communist Party.

8
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,789
I regret

9
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,000
not returning to Jiangxi Soviet sooner.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,030
What did they do to you

11
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,200
that changed you like this?

12
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,430
The Communist Party cares for the people,

13
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,640
but your party

14
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,590
doesn't even treat them as humans.

15
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,920
Let me ask you one thing.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
The treasury bills incident was so serious,

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,720
but was anyone really punished?

18
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,750
Why do you persist in your mistaken beliefs?

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,760
The Nanjing government is selfish and cruel.

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
They've never cared about the people.

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,190
How dare you!

22
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,470
Shen Jinzhen, how dare you?

23
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,840
Look at you now.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,780
Look how powerful you are now,

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,860
Special Commissioner Tu.

26
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,800
Wei Ruolai,

27
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,400
I trained you back then

28
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,470
to turn you into a pillar of the party-state.

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,560
I didn't expect you to turn into this.

30
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,870
Sir,

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,630
I really hope you can go to Jiangxi Soviet

32
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,070
and see the bright smiles of the people there.

33
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,430
Although they are poor now,

34
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,190
their eyes are full of hope.

35
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,590
They believe that tomorrow will be better.

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,430
Wei Ruolai.

37
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,280
Do you really think I can't bear to kill you?

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,610
What are you going to do?

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,750
No, sir.

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,590
I just feel that sacrificing myself in a mission

41
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,870
is worth it.

42
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,030
It's the direction of the counterfeit money factory.

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Erniu,

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,840
send Qian Fengshi a signal.

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Ask him to reinforce the counterfeit money factory.

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Guys, follow me.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,490
Let's go.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Brigade Commander, Lin sent a signal.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,150
Should we go?

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Your people?

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,630
Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank Special Company.

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,630
Impossible.

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,240
It's night and there are soldiers ambushed along the mountain path.

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,710
They can't catch up to you.

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,090
I guessed the location of the factory.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,240
You guessed it?

57
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,870
Before, I thought about

58
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,310
where I would put

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,970
a counterfeit money factory.

60
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,870
First, it must be concealed.

61
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,590
There are many mountains in Ganzhou.

62
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,630
Even the biggest commotion won't be discovered in the mountains.

63
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,710
There are so many mountains.

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,840
How do you know which mountain it is?

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,360
Second, printing and paper-making both need water.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,750
You need to choose the right water source.

67
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,960
However, these techniques pollute the water source.

68
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,750
The wastewater drained out along the waterway

69
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,280
causes the nearby residents to fall sick,

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,190
get diarrhea, kidney failure, and other conditions.

71
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,390
So I asked someone to check in the hospital.

72
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,600
I have a favor to ask you.

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,390
What is it?

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,000
Take some people to Ganzhou for me.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
If there are any of the below symptoms,

76
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,310
please check one by one.

77
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,680
The villages where patients are concentrated

78
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,600
will be downstream of the water source.

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
Following the water source upstream

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,960
will narrow down the scope a lot.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,720
Third,

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,750
the tire ruts.

83
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,390
The villagers either walk or ride horses.

84
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,320
There are no tire marks on the road.

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,630
When a car passes by,

86
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,230
the grass will be flattened.

87
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,320
Look carefully.

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,830
This narrows the scope even more.

89
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,630
The last point

90
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
is the most important point.

91
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,830
There's smoke from cooking.

92
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,870
Over there. See?

93
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Let's go.

94
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,870
Regular farmers have small stoves.

95
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,150
The concentration of the smoke is low and dissipates in mid-air,

96
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,390
but the printing factory feeds everyone at once.

97
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,150
The smoke is highly concentrated.

98
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,240
At meal times, the smoke will float in the air.

99
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,310
If we combine all the points and screen a few times,

100
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,040
the location of the printing factory is obvious.

101
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,390
You're still very smart, Wei Ruolai.

102
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,000
Since you know where the counterfeit money factory is,

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,040
you didn't have to come in person.

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,500
Why did you risk your life?

105
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,310
If I didn't come, you'd grow suspicious,

106
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,750
increase troops quickly, and cause unnecessary casualties.

107
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,560
Lie down.

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,120
Hide!

109
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,480
Sir, this isn't right.

110
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,270
It should be

111
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,530
Qian Fengshi's men on guard at this hour.

112
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,190
Stop shooting!

113
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Guys over there,

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,480
are you Brigade Commander Qian Fengshi's unit?

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
Which unit are you from?

116
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,800
We're the Ranger Formation,

117
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,830
Ganzhou Detachment.

118
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm Lin Qiaosong.

119
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,560
Captain Lin,

120
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
did you not say beforehand that you'll be coming?

121
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,070
It's hard to see clearly in the dark.

122
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,310
The counterfeit money factory in the mountain

123
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,750
was ambushed by the communists.

124
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,870
We need backup.

125
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,270
We didn't get any notice.

126
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,920
The superiors ordered us to ambush on the spot.

127
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,360
We don't dare to move

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,920
without the superiors' order.

129
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,070
You'll have to

130
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
do the rescue by yourselves.

131
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,950
Qian Fengshi, I'll deal with you later.

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
Please let us through.

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,480
We'll go alone.

134
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,010
Let's go.

135
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,950
Keep up.

136
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
Pull yourselves together.

137
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,430
Don't let go of a single communist.

138
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes.

139
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,430
I came here to destroy the counterfeit money factory.

140
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,190
I also wanted to meet the mastermind in Ganzhou.

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,310
You've seen him.

142
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
What now?

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
You want to take me to Jiangxi Soviet to work for the Communist Party?

144
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Can't I, sir?

145
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,680
Jiangxi Soviet is the future of China.

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,480
Please trust me and visit Jiangxi Soviet with me.

147
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,150
I believe—

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,830
Sir, the Communist Party is too powerful.

149
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,360
We can't hold up any longer.

150
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,870
Run!

151
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,760
Get out! Get out!

152
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,560
Come out!

153
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,630
Hands up!

154
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Who are you?

155
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,390
Sir, I'm not a bandit.

156
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,650
I'm one of the workers.

157
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,070
How many doors are there?

158
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,950
Two doors.

159
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,190
The back door is the workshop.

160
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,120
The front door is the resting area.

161
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,190
Chunmiao,

162
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,750
take two men to find Ruolai and Instructor Shen.

163
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,480
The rest of you, follow me to the printing workshop.

164
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,870
Okay.

165
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,750
Let's go.

166
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,920
Sorry, Wei Ruolai.

167
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,190
I can't go to Jiangxi Soviet with you.

168
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,120
Please come with me.

169
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,830
Let him go.

170
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,870
I can leave with you.

171
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,720
Shen Jinzhen, don't think that I won't dare to shoot.

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
Don't make more mistakes.

173
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,540
Let him go and I'll leave with you.

174
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,560
Sir, we're running out of time.

175
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,159
Go get the car, Congyun.

176
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Tunan,

177
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,830
I said I'll leave with you.

178
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,430
Let him go.

179
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,160
Go.

180
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,070
I can leave with you if you let him go.

181
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,270
I'm telling you to go.

182
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,270
Calm down. Don't do anything stupid.

183
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,800
This way.

184
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,390
Tunan, don't make more mistakes.

185
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,190
Go!

186
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,090
Tell me, where is the workshop?

187
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,240
Inside and on the second floor too.

188
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,870
Sanqiangzi,

189
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,330
burn it!

190
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,280
Young man,

191
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,870
these are the best equipment.

192
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,270
They can still be used after being disassembled.

193
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,600
I heard that you only have one lithograph in Jiangxi Soviet.

194
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,390
Sanqiangzi,

195
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,960
take them apart.

196
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,030
Comrades, take them apart.

197
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,560
Let's go.

198
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,390
Come to Jiangxi Soviet with us.

199
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,200
Go!

200
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,480
Don't move!

201
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,200
Put the gun down!

202
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,929
Don't shoot!

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,669
Don't shoot!

204
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,270
Sir,

205
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,270
put the gun down.

206
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,670
Tunan,

207
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,150
come with us to Jiangxi Soviet.

208
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,910
I'm not going.

209
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,120
I will never betray the Kuomintang.

210
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,790
Instead of being executed in Jiangxi Soviet,

211
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,270
I'd rather kill myself now.

212
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,720
Tunan.

213
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,550
Don't shoot!

214
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,270
Calm down. Think about it.

215
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,670
Think about Yu and Sister-in-law.

216
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,770
Yu is still in the hospital.

217
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,030
If you end your life like this,

218
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,030
what will happen to them in the future?

219
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,870
Okay?

220
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,790
Calm down.

221
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,150
Sir, whether it's the counterfeit money

222
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,120
or the passcode,

223
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
it's just a means to control the economy in Jiangxi Soviet for you,

224
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
but you don't know

225
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,360
what it has brought

226
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,160
to the people of Jiangxi Soviet.

227
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,150
Prices have skyrocketed recently.

228
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,840
Many families have almost died

229
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,910
because of what you did.

230
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,200
We are all Chinese.

231
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,390
Don't you

232
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,840
have any empathy for your own compatriots?

233
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,550
Sir, come to Jiangxi Soviet with us.

234
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,870
I believe your opinion will change

235
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,870
once you're in Jiangxi Soviet.

236
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,870
Trust us, sir.

237
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,150
Tunan,

238
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,440
please trust us.

239
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,600
Come with us.

240
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,320
Tunan.

241
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,190
Take him away.

242
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,410
Don't move!

243
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,570
Don't move.

244
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,870
Let's go.

245
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,840
What about the machines?

246
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,240
We can't carry them away.

247
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,750
This is a Kuomintang-controlled area.

248
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,960
There are enemies down the mountain.

249
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,630
Burn them.

250
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,450
Sanqiangzi.

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,870
Sanqiangzi.

252
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,270
Yes.

253
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,000
Sanqiangzi,

254
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,000
Burn it, comrades!

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Burn it!

256
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,150
Kong, there are torches down the mountain.

257
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,550
It should be the Kuomintang's reinforcements.

258
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,360
We should retreat now.

259
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,670
Young man, I'll go with you.

260
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,600
I'm good at making coins. I'll be useful to you.

261
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,120
Take him away.

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,650
Retreat!

263
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,150
Let's go.

264
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,480
Put out the fire!

265
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,270
Hurry up!

266
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,910
Sir!

267
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,480
Sir!

268
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,360
Sir!

269
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,290
How are you?

270
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,810
How are you?

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,730
Are you okay?

272
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,670
Sir,

273
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
who knows how many bombs are in there?

274
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,030
Let's retreat.

275
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,670
Sir!

276
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,530
Let's retreat.

277
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,120
Let's retreat.

278
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,720
Get up.

279
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,440
They took Mr. Shen away.

280
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,480
Now it seems

281
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,030
the Guangdong Army and Kuomintang aren't on the same side.

282
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,470
They are a bunch of scum,

283
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,240
trampling on the interests of the Kuomintang.

284
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,120
If it weren’t for Qian Fengshi...

285
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,750
Captain Lin!

286
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
We wouldn't have suffered so many losses today.

287
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:32,960
Lin Qiaosong

288
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I got it!

289
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
I have a solution.

290
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,960
Sir.

291
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,870
Sir.

292
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,670
Hello.

293
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,840
Sir,

294
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
I'm here to visit you.

295
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,720
Why?

296
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,120
To laugh at me?

297
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,200
No.

298
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,910
I want to take you to the bank.

299
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Don't think that you can change me.

300
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,790
I don't know if I can change you,

301
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,670
but I want you to know

302
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,670
what Jinzhen and I are committed to.

303
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,150
Slow down.

304
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,750
Brother.

305
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,240
This is for you.

306
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,960
Thank you.

307
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,390
Mom said we should thank you for teaching us how to notice counterfeit money,

308
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,270
so we weren't cheated.

309
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,600
Here.

310
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,670
You can keep this. I have more.

311
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,550
Are you also from the Red Army?

312
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,440
Yes.

313
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,000
Mom said everyone who protects us is from the Red Army.

314
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,150
I want to join the Red Army when I grow up.

315
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:39,320
Me too!

316
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,910
Sir, I know what you're thinking.

317
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,080
It won't be the end of the world

318
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,630
even if you seal off Sanjiang Kou.

319
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,910
We still have tungsten ore.

320
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,240
This is liquid capital.

321
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,610
Even without Sanjiang Kou,

322
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,030
we have other ways.

323
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,630
We want to buy government bonds.

324
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,360
Folks, don't push!

325
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,750
Don't push! Don't push!

326
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,030
There are sufficient government bonds.

327
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,390
Everyone can get their share.

328
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,120
Folks,

329
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,720
the Kuomintang wreaked havoc recently.

330
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,630
In order to protect the people,

331
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,240
the Red Army destroyed the Kuomintang's counterfeit money factory

332
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
and arrested the Special Commissioner.

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,730
Now that our bank is in trouble,

334
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,150
let's do whatever we can within our capabilities.

335
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,550
We were tricked by the spy

336
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,010
to exchange it at the bank.

337
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,550
Now, we understand.

338
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,880
We support the Red Army!

339
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,270
Support the Red Army! Defeat the Kuomintang!

340
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,720
Please line up in an orderly manner.

341
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,150
Come up one by one, okay?

342
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,630
Okay.

343
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't crowd together.

344
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,440
Okay, thank you.

345
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,030
Come on, take a step back.

346
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,480
Let's take a step back.

347
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,750
Line up orderly.

348
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,160
I don't understand.

349
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,910
They're already so poor.

350
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,600
Why are they still buying these government bonds

351
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,550
that have no hope of being redeemed?

352
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,410
Are they crazy?

353
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,390
The people also supported the Kuomintang before

354
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,000
and bought treasury bills to support the nation's construction.

355
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,320
The Kuomintang at the time

356
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
was also loved by the people.

357
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,390
Even the higher-ups said that the people's support was useful,

358
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,590
but what did the Nanjing government do?

359
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,320
So?

360
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,120
Are you sure the Communist Party is right?

361
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,910
Of course.

362
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
You once said

363
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,250
the foundation of finance

364
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,410
is credibility

365
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,270
and credibility is what we have the most of.

366
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,000
This was also built up

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,910
bit by bit by the Red Army

368
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,270
and Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank through actions

369
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,320
over the years.

370
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,840
The people's wishes are more important

371
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,150
than money.

372
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,120
I only understood

373
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,500
the true meaning of finances in Jiangxi Soviet.

374
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,550
This was Donggu Civilian Bank at first.

375
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,320
Later, it developed into Jiangxi Workers & Farmers Bank

376
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,440
After that,

377
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,240
it merged with Bank of Western Fujian

378
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,960
to establish

379
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,420
the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank.

380
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,960
I remember the content

381
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,760
of the report you gave me before.

382
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,670
You told me then

383
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,330
that the Communist Party was not a threat.

384
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,880
Someone asked me to write that.

385
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,030
He hoped to give Jiangxi Soviet some time to develop.

386
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,390
You already joined the Communist Party at that time?

387
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,200
No,

388
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
but I'd already given up on the Kuomintang.

389
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,080
We now have seven departments,

390
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
including the Operations Department

391
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,560
and Accounting Department.

392
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,240
It's small,

393
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,030
but it's well-equipped.

394
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,390
Everything is still in the grassroots stage.

395
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,480
Many parts are not perfect yet

396
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,920
and it's not as impressive as the Central Bank.

397
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,160
For a bank,

398
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,750
the most important thing is not whether it's impressive or not,

399
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,310
but the credibility

400
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,440
that you mentioned.

401
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,880
We have credibility.

402
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,680
Our main business

403
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,089
is to help farmers.

404
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,960
There are few big clients.

405
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,109
The clients are mainly local yeoman farmers.

406
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,640
Last year, we gave out loans

407
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,680
and provided seeds, cattle, and tools for our clients.

408
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,960
The autumn harvest in Jiangxi Soviet has increased

409
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,480
25% compared to last year.

410
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,680
If there's no siege this year,

411
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
the people of Jiangxi Soviet

412
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,610
will fully achieve post-tax self-sufficiency.

413
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,010
Do you know what makes me the happiest?

414
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,160
What?

415
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,440
Every day I come to work after the autumn harvest,

416
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,570
I can see items that the people gift us.

417
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,160
Sometimes, it's just a few eggs.

418
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,020
Sometimes, it's a basket of corn.

419
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,200
The villagers are not good at expressing themselves,

420
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,640
but they all know

421
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,480
who helped them have good lives.

422
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,920
They are all grateful.

423
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,050
This also makes me feel

424
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,680
that all our efforts

425
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,960
were not in vain.

426
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,440
Communist Party members?

427
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
When they see us,

428
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
they all have smiles in their eyes.

429
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,400
We are not blind.

430
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,960
We know who's good and who's not.

431
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,110
Brother.

432
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,480
This is for you.

433
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,550
Thank you.

434
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,310
I want to join the Red Army too!

435
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:36,640
Support the Red Army! Defeat the Kuomintang!

436
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,790
I asked you to come...

437
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,240
Chief Lei,

438
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,550
what is it?

439
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,730
The superiors have done research and decided

440
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,740
that Shen Tunan

441
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,400
will be executed.

442
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,820
It will be the day after tomorrow.

443
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,090
It's confirmed?

444
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,400
Deputy Chief Wei.

445
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,580
My last supper?

446
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,960
Tunan.

447
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,270
Jinzhen,

448
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,340
Yu and your sister-in-law

449
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
are at Ganzhou Hospital.

450
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,160
Find a way

451
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,210
to send them away from Ganzhou.

452
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
Help me tell your sister-in-law

453
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
that I'll repay what I owe her

454
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,400
in my next life.

455
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

456
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I promise you.

457
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,900
Where do you want to send them?

458
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,110
She wanted to go abroad.

459
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,400
If possible,

460
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
try your best to help her.

461
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,310
Don't worry.

462
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,480
Here.

463
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,830
Drink with me.

464
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,030
Ruolai,

465
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,850
when you were arrested

466
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,160
on accusations of colluding with communists in Shanghai,

467
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,750
I rescued you

468
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,200
despite the great pressure.

469
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,070
Yes, sir.

470
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,790
Without you,

471
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,270
I wouldn't have been released.

472
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,440
If you

473
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,480
remember this favor,

474
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,070
please

475
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,350
take good care of Jinzhen for me.

476
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,960
She's my only sister.

477
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,590
My parents passed away early.

478
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,450
I brought her up since childhood.

479
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,540
I spoiled her and doted on her.

480
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,590
That's why she has so many bad habits.

481
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,680
She is very willful.

482
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,480
In the future,

483
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,030
please tolerate her.

484
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,070
Okay, sir.

485
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,610
Take care of her.

486
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,480
Here.

487
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,730
Don't see me off tomorrow.

488
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,740
You don't have to collect my body either.

489
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:44,960
Sir—

490
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,820
When you think of me in the future,

491
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,450
I hope that the image you see

492
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,400
is of that mature, wise,

493
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,830
and responsible mentor.

494
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,660
You're not only my mentor,

495
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,530
but also an older brother.

496
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,790
Older brother.

497
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,440
I actually regret it.

498
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,370
I shouldn't have

499
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,570
given in at that time

500
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,230
and cared about the so-called big picture.

501
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,550
For the counterfeit coins and the treasury bills,

502
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,350
even if I'd fallen out with them,

503
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,750
I'd at most be dismissed from my position.

504
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,680
In that case,

505
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,240
I may have lost my career,

506
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,110
but my conscience

507
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,880
wouldn't hurt this much.

508
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,880
After I arrived in Ganzhou,

509
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
I often can't sleep at night.

510
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,000
I think of those rickshaw drivers who died in vain

511
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,200
and the people who went bankrupt due to the treasury bills

512
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,750
and wailed hopelessly on the streets.

513
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,920
When I think of all this,

514
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,550
Ruolai,

515
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,750
my heart...

516
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,110
Sir.

517
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,430
I thought you'd changed.

518
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,250
Fortunately, you didn't.

519
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,000
Ruolai,

520
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
I actually envy you.

521
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,680
For what?

522
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,850
As someone in the financial industry,

523
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,550
I also want to eat eggs and corn brought over

524
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,000
by the people.

525
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,550
I also want to be respected

526
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,920
and acknowledged by them,

527
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,550
and treated as someone

528
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,680
that they trust,

529
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,440
but I failed.

530
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,920
I failed.

531
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,960
Sir,

532
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
you just took the wrong side.

533
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,310
It's not your fault.

534
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,350
I'm fine.

535
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,350
Ruolai, you did many things

536
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,750
in Jiangxi Soviet's banks,

537
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,830
many concrete and good things,

538
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,360
especially for the people.

539
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,790
To be honest,

540
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm glad.

541
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,960
I'm proud of you.

542
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,030
In Jiangxi Soviet,

543
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,230
I saw the beginnings of a modern country

544
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,590
and the class integration

545
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,830
that all the past dynasties

546
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,000
couldn't achieve.

547
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,680
The street vendors that I saw

548
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,880
were all at ease

549
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,210
and had a sense of security.

550
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,170
It's obvious that they hadn't been exploited or plundered before.

551
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,550
There was also a kid

552
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,750
who was dressed in rags

553
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,920
and ran wildly while holding a pinwheel.

554
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,200
When I looked at him,

555
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,830
his eyes were so clear

556
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,440
and his smile was so bright.

557
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,400
He was so carefree.

558
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,720
It's great.

559
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,400
At that moment, I had to admit

560
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,270
that the Communist Party

561
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,680
has taken shape.

562
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,400
Compared to them,

563
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,400
the Kuomintang

564
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,920
has done too little for the people.

565
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,240
Too little.

566
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,960
All these years of endless plundering and exploiting

567
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,830
has hollowed out the foundation of the state.

568
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,640
I often feel that

569
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,550
I'm willing to contribute to the country,

570
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,640
but there's nothing I can do.

571
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,200
Tunan,

572
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,750
are you willing to stay

573
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,830
and work with us?

574
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,960
I can't do it. It's impossible.

575
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,400
I believe in the Three Principles of the People.

576
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,070
Even if this ship sinks,

577
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,070
I'll sink with it.

578
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,790
I'll fight until the end.

579
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,920
Otherwise, I'll be ashamed of myself toward the Kuomintang.

580
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,750
Sir,

581
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,640
the corrupted Kuomintang

582
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
is not worthy for you to contribute your life to.

583
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,550
Don't speak further.

584
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,920
Don't.

585
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,070
Ruolai,

586
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,200
you're smart,

587
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,720
ambitious, and have aspirations.

588
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,000
No matter what happens in the future,

589
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
remember your original intention.

590
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Don't be like me.

591
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,590
Only caring about wins or losses

592
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,030
will make you forget your true self.

593
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,790
Yuanbao,

594
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,910
what's wrong?

595
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,750
It suddenly started burning.

596
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,400
It suddenly started burning?

597
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,160
Yes.

598
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,410
Comrade.

599
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,450
Yuanbao,

600
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,360
after the fire is put out,

601
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,160
count which documents are damaged.

602
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,790
Okay, will do.

603
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,850
Don't fall behind.

604
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,440
Chief Lei.

605
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,720
Here.

606
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,830
What's wrong?

607
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,030
Shen Tunan escaped.

608
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,530
It's good that you're back.

609
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm back.

610
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,550
I'm back.

611
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,310
Mr. Shen,

612
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,790
I believe

613
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,240
you are a true patriot.

614
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,680
Otherwise, you wouldn't have given up

615
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,160
Europe's superior conditions and return to China to work.

616
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,200
The Three Principles of the People

617
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,440
once guided countless people with aspirations

618
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,920
to work tirelessly

619
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
for world harmony.

620
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,590
But now?

621
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,200
The philosophy is still there,

622
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,550
while the Kuomintang has changed.

623
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,920
Countless cruel facts

624
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,310
are right in front of you.

625
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,960
You know that they're a group

626
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,110
obsessed with power and wealth.

627
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,350
Why are you still so stubborn

628
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,680
and aid the evil?

629
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,590
I hope you can think carefully

630
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,960
about why you returned to China back then.

631
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,750
I hope you can figure out

632
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,680
what you should do

633
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,550
and whom you should work with

634
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,310
to truly realize

635
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,200
your original noble dream.

636
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,000
That day, I could feel

637
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,230
that he was touched inside.

638
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,360
I believe he should

639
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,960
have some changes this time.

640
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,830
I hope he won't do more bad things

641
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,630
after he returns.

642
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,080
I don't think he will.

643
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,880
He was quite moved after coming

644
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
to Jiangxi Soviet this time.

645
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,070
Let's not talk about him anymore.

646
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,530
Let me show you something.

647
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,300
Tungsten wire?

648
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,360
I made it myself.

649
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,710
I've tested it. The quality is good.

650
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,920
I thought

651
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,440
that since we can’t sell tungsten ore,

652
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,800
we can make tungsten wire.

653
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,030
It’ll be much easier to sell than the ore.

654
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,630
How are the production costs?

655
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,150
Mineral processing takes time and effort.

656
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,630
It'll take hundreds of people to build a factory.

657
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,280
The production process is not complicated.

658
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,150
The equipment

659
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,280
can be taken care of easily.

660
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,320
This is great.

661
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,800
If we turn

662
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,130
tungsten ore into wire,

663
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,590
into a civilian product,

664
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,190
then we can export it ourselves

665
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,550
and even export to the world.

666
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,080
We can’t be too optimistic.

667
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,960
The production of tungsten wire is limited.

668
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,000
If we can’t increase the production,

669
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
it'll be useless.

670
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,920
That's easy.

671
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,760
We just need to increase our production.

672
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,710
But

673
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,190
if we have tungsten wire,

674
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,190
we can negotiate with the Guangdong Army.

675
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,110
If they don't buy it,

676
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,550
we can export it ourselves.

677
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,210
We'll have the upper hand now.

678
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,190
Thank you for your confidence.

679
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,110
I need you to help me make a report

680
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,440
for the fund to recruit people.

681
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,110
I'll establish the production line as soon as possible.

682
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,360
Okay, no problem.

683
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,150
Don't be scared.

684
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,960
I'm here.

685
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,000
I had a scary dream.

686
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,070
I dreamed...

687
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,030
Dreamed...

688
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,480
Dreamed...

689
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,360
I'm scared.

690
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,110
Don't be scared.

691
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,880
Darling, I'm here.

692
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll always be

693
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,550
by Yu's side.

694
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,550
Yu,

695
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,480
why are you crying?

696
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,150
Mom, I'm scared.

697
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,070
Yu,

698
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,360
I'm Dad.

699
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,360
Tell him to leave.

700
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,150
Dad is a murderer.

701
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,710
I don't want to see him.

702
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,280
Tell him to leave.

703
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,070
Alright, stop crying.

704
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,670
I'll ask Dad to go.

705
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,880
Mom

706
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,370
will tell him to leave.

707
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,400
Take care of her.

708
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,360
Dad has left.

709
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,480
Don't be scared.

710
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,550
Don't be scared.

711
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,000
Sir.

712
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,550
I must take down Qian Fengshi within the month.

713
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,360
Yes.

714
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,800
Chief Lei,

715
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,480
this is the account of the Trade Bureau's procurement

716
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
of medicine and table salt.

717
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
Take a look.

718
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,630
How is it?

719
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,190
The bank is getting less and less income,

720
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,800
while we pay more and more silver coins

721
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,550
to buy scarce supplies

722
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,400
like salt and medicine.

723
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,440
At this rate,

724
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,280
we'll be hollowed out

725
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,000
without the Kuomintang making a single shot.

726
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,800
That's right.

727
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,960
Once the vault is empty,

728
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,920
the Soviet currency's credit will also collapse.

729
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,720
This will then cause inflation.

730
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,000
The Kuomintang...

731
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,440
Operation Cord Severance

732
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,240
really put Jiangxi Soviet's economy at a dead end.

733
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,800
To overcome it,

734
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,440
I'm afraid

735
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,370
we need to find a breakthrough with the tungsten ore.

736
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,190
I agree.

737
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,030
The lockdown of Sanjiang Kou

738
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,000
led the tungsten ore's black market to skyrocket.

739
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,440
The market is short of goods and we're short of money,

740
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,400
so I’m thinking

741
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,320
can we trade the tungsten ore

742
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,230
by using a futures contract?

743
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,550
Futures contract?

744
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,190
How?

745
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,400
We can use a voucher

746
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,670
at a lower price

747
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,760
to sell to the big and small tungsten ore merchants.

748
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,710
This way, we can have some cash.

749
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,230
After we break through Sanjiang Kou,

750
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,590
they can get the goods at an affordable price

751
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,480
and get some profits

752
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,010
using the time difference.

753
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,760
That's a great suggestion.

754
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll report it to the president as soon as possible.

755
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,590
Okay.

756
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,720
Wait, there is a problem.

757
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,990
If those tungsten ore merchants

758
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,960
are willing to trade

759
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
with a futures contract,

760
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,280
how can we make them trust

761
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,280
that in the near future,

762
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,230
they'll get the tungsten ore?

763
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,150
In other words,

764
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,110
how can we increase

765
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,440
their faith in us?

766
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,440
Their faith in us?

767
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,440
I think it comes from two points.

768
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,150
First,

769
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,760
we must break through Sanjiang Kou

770
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,280
and develop a new tungsten ore trade line.

771
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,760
Second,

772
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,000
we can revitalize some of the difficult

773
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,760
or abandoned mines.

774
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,110
This way, production will increase

775
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,320
and there'll be no problems with redeeming the vouchers.

776
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,580
I totally support you.

777
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,760
Go do it.

778
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,280
Okay.

779
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,280
Ming Da,

780
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,800
the effect of the economic blockade

781
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,840
will soon be shown in the battles.

782
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,030
Tunan,

783
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,400
the chairman of the Standing Committee asked me to remind you

784
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
that the root is still tungsten ore.

785
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,760
The international price of tungsten ore has increased by 30%.

786
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,190
The government's supply still can't keep up.

787
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,030
The Westerners also put a lot of pressure on us,

788
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,920
so you must not slack off.

789
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,880
Send me the report on the mine distributions and situations

790
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,230
of the Communist-controlled areas as soon as possible.

791
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,840
Understood.

792
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,030
We will do our best.

793
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,690
Don't worry about your matter

794
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,190
of getting taken to Jiangxi Soviet.

795
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,790
The higher-ups have already investigated it.

796
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
Yes,

797
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,690
I thank the chairman for his trust.

798
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,760
The transportation line has been sealed.

799
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,630
What we should do next

800
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,590
is to restrict the tungsten ore production.

801
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,650
Let’s work harder.

802
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,670
I've already made arrangements.

803
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,400
The explosives have been secretly transported into the common area.

804
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,000
They were removed from shells

805
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,930
and are more powerful than traditional explosives.

806
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,030
You want to blow up the mines?

807
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,480
How can I restrict the production without bombing the mine?

808
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,760
The mine in Pangu Mountain is the largest in Jiangxi Soviet.

809
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,030
If we blow it up,

810
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,590
they won't be able to produce ore for months.

811
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,550
That way,

812
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,400
the communists won't even be able to feed themselves.

813
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,280
Good job.

814
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,770
Thank you for your compliment, Special Commissioner.

815
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,680
It's Pangu Mountain.

816
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Oh no.

817
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,670
The mine exploded!

818
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,190
Hurry!

819
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,920
Rescue the people!

820
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,760
Hurry!

821
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,440
Rescue the people!

822
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:24,880
Hurry!

823
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,940
Rescue the people!

824
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,670
Recently, several mines in Jiangxi Soviet

825
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,590
have suffered damages of varying degrees.

826
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,590
The Kuomintang

827
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,800
is targeting our most critical points.

828
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,480
They just blocked off Sanjiang Kou

829
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
and bombed the mines now.

830
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,420
They're obviously targeting the tungsten ore.

831
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,280
Here.

832
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,800
Take it

833
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,590
for self-defense.

834
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,790
Thank you, Chief Lei.

835
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,670
These days,

836
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,110
Kong will strengthen his protection

837
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,640
of you and Instructor Shen.

838
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,440
You must be careful.

839
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,590
Okay.

840
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,190
Ming Da,

841
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,630
we are strictly executing

842
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,670
the chairman's order.

843
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,880
We cut off all trade dealings

844
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,670
of the Communist Jiangxi Soviet with the outside world.

845
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,360
Next,

846
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,190
we will continue the blockade of tungsten ore,

847
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,320
while also attacking something else,

848
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,230
which is

849
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,760
table salt.

850
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,490
The priority now is still salt.

851
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,230
One silver dollar can buy seven catties of salt in the Kuomintang-controlled area,

852
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,320
but in Jiangxi Soviet, it can only buy 0.73 catties.

853
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,000
The people say that salt is equal to 0.73 catties.

854
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,630
There are 4.35 million residents in Jiangxi Soviet.

855
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,070
They consume 75,000 kilograms of salt every month.

856
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,470
I calculated it roughly.

857
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,230
With the current salt reserve,

858
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,030
we can hold on for another month at most.

859
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,230
We must break through Sanjiang Kou

860
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,360
to open up the tungsten ore trade.

861
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,960
Only then can salt can enter.

862
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,360
But the point is

863
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,190
we sell tungsten ore

864
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,630
to merchants in Ganzhou.

865
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,480
Qian Fengshi

866
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,960
takes dry stock dividends from the merchants.

867
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,480
Only by getting Qian Fengshi on our side

868
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,880
can our salt come in

869
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,210
and tungsten ore go out.

870
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,110
Is Qian Fengshi reliable?

871
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,800
He's cowardly and views money as his life.

872
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,400
He won't be hard to deal with.

873
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,070
However,

874
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,190
it's dangerous in Ganzhou now.

875
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,960
It's too risky to enter now.

876
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,280
But if we wait until the salt is used up,

877
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,400
Jiangxi Soviet's crisis will be worse.

878
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,960
I'll go there myself.

879
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,760
Okay.

880
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,280
Bring comrade Jinzhen.

881
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,940
You worked together very well

882
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,280
in the last mission.

883
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,110
Okay.

884
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,150
Jinzhen came into the city?

885
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,480
Yes, Wei Ruolai too.

886
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,570
They must be looking for Qian Fengshi to buy salt.

887
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,710
Just do whatever you want.

888
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,280
You must get the evidence of Qian Fengshi colluding with communists,

889
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,800
but don't touch them

890
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,710
before they make the trade.

891
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,360
Just do it?

892
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,030
Yes.

893
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,430
What about Shen Jinzhen?

894
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
She's a communist first

895
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,000
and my sister second.

896
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,710
Then, I'm sorry.

897
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,880
Wait.

898
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,630
Let me remind you.

899
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,230
Jinzhen has strong anti-tracking abilities.

900
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,630
Be careful.

901
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,920
Don't let things backfire.

902
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,150
Special Commissioner, don't worry.

903
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,840
Since they are here for Qian Fengshi,

904
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,000
we just need to keep an eye on Qian.

905
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,480
Okay.
