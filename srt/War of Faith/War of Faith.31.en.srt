00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,840
Madam,

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,070
here are the clothes you were looking for.

4
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,030
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

5
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,789
Leave them here.

6
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,470
Okay.

7
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,230
What’s wrong? Why the long face?

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,000
The chairman personally took charge as commander-in-chief,

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
dispatched nearly 400,000 troops,

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,120
and even hired military advisors from Germany.

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,840
And yet, we lost to

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
the Red Army, which barely had guns.

13
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,680
I just don't understand.

14
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,190
Is the Red Army made of iron?

15
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,400
War is a matter of supplies

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
and logistics.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,030
The Communist Party only has southern Jiangxi.

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,960
What did they use to sustain

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,280
such a big war?

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,470
You're not them. No need to figure out their way of governance.

21
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,190
Besides,

22
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,850
our future is not here.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
Our roots are still here.

24
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,030
Look.

25
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,070
Our failure this time

26
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,120
gave the Red Army so many guns and ammunition.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,190
They even managed to expand their territory.

28
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,190
If this goes on,

29
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,240
the Communist Party will be a big threat to the Kuomintang.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,520
It's pointless for you to be angry.

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,750
It's their fault for losing.

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,910
It is their fault.

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,750
Eat more.

34
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,870
Jinzhen, look at that.

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,410
It's pretty.

36
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,150
Kong.

37
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,710
Kong.

38
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,960
I haven’t seen you for so long. Where did you go?

39
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,560
I went on a mission.

40
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,590
I just came back.

41
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,030
Mom wants to give you an egg.

42
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,310
Thank you.

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,280
Go home.

44
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,750
See you, Kong.

45
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,710
Bye, Ganzhe.

46
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,240
Comrade Kong Lingzheng, you forgot your discipline again.

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,470
We can't take anything from the civilians.

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,120
Kong

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,910
has been helping them a lot.

50
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,120
Come on, the bank president was so excited

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,840
to hear that you were coming.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,300
Let's go. I'll take you in.

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm not going in.

54
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,600
What's wrong, Ruolai?

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,250
Is something wrong?

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,270
I've sent you to the base.

57
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm going back first.

58
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,950
I...

59
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,520
Since I'm already home,

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,560
I should go see my father.

61
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,830
Let's go home.

62
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,830
Go home yourself.

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm not going.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,600
Ruolai.

65
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,270
Do you have any concerns?

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,560
If you have any requests or needs,

67
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,720
just tell me. I'll talk to them.

68
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm just disillusioned.

69
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,150
I thought I could achieve something with the Central Bank.

70
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,360
But all that work amounted to nothing.

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,270
Wen is dead, and Ms. Zhou is crazy.

72
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,270
I'm wanted now.

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,470
Even your brother...

74
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,480
I don't want

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,390
to get involved with finance ever again.

76
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,310
I'm going home.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Let's go home.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Stop right there!

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Come back.

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,480
Doggie!

81
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,630
Come back! Do you hear me?

82
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,120
Stop it!

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,070
Come back! You hear me?

84
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,310
We almost died to get here.

85
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,800
Chunmiao.

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,390
And you're leaving just like that?

87
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,190
Yuanbao, what happened?

88
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,720
Stay here yourself if you want. Let go of me.

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,950
People are fighting outside.

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,800
Go inside!

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,750
Don't be impulsive, Chunmiao.

92
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,350
Excuse me.

93
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,830
Stop, stop.

94
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,240
Go inside!

95
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,800
Stop.

96
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,390
What's going on?

97
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,830
Comrade Jinzhen.

98
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,950
Comrade Lei Ming.

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,630
Welcome back.

100
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,630
You must be tired.

101
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,510
Not at all.

102
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,310
Long time no see.

103
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,720
What's going on?

104
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,750
Ruolai, let me introduce him.

105
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,830
This is

106
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,120
the president of the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank,

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
comrade Lei Ming.

108
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
This is Wei Ruolai.

109
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,730
Wei Ruolai from the Central Bank?

110
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,920
Yes, that's him.

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
He just got here, but he wants to leave.

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
His wife refuses.

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,950
I'm not his wife.

114
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,950
It was a childhood engagement. We broke off the engagement long ago.

115
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,630
Why did you tie him up?

116
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,390
Chunmiao.

117
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,750
He'll run away if you untie him.

118
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,600
As you know, our bank

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,040
needs talents like Mr. Wei.

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
But only if

121
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,160
he is willing to join us.

122
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,160
We can't go against his will

123
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
and force him to work for us.

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,160
Right?

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,620
Come on.

126
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,830
Untie him.

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,510
Doggie is a coward.

128
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,440
He'll behave after you beat him up.

129
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,720
Does it hurt?

130
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,110
No.

131
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,120
It's nothing.

132
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,120
Mr. Wei, welcome.

133
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,850
It must have been a tiring trip.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,060
Since you're here,

135
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,190
come in and have a seat.

136
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,480
Let me introduce

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,750
the general situation of our bank to you.

138
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,390
No need.

139
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,670
I'm anxious to return right now.

140
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,120
I want to go home first.

141
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,920
Chunmiao.

142
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,750
Are you going back to your hometown?

143
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,190
Yes.

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,600
My brother was part of the Communist Party.

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,720
He died during a mission in Shanghai.

146
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,800
My father doesn't know yet.

147
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,040
I want to tell them first

148
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,680
and hold a funeral.

149
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
You're right.

150
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,310
The deceased comes first.

151
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,440
I'll leave you to it.

152
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,120
If you're still interested in us after that,

153
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,850
our door is open for you at any time.

154
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,120
Thank you.

155
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,160
I'll go with you.

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
Chief, we're letting him go just like that?

157
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,020
Don't we need him anymore?

158
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,310
Of course we do.

159
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,270
But we cannot force him to work for us.

160
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,200
I'll see him off.

161
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,190
Alright, back to work everyone.

162
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,000
Dismissed.

163
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,190
Ruolai.

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,750
It's okay.

166
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,630
We won't force you

167
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,000
to make a decision.

168
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,150
Let me see you off.

169
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,630
Okay.

170
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,810
Before Xu died,

171
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,720
he told me that

172
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,680
Jiangxi Soviet needed me.

173
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,270
He told me to achieve great things here.

174
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,310
So, I believe

175
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,630
the Communist Party will definitely

176
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,490
achieve greater heights one day.

177
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,830
But I have no confidence in myself.

178
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,550
Why?

179
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,490
You're a financial genius.

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,320
Although I don't know finance,

181
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,049
my brother always praised you.

182
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,080
But he also failed.

183
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,669
I used to think that

184
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,200
finance could contribute to the country.

185
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,120
But after going through so much,

186
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,130
I found out that I was wrong.

187
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,030
All the policies we enforced

188
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,080
were done with good intentions.

189
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,150
But in the end, they all reaped bad consequences.

190
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,600
I don't know whether it was because of Nanjing

191
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,670
or that I have

192
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,720
never understood what finance really is.

193
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,150
So,

194
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,790
you need time to reflect

195
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,450
and clear your mind.

196
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,790
Yes.

197
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,030
Before I do that,

198
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,360
I don't want to be involved in finance anymore.

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,690
I don't want to get more people in trouble.

200
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

201
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,200
Take your time.

202
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,960
No hurry.

203
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,000
When you figure it out,

204
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,370
we'll welcome you anytime.

205
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,750
Chunmiao.

206
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,480
I'll stop here.

207
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,320
Don't bully Doggie anymore.

208
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,510
Got it.

209
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,600
We're leaving.

210
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,910
Bye.

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Safe trip.

212
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,320
War is the continuation of politics.

213
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,200
The economy is the foundation of politics.

214
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,490
Now, the Communists are rampant.

215
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,130
The national army has failed many times.

216
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,530
The war is not at fault.

217
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,240
We must besiege the enemy and defeat them in the financial field

218
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,630
to give the Communists a thorough blow.

219
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,590
The most important part of economic encirclement

220
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,320
is to prevent resource importation

221
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,050
and tungsten ore exportation.

222
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,360
The gain of the tungsten ore trade

223
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,840
is the lifeline of the Communists.

224
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,120
Once cut off,

225
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,630
the economic lifeline of the Communists will be removed.

226
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,490
They will be trapped in internal and external diplomatic conflicts.

227
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,670
Why are you up?

228
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
What's wrong?

229
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,640
You still can't let it go?

230
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,790
It's just an essay about eliminating the communists.

231
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,450
I wanted to leave some closure

232
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,630
for myself before I go.

233
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,670
I used to think that men

234
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,910
should be ambitious

235
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,320
and do great things for the world.

236
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,670
But now, I'd rather you lower

237
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,120
your ambition.

238
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,530
Such that you would only care about

239
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,870
me and our family.

240
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,070
Cishu.

241
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,760
I understand and support

242
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,270
your idea.

243
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,390
Everything will go as planned. Don't worry.

244
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,660
Keep your promise.

245
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,480
Of course.

246
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,480
Uncle Jien!

247
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,650
That's your dad.

248
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Uncle Jien!

249
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,600
Dad!

250
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,120
Dad!

251
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,960
Uncle, it's me! Ruolai and I are back.

252
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,600
Dad!

253
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm back!

254
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,870
Ruolai!

255
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,820
Slow down, Dad.

256
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,150
No rush.

257
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,270
Be careful.

258
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,130
I'll catch you.

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,480
Slow down.

260
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,080
Ruolai!

261
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,670
Dad.

262
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,480
Ruolai.

263
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,960
Dad.

264
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,480
Is it really you, Ruolai?

265
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
Yes, it's me.

266
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,150
You're finally back.

267
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,390
I miss you so much.

268
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm back, Dad.

269
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Ruolai.

270
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,720
We're home.

271
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,720
Come on.

272
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,840
Take a rest.

273
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,670
Dad.

274
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
My brother.

275
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,090
What happened to your brother?

276
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,010
My brother was a communist.

277
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,390
He died during a mission in Shanghai.

278
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,360
How

279
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,150
did he die?

280
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,510
He was betrayed.

281
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,250
But I killed that person in the end

282
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,880
and avenged my brother.

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,360
You killed someone?

284
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,560
Not only did I kill someone,

285
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,010
but I was also wanted in Shanghai.

286
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,840
Dad.

287
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Don't worry, Dad.

288
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Now that I'm home, I'm staying here.

289
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,330
I won't go anywhere.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,270
Are you wanted

291
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,030
because of the murder?

292
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,030
No.

293
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,200
Nanjing government issued treasury bills

294
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,730
to scam the ordinary folks.

295
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,750
I exposed the secret.

296
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,150
Later, the Kuomintang wanted to shoot me dead.

297
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,200
During the execution,

298
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,810
the Communist Party saved me.

299
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
Ruolai.

300
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,870
In both matters,

301
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
you did nothing wrong.

302
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,320
Revenge

303
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,600
is only natural.

304
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,360
Standing up for the people

305
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,270
is what a man should do.

306
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,630
It seems that all these years,

307
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,650
your education was not for naught.

308
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,510
Dad.

309
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,720
Ruochuan...

310
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,200
Ruochuan...

311
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,960
Ruochuan...

312
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,030
Doggie.

313
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,220
You won't leave this time, right?

314
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,150
Yes.

315
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,200
What are you going to do?

316
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,030
I don't know yet.

317
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,750
But I don't think I'll be farming

318
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,960
with my father.

319
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Are you interested in being an accountant?

320
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,670
An accountant?

321
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,840
I have a friend who runs a shop.

322
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,720
He needs an accountant.

323
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,990
Let me think about it.

324
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
If you've made up your mind,

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,360
ask Chunmiao to tell me.

326
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll match you up.

327
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,820
How are things going between you and Doggie?

328
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,910
What do you mean?

329
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,150
Your relationship?

330
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,480
We

331
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,790
broke off the engagement.

332
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,080
Didn't his father tell you?

333
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,910
He did.

334
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,670
Doggie wrote a letter and wanted to break off the engagement.

335
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,270
His father disagreed.

336
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,670
Why not?

337
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,810
What era is it now? How can you arrange a marriage?

338
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,310
Look at you.

339
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,310
Where will you find

340
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,720
a good-looking and talented man like Doggie?

341
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,030
Jinggang Mountains.

342
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,550
What are you talking about?

343
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,400
Do you want to die?

344
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
All the able-bodied people in our village

345
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,200
are now in the Red Army.

346
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,720
Only you old fogys

347
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
are still living in the past.

348
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,200
I'll beat you up.

349
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Don't you dare!

350
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,310
If you dare to hit me,

351
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,240
when I become the Red Army,

352
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,030
I'll bring the army here.

353
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,069
How dare you bring the army here?

354
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,349
I'll beat you.

355
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,960
I'll beat you.

356
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,270
How dare you!

357
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,240
You unfilial child!

358
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Are you serious?

359
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
How dare you bring the army here!

360
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,830
Uncle Baishan.

361
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,820
Uncle Baishan.

362
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
Doggie.

363
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,400
I've made up my mind.

364
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm willing to be an accountant.

365
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,350
Okay.

366
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,960
I'll arrange it tomorrow.

367
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,270
Okay.

368
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,920
Come on.

369
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,550
Have a seat.

370
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,310
No need.

371
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,240
I don't need to.

372
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,550
Sit down.

373
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,790
Come, have a seat.

374
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,160
Chunmiao,

375
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,680
make another pot of tea.

376
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,310
I heard you were doing well in Shanghai.

377
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,480
Why did you come back to start over?

378
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,110
I was just getting by in Shanghai.

379
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't be modest.

380
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What getting by?

381
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
He was doing so well, even the daughter of

382
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,110
a rich family took an interest in him.

383
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,240
Niu Chunmiao.

384
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Why did you call me?

385
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm not talking nonsense.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,270
She brought him gifts

387
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,790
in the middle of the night.

388
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,550
That girl is very beautiful

389
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,110
and elegant.

390
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,680
She studied in Germany.

391
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,270
She's a senior engineer.

392
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,270
She can fire a gun,

393
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,160
she can drive,

394
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,510
and she can play

395
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,960
the piano.

396
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,310
She's rich too.

397
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,590
She even risked her life for him.

398
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,170
What are you talking about?

399
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,640
Is she telling the truth?

400
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,830
There is someone like that.

401
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
I see.

402
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,920
No wonder you wanted to break off the engagement.

403
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,880
Uncle Baishan, I didn’t...

404
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
Why did she risk her life to save you?

405
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,880
When I was at your house,

406
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,640
she tried to shoo me off with 50 silver dollars.

407
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,240
What 50 silver dollars?

408
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
You can ask her if you don't believe me.

409
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
She loves you so much.

410
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,480
Didn't you notice that her tone is softer

411
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,830
when she talks to you?

412
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,590
In comparison,

413
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,070
I'm ugly and poor.

414
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,750
I don't deserve you.

415
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,790
Doggie,

416
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,270
since you have a better choice,

417
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,000
we won't hold you up.

418
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,630
Chunmiao.

419
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,720
See the guest out.

420
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,270
Okay.

421
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,920
Go.

422
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,400
Uncle Baishan.

423
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,720
Go.

424
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,400
Let me explain.

425
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,260
Uncle Baishan.

426
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,400
I don’t deserve you.

427
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,030
Go find your Miss Shen.

428
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,030
Enough.

429
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,030
Ruolai.

430
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,720
Want to be my apprentice?

431
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Mentor Shen,

432
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
please accept my three bows.

433
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,960
You distorted the truth and slandered people.

434
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,490
Aren't you afraid of the dead looking for you?

435
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,680
I told you before, politics

436
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,590
is an art of compromise.

437
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,590
I don't want to compromise.

438
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,000
Even if I have to risk my life,

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,660
I will fight them to the death.

440
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,960
Sorry, Sir.

441
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm officially resigning.

442
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,970
Repeat your original intention.

443
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
Serve the country.

444
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,370
Say it again.

445
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,700
Serve the country!

446
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,750
Serve the country!

447
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,750
Carve these words

448
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,720
into your bones

449
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,110
and let them flow in your blood.

450
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,110
If you let me down,

451
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,880
I'll kick you out myself.

452
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,480
Yes.

453
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,000
Remember.

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,660
I remember.

455
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,960
Ruolai.

456
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Who are you?

457
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,920
I'm Fang Ling.

458
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
I was your neighbor when I was young.

459
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,720
Fang Ling.

460
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,070
You've grown so tall.

461
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,640
I've been running errands

462
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,790
in the shop.

463
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,550
Tell me if you need anything.

464
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,070
Okay.

465
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,880
I'll get back to work.

466
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,240
Go ahead.

467
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,110
Let me make some introduction.

468
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,680
This is

469
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,960
comrade Shen Jinzhen.

470
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,720
She's a talented student who's well-educated.

471
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,920
The organization sent her here.

472
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,240
Hello, fellow comrades.

473
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's give her a warm welcome.

474
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,440
Nice!

475
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,200
Now, for some announcements.

476
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,310
Comrade Shen Jinzhen

477
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,200
has been appointed as

478
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,590
the instructor of our Soviet Republic National Bank's

479
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,750
Special Company.

480
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,160
Attention!

481
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,830
She used to be a senior engineer

482
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,480
at the Shanghai Arsenal.

483
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,550
She took part in many operations in Shanghai.

484
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,830
She has both solid theoretical knowledge

485
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,110
and actual mission experience.

486
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,750
If you have any questions,

487
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,880
you can consult her.

488
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,480
I wouldn't call it a consultation.

489
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,940
We're just sharing ideas.

490
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,960
I just got here.

491
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,960
There are many things I don't know yet.

492
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,920
I'd appreciate your guidance.

493
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,550
Instructor Shen, you came from the arsenal.

494
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,110
You must be good at shooting.

495
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,920
Can you show us?

496
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,070
Yes!

497
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Wei.

498
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,310
Wei.

499
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,960
I just picked these from the tree.

500
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,550
Try them.

501
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Thank you.

502
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,830
It's good.

503
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,240
If you like it,

504
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,110
I'll pick them for you every day.

505
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,590
I'll pick them for you every day.

506
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,310
No need.

507
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,640
Just do your work.

508
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,300
I have nothing to do recently.

509
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,210
There are wars everywhere. Business is not good.

510
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,750
Well,

511
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,030
don't you study?

512
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,350
I have no money.

513
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,440
We still have a lot of debt.

514
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,850
How can I afford to pay for my tuition?

515
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,880
Can you read?

516
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,920
Sort of.

517
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,000
I studied the Three Characters Classic

518
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,400
and Di Zi Gui for a few days before.

519
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Recite it for me.

520
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,750
People are good in nature.

521
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,400
They have similar nature and learn from each other.

522
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,640
I forgot the rest.

523
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,720
It's okay.

524
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,240
How about this?

525
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll teach you when I have time.

526
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,750
I want to learn math.

527
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,350
Why?

528
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,000
This way, I can read accounts for my family.

529
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,480
This way, I can read accounts for my family.

530
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,280
I don't want my father to be cheated by the lenders.

531
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,360
To learn math, you need to start with addition and subtraction.

532
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,160
How about this?

533
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,640
I'll teach you after my meal, okay?

534
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,590
Okay.

535
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,550
Great.

536
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,590
Take your time.

537
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,960
Tell me what you want to eat.

538
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
I'll cook for you.

539
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,640
No need.

540
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,200
Go back to work.

541
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,920
Okay.

542
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
Perfect bullseye!

543
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,790
Instructor Shen!

544
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,720
That's amazing, Instructor Shen!

545
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,200
Following the logic, the next ones should be

546
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,590
two,

547
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,400
three,

548
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,600
and four.

549
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,590
The top ones are five,

550
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,000
six,

551
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,640
seven,

552
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,040
eight,

553
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,350
and nine.

554
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,030
Keep your leg muscles tight.

555
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,270
Waist.

556
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,140
Put more strength into it.

557
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,440
Take care.

558
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,480
Let's continue.

559
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,200
Is it eight if it's seven here?

560
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,600
Five plus three is eight.

561
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
This is five.

562
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,110
This is three.

563
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,000
You can easily disassemble and assemble it.

564
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,480
Steady.

565
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,350
Squat down.

566
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,470
Start all over again.

567
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,680
Plus four.

568
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,350
Plus four.

569
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,270
Four.

570
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,060
What are you doing?

571
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,830
Let go of me!

572
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,790
Wei! Wei!

573
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Let go of me!

574
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,240
Help!

575
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,880
She's still a child.

576
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,110
Let her go.

577
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,720
Who are you?

578
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm her neighbor.

579
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,960
I'm her creditor.

580
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,960
Her father couldn't repay his debt.

581
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
He can only use her to pay off the debt.

582
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,170
Let's go.

583
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,160
Wait.

584
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,510
How much does she owe you?

585
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,350
Can you afford it?

586
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,640
I borrowed 20 silver dollars.

587
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,960
In less than a year,

588
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,160
the interest is over 100 yuan.

589
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,240
You're scamming me.

590
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,830
Everything is stated on the loan receipt.

591
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,750
You shouldn't have borrowed it if you couldn't afford it.

592
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,950
With the thumbprint,

593
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,030
even if you take it to the Nanjing government,

594
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,000
you have to pay back the money.

595
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,590
Not a penny less.

596
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,270
Let's go.

597
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,790
Wait.

598
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,880
Don't take her, let's talk about this.

599
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,400
Get out of my way!

600
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,920
Let go of me!

601
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,350
Let's talk about this.

602
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,880
Let's go.

603
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,860
Don't take her.

604
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,270
Let's go.

605
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,070
Wei!

606
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,680
Go!

607
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,110
Wei, help!

608
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,030
Don't move!

609
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,440
Help!

610
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
I'll kill you if you move.

611
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,310
Let go of me!

612
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,310
Let go of me!

613
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,480
What's wrong?

614
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,430
You haven't eaten all night.

615
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,160
Who bullied you?

616
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,400
No one.

617
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,920
Do you miss Shanghai?

618
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,960
Not really.

619
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,970
Dad, don't worry. I really don't.

620
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,680
Dad,

621
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,830
how much money do we have?

622
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,390
Why do you ask?

623
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,270
I have a friend

624
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,310
who owes money.

625
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,640
I want to help her.

626
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,440
Who is it?

627
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,480
Fang Ling.

628
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Fang's family?

629
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,400
Don't bother.

630
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,830
He only has one daughter.

631
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,920
He's in poor health too.

632
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,200
If you lend her money,

633
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
you'll never get it back.

634
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,980
But she can calculate.

635
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,790
She could be an accountant in the future.

636
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,960
Who would want a female accountant?

637
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,750
I advise you.

638
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,730
You should stay out of this.

639
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,750
Dad.

640
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,000
It must be the Communist Party.

641
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
What a mess.

642
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,680
A mess?

643
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,240
All revolutionary soldiers must remember.

644
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,000
Begin singing.

645
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,790
All revolutionary soldiers must remember.

646
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,640
The Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention.

647
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,160
This is the Red Army.

648
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,480
I know.

649
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,140
I've met their leader before.

650
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentries.

651
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

652
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,830
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

653
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,400
Long live the Chinese Red Army!

654
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,270
Long live the Chinese Red Army!

655
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,680
Long live the Soviet Government!

656
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,550
Long live the Soviet Government!

657
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,680
Folks,

658
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,880
according to the economic policy of the Soviet Republic,

659
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,310
I hereby announce

660
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,550
the abolishment of

661
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,030
the economic system that ruthlessly exploits the working people.

662
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,400
We're canceling all verbal and written servitude

663
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
and usury contracts.

664
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,750
We're canceling the debts of farmers

665
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,880
and the urban poor to loan sharks.

666
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,920
To put it simply, folks,

667
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,110
all the money you owe

668
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,000
to the loan sharks

669
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,750
will no longer count.

670
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,240
Awesome!

671
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,680
Long live Soviet!

672
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,000
Long live the Red Army!

673
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,240
Long live the Communist Party!

674
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Folks,

675
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,720
these people on public trial

676
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,160
will be sentenced according to their crimes.

677
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,000
We will

678
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,480
jail and execute

679
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
them accordingly

680
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,340
to seek justice

681
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,400
for everyone here!

682
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Awesome!

683
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Wei, help!

684
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,000
Don't move!

685
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,710
I'll kill you if you move.

686
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,750
Where's Fang Ling?

687
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,010
Where did you sell her?

688
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,920
She's dead.

689
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,240
All of them

690
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,310
are worse than animals.

691
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,770
I'll seek justice for you.

692
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,070
Fang Ling's death

693
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,940
is the tragedy of this era.

694
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,640
If we don't change,

695
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,750
more people will end up like her.

696
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,610
Is this really what you want to see in your hometown?

697
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,680
Please give us a chance

698
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,270
and your hometown a chance.

699
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,030
Jiangxi Soviet needs your help to achieve greatness.

700
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,790
I believe you will soon know

701
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,680
only the Communist Party can save China.

702
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,960
We firmly believe

703
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,720
this country will rise to glory

704
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
under the leadership of the Communist Party.

705
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,550
We firmly believe

706
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,350
our future generations

707
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,000
will experience the glory of our great country.

708
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,880
We also believe

709
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,000
they will live in a happy, prosperous,

710
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,720
and confident society.

711
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,240
Every child will receive an education,

712
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,030
even the poorest folks can be fed and kept warm.

713
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,550
Everyone will be equal,

714
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,350
Everyone will have food on the table.

715
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,550
Farmers will no longer pay heavy taxes.

716
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,200
The workers can produce goods

717
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,110
sold in every corner of the world.

718
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,550
Chinese will be heard all over the world.

719
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,790
Foreigners will no longer look at us with disdain and ridicule,

720
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,040
but appreciation and admiration.

721
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,830
Dad,

722
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,590
I want to discuss something with you.

723
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,720
They need me.

724
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,030
The Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank

725
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,890
needs a financial talent like me.

726
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,030
And I can

727
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,670
realize my dreams and ambitions in Ruijin.

728
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,570
What changed your mind?

729
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,750
Fang Ling

730
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,480
was forced to death by a loan shark.

731
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,880
If this happened in Shanghai and Nanjing,

732
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,110
her death would become old news.

733
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,880
But today,

734
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,310
the Communist Party stood up for her.

735
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,400
This proved to me that the Communist Party

736
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,200
is on the same side as the people.

737
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,720
Ruolai.

738
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,630
Let me ask you.

739
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,430
Didn't you say

740
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,110
you don't want to have anything

741
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,680
to do with finance anymore?

742
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,160
That was in the past.

743
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,600
But now I understand.

744
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,200
Finance is a tool.

745
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,030
If you put it in the hands of bad people, it's a knife to kill.

746
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,350
In the hands of good people,

747
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,410
it's akin to a plow.

748
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,980
I'm going to Ruijin

749
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,060
and walk the path my brother took.

750
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,550
One must not seek personal benefits

751
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,440
but benefits

752
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,960
for the world.

753
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,720
All revolutionary soldiers must remember the

754
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,680
Three major disciplines and eight notes.

755
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,680
First, follow the command.

756
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,240
Take care.

757
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,680
Work hard.

758
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,250
Don't embarrass your father.

759
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,960
What a good young man.

760
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,200
Ruolai.

761
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:20,960
Dad.

762
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Don't worry.

763
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,350
Work hard.

764
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,110
I'm going, Dad.

765
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,000
Off you go.

766
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,590
Okay.

767
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,960
Come back early.

768
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,750
Work hard.

769
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,440
Off you go.

770
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,160
Be careful.

771
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,350
Got it.

772
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,200
Go back.

773
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,440
Go back.

774
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,810
Comrade Ruolai.

775
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Welcome.

776
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,000
Welcome to our Red Army.

777
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,640
Let me show you around.

778
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,960
Our Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank

779
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,720
was established in February 1932.

780
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,030
The first president

781
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,750
was comrade Mao Zemin.

782
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,960
Our Jiangxi Soviet's bank

783
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,440
started as the Donggu Civilian Bank.

784
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,760
Later, it gradually developed into

785
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,190
Jiangxi Workers & Farmers Bank.

786
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,480
Later...

787
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,590
Later, you merged with Western Fujian Industrial and Agricultural Bank

788
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,030
and became the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank.

789
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,150
I didn't expect you

790
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,949
to be so clear about our history.

791
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,070
Someone asked me to make a report once.

792
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,730
I read up on some information.

793
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,440
Was it Shen Tunan?

794
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,510
He's a genius.

795
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,330
Unfortunately, he chose the wrong side.

796
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,960
He is a firm believer in the

797
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,590
Three Principles of the People

798
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,190
and still blindly believes in the Kuomintang.

799
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,960
I really hope he can come to Jiangxi Soviet

800
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,620
and feel the atmosphere here.

801
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's hope so.

802
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,440
Ming Da.

803
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,880
Why are you here?

804
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,230
I came to see you on behalf of the chairman.

805
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,440
You look good.

806
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,230
It seems

807
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,920
you have completely recovered.

808
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,720
It's a blessing for Kuomintang.

809
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,490
Please come in.

810
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,690
Congratulations, Tunan.

811
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,880
The chairman has read your essay on

812
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,710
the strategic encircling and suppressing the economy of the Soviet zones.

813
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,510
He was exceptionally delighted

814
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,550
and completely approved

815
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,070
of your suggestion that

816
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,070
the first crucial step of encircling and suppressing

817
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,360
the soviet zone's economy is to sever

818
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,960
the Communist Party's tungsten ore trade.

819
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,760
So,

820
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,070
he would like to appoint you as a special commissioner

821
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,330
and send you to Jiangxi

822
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,550
to carry out

823
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,110
the economic "siege" strategy.

824
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,760
Ming Da.

825
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,280
I'll be honest with you.

826
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
I'm a sinner.

827
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,480
I just wrote that essay

828
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
to give myself some kind of closure.

829
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,480
Besides,

830
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,260
I want to take my family to England recently.

831
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,070
I can't do as you say.

832
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,030
This flat scepter belonged to Yu Qian,

833
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,090
a loyal minister of the Ming dynasty.

834
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,360
The chairman

835
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,360
asked me to give it to you.

836
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,900
The situation is chaotic.

837
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,070
The chairman knows

838
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,000
that some members are not only useless

839
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,960
but actively causing trouble.

840
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,490
But if we deal with them now,

841
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
the situation will be more chaotic.

842
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,610
If we don't deal with them,

843
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,320
it will hurt the loyal members.

844
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,670
The chairman knows I was wronged.

845
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,840
Not only that.

846
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,360
When you were injured and unconscious,

847
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,090
the chairman was heartbroken.

848
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,840
He sat alone in the flower terrace all night

849
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,320
and said this before going to bed,

850
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,480
"Yu Qian was hated by others for being upright.

851
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,960
As a ruler,

852
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,110
if I can't even protect such a loyal official,

853
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,840
my nation deserves to perish."

854
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,500
After that, he asked me to pass this flat scepter to you.

855
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,440
After the incident,

856
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,010
if it weren't for the chairman,

857
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,410
Kang Shaojie wouldn't have stopped there and then.

858
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,360
After all, your sister is part of the Communist Party.

859
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,550
For this fact alone,

860
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,960
your family could have met a terrible end.

861
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,190
You're right.

862
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,870
"Be truthful and sincere" is the Huangpu Military Academy's motto.

863
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,760
The chairman wrote it himself.

864
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,280
What does that mean?

865
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,880
He treats you as his disciple.

866
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,320
Tunan,

867
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,290
you should cherish the opportunity.

868
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,280
It's my fault.

869
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,340
Don't be like this.

870
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,300
Don't be like this, Cishu.

871
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,150
Don't be like this.

872
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,670
We have bought

873
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,810
the ferry tickets to England.

874
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,630
Yu has already

875
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,360
dropped out of school.

876
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,590
Don't tell me

877
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,530
you won't leave with us tomorrow.

878
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,150
Say something.

879
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,920
Nanjing is such a big place.

880
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,920
Are you the only capable man left?

881
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,320
The country is in danger.

882
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,190
The country is in danger.

883
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,830
I really can't leave.

884
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,150
You went to Germany with me.

885
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,960
Do you know why I went to Germany?

886
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,880
I went there to learn how to strengthen the country.

887
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,030
I, Shen Tunan,

888
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,550
am destined to

889
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,070
offer my life to my nation.

890
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,800
Do you understand?

891
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,960
Offer your life to your nation?

892
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
You want to offer your life to your nation.

893
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
But you are my nation!

894
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,590
What do you take Yu for?

895
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,070
What do you take me for?

896
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,760
Please.

897
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,920
I'm begging you...

898
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
Cishu.

899
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,920
Wait for me in Shanghai with Yu.

900
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,590
If I can't come back,

901
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,940
forget me as soon as possible.

902
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,630
Tunan, I'm begging you.

903
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,070
Please...
