[The Central Bank of China]

5
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,960
Official Ming is here.

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,000
Please sit down.

7
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,630
Wei Ruolai being suspected as a communist

8
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,750
is a big deal.

9
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,020
Whether it's for the Central Bank or the government's image

10
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,890
of financial reform,

11
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,670
it's a very bad influence.

12
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,250
The public discourse is still spreading.

13
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,390
In order to find out the truth,

14
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,940
the higher-ups hope

15
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,290
that the Central Bank's Department of Government Ethics,

16
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,950
the Garrison Command's Investigation and Arrest Unit,

17
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,770
and the independent third-party firearms expert

18
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,030
can form a special investigation team

19
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,490
to officially start the investigation.

20
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,610
Chairman Chiang can rest assured.

21
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,060
This case involves many parties

22
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,190
and has a bad nature.

23
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,630
The Shanghai Garrison Command

24
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,420
is united

25
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,160
and will do our best to handle it impartially.

26
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,200
The Central Bank will also cooperate with the investigation.

27
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,220
The third-party expert team will do our best to cooperate.

28
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,460
The Central Bank hopes all parties will take part

29
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,620
in all segments of the investigation,

30
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,900
understand each other,

31
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,700
and reach a consensus in the end.

32
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,790
Of course.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
Let's work together

34
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,250
to do something big.

35
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,220
Mr. Deng, you and Mr. Shen are close in private.

36
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,990
Is it necessary to avoid suspicion this time?

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,230
Captain Lin, don’t worry about it.

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,430
Mr. Song has already

39
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,180
set the tone for this case.

40
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,220
If it's the Central Bank's responsibility,

41
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,230
we won't deny it.

42
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,560
We will investigate, process, and kill as necessary.

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,620
We won't hold back.

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,630
If it's not the responsibility of the Central Bank,

45
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,360
we won't take the blame either,

46
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,200
lest someone use this case

47
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,570
for other purposes.

48
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,420
Alright.

49
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,870
Sit down.

50
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,420
Sit down.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,310
Everyone,

52
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,340
as

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,140
the team leader,

54
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,940
being objective and fair

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,140
is my only request.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,600
Chief Deng.

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,630
I look forward to working with you.

58
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,920
I look forward to working with you.

59
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,330
Jinzhen,

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,360
I've read all the files.

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,640
I sympathize with your brother,

62
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,390
but though you recommended me

63
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,480
to Mr. Deng Ze to join the team,

64
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,590
I will still make my judgment

65
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,810
based on facts.

66
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,130
Of course. I didn't recommend you

67
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,430
because of our friendship,

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,020
but because of your character and professionalism.

69
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,790
Thank you.

70
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,570
But I'm afraid my Chinese is not good enough.

71
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,430
Don't worry.

72
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,740
I will assist you in you rowkr

73
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,930
and be your translator.

74
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,970
Okay.

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm counting on you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

76
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,670
Who is that foreigner?

77
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,060
He's a firearms expert from the arsenal.

78
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,660
He's a German called Wilhem.

79
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,300
Miss Shen recommended him.

80
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,300
He's in charge of the gun appraisal and inference.

81
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,540
Can you handle him?

82
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,270
Mr. Kang,

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
he's Miss Shen's friend.

84
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,040
Is he a friend or...

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,210
Just a friend.

86
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,830
If they're not dating,

87
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,500
then there's a chance.

88
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,640
How about this?

89
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,260
Think of a way

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,540
to find his weakness.

91
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,420
Mr. Kang,

92
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,210
I'm afraid we'll alert them like this.

93
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,540
Just do it and we'll see.

94
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,070
If we can bribe him,

95
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,760
we'll have a higher chance of winning.

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,420
This time

97
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,630
is a fight between gods.

98
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,090
The one behind Mr. Yu goes without saying.

99
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,610
The one behind Shen Tunan

100
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,620
is not just Mr. Song.

101
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,380
Chairman Chiang is also paying attention.

102
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,220
If anything goes wrong,

103
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,590
we have to take all the blame ourselves.

104
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,910
Don't worry, Mr. Kang.

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,140
Wei Ruolai is a communist's relative.

106
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,660
This is already confirmed.

107
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,390
He admitted to the robbery too.

108
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,610
It's just a question of how far

109
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,430
we can drag Shen Tunan.

110
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,180
Keep an eye on him.

111
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,800
Nothing can happen

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,960
to Wei Ruolai during his detention.

113
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,020
Understood.

114
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,170
Go.

115
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,480
Sir,

116
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,130
this is the bullet

117
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,490
from Li Shengda's body.

118
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,770
I just took it from the lab.

119
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,410
Did anyone see?

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:04,940
No.

121
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,780
Are there any death row prisoners in prison?

122
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,290
Yes.

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,070
Give me one.

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,670
Keep it a secret.

125
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,310
Hurry up.

126
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,540
I...

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,290
After 18 years—

128
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,420
Friend,

129
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,960
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,770
The higher-ups are pressuring us.

131
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,610
We have no choice.

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,360
Reincarnate well

133
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,230
for your next life.

134
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,490
Be a human.

135
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,000
The evidence has been confirmed.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
Next,

137
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,290
move Wei Ruolai to a bigger cell

138
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,450
with more inmates.

139
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,980
Why?

140
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,670
Get to work.

141
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,320
Witty, not bad.

142
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,590
Brother, does it hurt?

143
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,470
This is your bed.

144
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,490
Another one?

145
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,790
Here comes a pretty boy.

146
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,850
He can still crawl.

147
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,100
He's up again.

148
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,970
Kid,

149
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,040
what are you in here for?

150
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,980
Murder.

151
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,060
Murder?

152
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,270
A murderer!

153
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,900
You're so thin and gangly

154
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,600
and you dare to kill someone?

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,720
Yeah, you pretty boy.

156
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,000
The prison rule here

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,130
is you massage my feet after coming in.

158
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,400
You only get a bed

159
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,900
if you massage nicely.

160
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,430
Come on.

161
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,190
Go.

162
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,900
Hurry up.

163
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,050
Go over there.

164
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,190
Do you not hear him?

165
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,000
Come.

166
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,830
Drag him over.

167
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,830
Go.

168
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:49,860
Massage.

169
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,270
Hurry up and massage him.

170
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Use your hand.

171
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,190
Hurry up.

172
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,690
Massage him.

173
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,190
Hurry up.

174
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,590
Hurry up.

175
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,130
Hurry up.

176
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,750
Come on.

177
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,590
Harder.

178
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,670
Brother, is it comfortable?

179
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,840
Good job.

180
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,030
Come closer.

181
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,110
Where are you from?

182
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,780
Ji'an, Jiangxi.

183
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,150
That's my hometown.

184
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,950
Ji'an, Jiangxi.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,700
Lower.

186
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,230
How old are you?

187
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
Twenty-three.

188
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,180
Are you married?

189
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,940
No.

190
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,410
Just like you.

191
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,710
Where did you work before?

192
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,170
The Central Bank.

193
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,000
The heavens are fair.

194
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,480
You could go anywhere,

195
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,070
but you just had to come to hell.

196
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,680
Beat him!

197
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,440
Hit!

198
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,210
Stop.

199
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,130
Stop.

200
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,610
You can hit me,

201
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,290
but there must be a reason.

202
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,010
What did I do wrong?

203
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,910
Being in the Central Bank is your mistake.

204
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,520
Yes.

205
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,890
You vampires

206
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,560
sucked away so much of my men's hard-earned money.

207
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,970
You manipulated stock prices.

208
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,150
I used my hard-earned money

209
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,070
to buy shares of the Imperial Bank and Xingxia.

210
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,900
In the end?

211
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,610
You made the Imperial Bank and Xingxia's stock

212
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,520
hit rock bottom

213
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,370
and I lost a fortune.

214
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,620
The stock market is risky.

215
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,260
The Central Bank

216
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,850
is a financial institution, not a welfare home.

217
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,290
How dare you talk back?

218
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,850
Beat him!

219
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,710
Your fault for being stubborn.

220
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,390
Stubborn!

221
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,710
Pretty boy.

222
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,940
Why didn't you do the surgery?

223
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,550
You said he'll be fine after a while.

224
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,350
Brain surgery

225
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,020
is very difficult.

226
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,940
Before the surgery,

227
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,070
we should confirm the location and size of the hematoma.

228
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,990
Two years ago,

229
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,930
a Portuguese doctor

230
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,390
invented a new technology

231
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,100
called cerebral angiography.

232
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,530
We just ordered the equipment.

233
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,730
It's still on the way.

234
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,900
I hate people who treat me like a fool.

235
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,590
I'm not.

236
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,590
I'm not.

237
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,030
Don't be nervous.

238
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,730
A surgeon can be transferred

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,910
to internal medicine after losing a finger.

240
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,370
Don't worry, Captain Lin.

241
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,390
I'll arrange the surgery as soon as possible.

242
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,300
When?

243
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,910
Immediately.

244
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,600
Thank you.

245
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,290
Work hard.

246
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,580
You don't deserve water.

247
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,130
Drink piss if you're thirsty.

248
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,170
Hungry?

249
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,790
I have lice here.

250
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,880
Here.

251
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
Here, try it.

252
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,240
Eat it.

253
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:05,830
Try it.

254
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,810
Try it.

255
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,140
Kid,

256
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,350
how much do you earn a month in the Central Bank.

257
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,990
Fifty.

258
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,870
Fifty?

259
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,130
Fifty?

260
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,880
Fifty.

261
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,500
Fifty.

262
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,160
Brother,

263
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,540
it'll take forever for us to make 50.

264
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,220
Fifty?

265
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,610
That's all my hard-earned money.

266
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,770
They suck my blood

267
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,140
to feed you insects.

268
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,220
If you lose at gambling,

269
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,030
would you blame the dealer?

270
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,650
I...

271
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,860
Brother,

272
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,660
stop beating him. If he dies,

273
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,470
our sentence will be increased.

274
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,660
This guy aids the evils.

275
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,590
He deserves to die.

276
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,210
Brother, he's a banker. It has nothing to do with him.

277
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,540
Yeah.

278
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,270
That's right.

279
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,800
Calm down.

280
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,040
You...

281
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,710
You all lost money in the stock market?

282
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,300
Not just money.

283
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,870
Like Erdan,

284
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,950
he listened to the Central Bank's Assistant Manager Liu

285
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,540
and mortgaged his ancestral house

286
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,470
to buy the Imperial Bank's shares.

287
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,030
He went bankrupt.

288
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,470
And Zhuang

289
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,960
just wanted to have a grand wedding,

290
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,190
so he bought Xingxia's stocks.

291
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,860
His wife ended up leaving him.

292
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,700
Witty...

293
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,230
His mom used her life savings

294
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,850
to buy Huaxin Bank's stock

295
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,780
so her son could buy a house.

296
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,670
His mom is dead now,

297
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,740
but the money is still in the stocks.

298
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,640
Do you think this is humane?

299
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,920
My mom died because of the bank.

300
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,950
That's our hard-earned money.

301
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,470
Trade stocks?

302
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,350
Look,

303
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,780
the poor get poorer

304
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,220
and the rich get richer.

305
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,090
You cheated our money.

306
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,660
Aren't you evil?

307
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,370
Don't you feel guilty?

308
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,630
Did you all go riot at the government

309
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,580
and steal from the stock exchange

310
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,780
a few days ago

311
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,780
and got arrested?

312
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,170
We had to

313
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,860
vent our anger.

314
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,760
If you lost money in the casino,

315
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,300
would you smash the casino too?

316
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,310
What are you talking about?

317
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,040
Brother.

318
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,550
What?

319
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,630
What are you doing?

320
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,880
Get over there.

321
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,710
Go back!

322
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,070
Take Wei Ruolai for interrogation.

323
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,710
Let's go.

324
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,819
The first formal interrogation starts now.

325
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,319
You just need to answer yes or no.

326
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,620
Wei Ruolai,

327
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,080
we have a witness who is a beggar.

328
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,400
He accused you

329
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,050
of throwing this watch into the trash can.

330
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,090
This watch belongs to Zhang Mingquan.

331
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,810
Do you admit that you took it from him?

332
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,890
Yes.

333
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,830
The watch and the gun were stolen together.

334
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,270
Did you take his gun

335
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,830
to assassinate Li Shengda?

336
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,010
These are two questions.

337
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,020
Can I answer them separately?

338
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,780
Yes.

339
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,530
Did you steal Zhang Mingquan's gun?

340
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,590
Yes.

341
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,680
Did you steal the gun to kill someone?

342
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,710
Yes,

343
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,290
but self-defense can also kill.

344
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,680
It wasn't to kill Li Shengda.

345
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,980
You don’t have to answer the question I didn’t ask.

346
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,340
You will ask.

347
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,590
After asking about Li Shengda,

348
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,830
you'll also ask if Mr. Shen was behind this.

349
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,850
I'll answer in advance.

350
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,420
No.

351
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,830
Do you want to die?

352
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,070
No.

353
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,680
Your brother died because Li Shengda turned on him.

354
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,800
Did you think of taking revenge?

355
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,280
Answer the question.

356
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,320
I thought about it,

357
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,950
but I didn't dare.

358
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,200
I don't even know how to shoot a gun.

359
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,380
You stole a gun, but you say you can't use it?

360
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,530
It's easy to prove if he can use a gun or not.

361
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,960
Is there a shooting range nearby?

362
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,620
Mr. Wilhem asked if there's a shooting range.

363
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,750
He wants to do a test.

364
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,290
I don't think it's necessary.

365
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,360
If you want to convict him,

366
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,760
you need sufficient proof from different angles.

367
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,710
Otherwise, it's hard to convince the public.

368
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
If you want to convict the criminal,

369
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,950
you have to show sufficient evidence from different angles.

370
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,480
Otherwise, it's hard to convince the public.

371
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,860
I think it's necessary too.

372
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,060
Guards!

373
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,690
Yes.

374
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,840
Take the prisoner to the shooting range.

375
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,460
Yes.

376
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,970
Wei Ruolai,

377
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,890
I know you can shoot a gun.

378
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,060
Your fingerprints were everywhere

379
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,720
on the gun found in your house.

380
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,190
You must have played a lot with it at home.

381
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,030
Shoot at the target.

382
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,630
Shoot!

383
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,230
Take him away.

384
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,100
Come out.

385
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,210
Sir, he got four hits.

386
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,390
He's good at shooting.

387
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,030
He hit four out of six times.

388
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,560
He can join Investigation and Arrest Unit after some training.

389
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,470
He held the gun incorrectly.

390
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,200
He almost dropped the gun the first time.

391
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,250
It means the chance of him knowing how to shoot is very low.

392
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,580
He might be pretending.

393
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,350
Ordinary people

394
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,830
will hold the gun tightly

395
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,400
due to nerves,

396
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,660
so the barrel will point downward

397
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,290
The bullets flew downward

398
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,480
and were close to missing the target.

399
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,710
The four shots all show the same effect.

400
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,960
What does that mean?

401
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,920
According to the case files,

402
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,580
Li Shengda was shot in the chest with one bullet.

403
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,240
If the suspect tried to kill him,

404
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,190
there's no way he'd have such accuracy.

405
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:59,250
He would shoot several times until the target fell down.

406
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,520
Judging from the observation results,

407
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,260
Wei Ruolai

408
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,380
is not a professional shooter, at the very least.

409
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,330
His performance

410
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,710
doesn’t match Li Shengda’s wound.

411
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,640
He’s good at pretending.

412
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,670
He tricked us.

413
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,960
I think we need to

414
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,360
visit the crime scene.

415
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,010
We want to go to the crime scene

416
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,000
and do some research.

417
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,040
There's no need for that.

418
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,770
Captain Lin,

419
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,470
what do you mean?

420
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,930
Do you want to

421
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,830
convict the suspect

422
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,130
without complete evidence chain?

423
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,270
Miss Shen, you are only

424
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,770
a simultaneous interpreter for this case.

425
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,250
But surveying the crime scene

426
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,180
was also Mr. Wilhem's suggestion.

427
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,210
Mr. Wilhem insists

428
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,770
that we go to the scene.

429
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Captain Lin,

430
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,360
I think

431
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,740
you'd better take us to the scene again.

432
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,560
Okay.

433
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,180
I'd like to see what other tricks you have.

Brother, how are the shoes?

436
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,420
Not bad.

437
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,510
I'll buy one pair if I have money.

438
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,610
I'll definitely buy one pair.

How is it?

443
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,630
The stock market fell.

444
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,880
It fell?

445
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:23,770
How...

446
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,430
How much did it fall?

447
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,080
They all fell.

448
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,810

Fortunately, it didn't rise or fall.

453
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,830
Not bad.

454
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,530
It's better than ours.

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I knew it.

Hengmei's most profitable business is in Southern Jiangxi.

468
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,080
So what?

469
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,680
Do you think the attack on communists in Jiangxi

470
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,280
can be done in one or two days?

471
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,190
Hengmei has business in Wuhan and Changsha too.

472
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,100
They're quite profitable.

473
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,090

Hello, sir.

488
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,640
You just said Hengmei's stock will fall, right?

489
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,670
It will be worthless.

490
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,270
Its bankruptcy

491
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,750

You are quite kind.

00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,370
You'd get in a bad mood after losing money

500
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,790
and take it out on me.

501
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,740
Well,

502
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,610
he's pretty smart.

503
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,110
He doesn't want to

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,770
get beaten.

505
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,010
Tell me then.

506
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,430
Which one will rise?

507
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,400
Yes.

508
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,090
Tell us

509
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,510
which one will increase?

510
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,900
Yes.

511
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,280
Tell us.

512
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,840
Sell Hengmei's stocks first.

513
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,970
It'll be too late if you don't sell now.

514
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,160
Didn't you say Hengmei is very capable?

515
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,140
Should we sell or not?

516
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,770
Isn't it doing well?

517
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,990
It's not going up or down.

518
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,590
I don't think we should sell.

519
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,400
How about this?

520
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,820
I'll give you five days.

521
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,530
You help me predict the rise of three stocks.

522
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,910
If everything is right,

523
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,600
it means you're capable

524
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,530
and I'll acknowledge you.

525
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,940
If you're wrong,

526
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,990
even if it's just one that's wrong,

527
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,250
then you're lying to me

528
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,390
and you should know the consequences.

529
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,040
You know?

530
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,950
The victim was shot in the left chest.

531
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,470
Pairing that with how he fell to the ground,

532
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,100
it means the killer shot from this angle.

533
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,560
The accurate shooting range of a pistol

534
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,260
won't exceed 15 meters,

535
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,910
so the possible shooting location

536
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,320
should be from here to there.

537
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,880
Look here.

538
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,890
There are footprints here.

539
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,990
If I remember correctly,

540
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,370
the suspect's shoe size is 43.

541
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,570
The killer's size is 38.

542
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,810
The footprints at the crime scene are size 38.

543
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,910
Wei Ruolai's size is 43.

544
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
It's been days.

545
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,570
Who knows whose footprints are these?

546
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,810
So, I need

547
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,630
the model of the gun that shot Li Shengda.

548
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,260
We need to further confirm

549
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,540
the model of the gun that shot Li Shengda.

550
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,130
We found the weapon.

551
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,940
It was at Wei Ruolai's house.

552
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,530
But there is no evidence yet

553
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,160
that the victim was killed by that gun,

554
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,880
right?

555
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,490
I need to see the deceased's forensic report.

556
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,970
Don't have it.

557
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,270
What about the photo of the body?

558
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
Don't have it either.

559
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,780
Could it be that

560
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,490
even the body was cremated?

561
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,080
Captain Lin.

562
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,280
The more evidence you provide,

563
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,140
the faster the investigation will be.

564
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,830
I will report to Nanjing about any actions

565
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,650
that get in the way of the investigation

566
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,290
and make a serious protest

567
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,760
and strict condemnation.

568
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,250
If you don't have the body or forensic report,

569
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,110
then you can't file a case.

570
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,100
Looks like

571
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,990
the investigation can't continue.

572
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,410
I will file a complaint to Director Mingda

573
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,540
of Chairman Chiang's Attendant's Office.

574
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,060
I found a bullet

575
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,260
on the victim.

576
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,630
That's enough.

577
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,570
Then everyone is satisfied.

578
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,460
Let's go back.

579
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:50,920
Leave.

580
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,770
Witty, get the newspaper.

581
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,210
Can he read?

582
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,040
Brother,

583
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,460
is he reliable?

584
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,010
Shut up.

585
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,660
How is it?

586
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,390
Paper and pen.

587
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,140
Anyone have paper?

588
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,900
Pen.

589
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,600
Yes.

590
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,340
Witty.

591
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:26,890
Coming.

592
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,970
Come, take a look for me.

593
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,030
What is he writing?

594
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,750
Daheng Flour,

595
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,180
Xinmin Textile,

596
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,790
and Pujiang Shipping?

597
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,340
No,

598
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,620
what lousy stocks are these?

599
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,990
They've never risen before.

600
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,760
I've invested in the Xinmin Textile for a year now

601
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,220
I haven't earned any money

602
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,950
That's right.

603
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,550
These three are rubbish.

604
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,730
Is he lying to us?

605
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,490
Let's see what he writes first.

606
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,100
It will rise in five days

607
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,830
and it'll double in two months.

608
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,850
Within five days?

609
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,440
Five days?

610
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,600
He must be kidding.

611
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,010
Go take a look.

612
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,390
Take a look.

613
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,490
Go and have a look.

614
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,080
Did it rise or fall?

615
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,190
It fell.

616
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,230
I knew he was unreliable.

617
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,860
Why should we trust him?

618
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,150
It's gone down for three days in a row.

619
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,950
Look at this one.

620
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,820
It fell so badly.

621
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,260
I said

622
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,910
it's almost seven silver dollars today.

623
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,620
It fell so much.

624
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,390
Brother, it plummeted.

625
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,150
It's dropped three days in a row.

626
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,590
Yeah.

627
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,940
This one fell too.

628
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,050
This one too.

629
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:56,900
Brother.

630
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,730
They all fell.

631
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,870
Look at the newspaper.

632
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,790
Pujiang Shipping encountered a typhoon.

633
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,610
All the ships are unable to leave the port.

634
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,370
Daheng Flour

635
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,470
had a fire

636
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,960
and production went down.

637
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,140
And that Xinmin Textile

638
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,800
encountered financial fraud

639
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,100
and a case has been filed.

640
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,710
The market maker is probably doing a whipsaw.

641
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,950
They first release bad news

642
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,280
to get rid of those who are not determined.

643
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,840
Do you still believe him?

644
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,630
Don't go.

645
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,470
Stop bragging. Are you trying to scam us?

646
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,690
Didn't I say five days?

647
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,920
It's only the fourth day.

648
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,050
Are you forgetful or can you not count?

649
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,870
Let go.

650
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,430
Brother!

651
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,190
Let go.

652
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,230
If it falls tomorrow, I'll shove you into the urine bucket.

653
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,590
If it rises tomorrow,

654
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,750
can you get me a better bed?

655
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,610
Jinzhen.

656
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,040
Tunan,

657
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,600
morning.

658
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,270
Any progress on Ruolai's case?

659
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,490
It's not going well.

660
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,900
Lin Qiaosong refuses to cooperate

661
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,870
and keeps passing the buck.

662
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,200
Is he mentally alright?

663
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,830
Yes.

664
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,680
Don't worry.

665
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,440
Normal people would have had a mental breakdown

666
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,520
after getting tortured like this.

667
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
If you have a chance, help me tell him—

668
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,860
I have no chance.

669
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,560
Everyone is watching.

670
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,420
Let me give you a ride.

671
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:07,960
No need.

672
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,320
Wang.

673
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,239
Here.

674
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,389
It's the fifth day.

675
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,420
I wish you good luck.

676
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,340
Thank you.

677
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,420
What does it say?

678
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,620
Did it go up or down?

679
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,230
Did it go up or down?

680
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,040
Speak up.

681
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:35,920
This...

682
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,670
Say it. What is this?

683
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,250
Say something.

684
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,580
Hurry up!

685
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,460
I'm so worried.

686
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,520
This...

687
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,080
Stop stuttering.

688
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,110
I knew it.

689
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,550
It went up!

690
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,730
Jiang, look.

691
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,670
these three are the only ones that rose so much.

692
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,590
We're rich!

693
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,370
Move!

694
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,469
We're rich.

695
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,909
Hey, bro.

696
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,389
Bro, you've got skills.

697
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,400
What should we do next?

698
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,530
Yes.

699
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,150
What should we do next?

700
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,790
Yeah.

701
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,190
You need a big basin to kill a pig.

702
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,360
Why not make money

703
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,170
off market makers if you can?

704
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,400
Right.

705
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,850
Wei, come here.

706
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,770
Come on.

707
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,910
Go away.

708
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,630
It hurts!

709
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:18,980
Move aside.

710
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,100
Come on.

711
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,410
Have a seat.

712
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,200
Sit down.

713
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,720
Be careful.

714
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,480
I announce

715
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,750
that from now on,

716
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,910
this spot will be Ruolai's.

717
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,970
Yes.

718
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,220
Have some water.

719
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,930
Bro,

720
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,420
you're really something.

721
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,070
I, Jiang Huhao, have never been impressed by anyone else.

722
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,620
We're brothers from now on.

723
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,780
Call me if you need anything.

724
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,130
Mr. Wilhem said

725
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,210
that the caliber of this bullet

726
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,280
is the same as this gun.

727
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,390
So Wei Ruolai is the murderer.

728
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,430
Everyone,

729
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,170
no objections, right?

730
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,590
Wait.

731
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,720
I have another cartridge case here.

732
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,290
It was found at the crime scene that day.

733
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,290
Miss Shen, there's no need

734
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,570
to make such a joke.

735
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,750
We were all there that day

736
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,710
and we found nothing.

737
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,360
Both Mr. Wilhem and Mr. Deng can testify.

738
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,120
I found a bullet

739
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,180
on the victim.

740
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
That's enough.

741
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,150
Let's go back.

742
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,000
Retreat.

743
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,490
Jinzhen,

744
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,820
what are you doing?

745
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,070
Look what I found.

746
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,730
A cartridge case.

747
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,920
What do you want to do?

748
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,610
Come.

749
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,250
Check the caliber of this cartridge case.

750
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,570
It's 7.65 mm.

751
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,510
How could this small caliber gun

752
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,040
shoot a bullet of such a large caliber?

753
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,590
Miss Shen,

754
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,710
that's a wild dock.

755
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
So much time has passed.

756
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,870
Anything could've happenned.

757
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,240
Maybe there was

758
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,500
another murder there

759
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,630
and someone else left it behind.

760
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,740
How can you be so sure

761
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,080
the cartridge case you found

762
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,370
was the bullet that shot Li Shengda?

763
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,630
When did Li Shengda get shot?

764
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,810
Ten days ago.

765
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
It's impossible

766
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,390
for the blood on this bullet

767
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,050
and the rust after oxidation to be like this now.

768
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,520
From my observation,

769
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
this bullet

770
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,250
is from at most five days ago.

771
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,120
Does it match with the gun

772
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,260
found in Wei Ruolai's home?

773
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:49,820
No.

774
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,600
Are there any death row prisoners in prison?

775
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,160
Yes.

776
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,880
Give me one.

777
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,210
Keep it a secret.

778
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,990
I strongly request a third-party forensic scientist to intervene in the investigation.

779
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,630
In addition,

780
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,190
I need to compare the blood on the bullet

781
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,680
with Li Shengda's blood.

782
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,910
Otherwise,

783
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,910
the evidence is invalid.

784
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,310
Captain Lin,

785
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,210
Chairman Chiang's Attendant's Office is watching.

786
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,420
How does the Investigation and Arrest Unit

787
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,580
dare to provide

788
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,720
falsified evidence?

789
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,520
Of course not.

790
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,030
Maybe there are too many items in the evidence room

791
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,730
and we took the wrong one.

792
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,130
I'll check it right away.

793
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,340
Captain Lin,

794
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,180
don’t take the wrong one again.

795
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,870
So,

796
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,200
the bullet that shot Li Shengda

797
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,660
was not shot from

798
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,990
Wei Ruolai's gun.

799
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,990
Captain Lin.

800
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,160
All the evidence shows

801
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,730
that the real murderer was someone else.

802
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,730
Wei Ruolai did take a gun,

803
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,010
but he didn't kill anyone.

804
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,220
I think

805
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,460
this case can be closed.

806
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,000
Wei Ruolai has nothing

807
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,400
to do with this case.

808
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,330
Let's go.

809
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,100
Miss Shen, please wait.

810
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,610
The truth of the case

811
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,490
has come to light now.

812
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,790
How about we make a deal?

813
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,050
I'll be implicated if Wei Ruolai ends up innocent.

814
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,510
I can bear the pressure from the higher-ups,

815
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,980
but with Mr. Shen...

816
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,580
Now you want to reconcile?

817
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,180
It's a bit late.

818
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,720
Wei Ruolai is still in prison.

819
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,070
If I go full out,

820
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,160
he won't come out alive.

821
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,590
What do you want?

822
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,450
I can guarantee Wei Ruolai's life,

823
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,860
but you have to promise me

824
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,910
that Mr. Shen won't make things difficult for me.

825
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,920
You think too much.

826
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,980
Even if we want to settle the score,

827
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,110
it won't be with you.

828
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,800
You're just a nobody.

829
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,900
Thank you for your hard work these days.

830
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,030
I'll buy you coffee.

831
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:11,770
Sure.

832
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,200
Miss Shen, this way.

833
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:13,990
Let's go.

834
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,310
What do you want to drink?

835
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,640
Can we only have coffee?

836
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,090
Sir,

837
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,410
you just let them go?

838
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
What else can I do?

839
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,880
Even Chairman Chiang is watching this case.

840
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,280
If something goes wrong,

841
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,110
Mr. Kang can blame it on me.

842
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,160
Who can I blame?

843
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,140
If we didn't give them the bullet,

844
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,510
they wouldn't find out,

845
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
even if it was falsified.

846
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,040
The cartridge case Shen Jinzhen found at the scene

847
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,780
can also match the bullet's caliber.

848
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,700
It may not be that bullet.

849
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,320
Li Shengda is lying in the hospital.

850
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,680
There are so many witnesses.

851
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,030
If we leak any information,

852
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,190
our whole team will be dismissed.

853
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,300
You can play with ordinary cases,

854
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,320
but this is a showdown between the higher-ups.

855
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,890
The tariff autonomy is behind this.

856
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,430
If you really piss them off,

857
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,890
they can smack you to death

858
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,640
with gold bars.

859
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,660
Wei.

860
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,740
Wei.

861
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,260
Come on.

862
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,620
Get up slowly.

863
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,870
Come, be careful.

864
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,960
Slow down, Wei.

865
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,780
Slow down.

866
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,470
Look.

867
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,450
I stretched these shoes out these past few days,

868
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,980
but you can still wear them.

869
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,370
The three stocks are still rising.

870
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,180
Right?

871
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:57,890
Yes.

872
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,260
Be careful.

873
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,270
It hurts.

874
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,560
From now on,

875
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,790
Ruolai will be like our brother.

876
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,350
Yes.

877
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,370
We will share

878
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,250
weal and woe.

879
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,540
If anyone dares to bully you in Shanghai,

880
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,270
give the word

881
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,900
and we'll all be there.

882
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,550
Anyone counts.

883
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,300
Yes.

884
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,090
Don't invest in stocks after you're released.

885
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,790
Why?

886
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,600
The stock market is still the game for capitalists.

887
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,080
If you don't want to lose too much,

888
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,180
avoid it if you can.

889
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,610
Maybe one day,

890
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,870
the government can really spend a lot of effort

891
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,530
to carry out a financial reform.

892
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,530
By then,

893
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,920
we will have a healthy stock market.

894
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,520
Then, it'll truly be an investment paradise for regular people.

895
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,770
Bro, we don’t understand

896
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,930
what you're saying,

897
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,960
but don't worry.

898
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,540
We'll listen to you.
