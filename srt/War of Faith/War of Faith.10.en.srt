[Episode 10]

4
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
Sir, the votes are out.

5
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,430
There were 129 votes in total.

6
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,360
54 votes were in favor.

7
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,789
39 votes were against it.

8
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,130
31 votes

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,560
were on the fence.

10
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,930
Not enough. It's far from enough.

11
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,750
There are

12
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,620
Yu Shiqing's people among the supporting votes.

13
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,030
They'll work against us at the last moment.

14
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,150
Those on the fence are as good as objections.

15
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,710
Recently, people come to us every day

16
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,770
in an attempt to affect our decision.

17
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,729
Sir.

18
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,900
Speak your mind.

19
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,670
I think they are up to no good.

20
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,300
We'll be affecting the profit

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,700
of these big compradors and foreign banks.

22
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,910
I'm afraid

23
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,780
they might harm you.

24
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,750
So what, you quit eating fish because it has bones?

25
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,480
Your car was blown up before.

26
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,700
So what?

27
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,220
I represent the Central Bank and Treasury Department this time.

28
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,800
Mr. Song and Chairman Chiang are supporting me.

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,130
Who dares to make a move under their watch?

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,700
Don't worry about me.

31
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,940
Focus on your work.

32
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,210
Go.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

34
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,760
What's the meaning of this?

35
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,270
Are you looking down on me?

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
No.

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,160
It's a bit embarrassing.

38
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,490
A few days ago,

39
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,710
someone robbed me at the New Show Club.

40
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,830
My pocket watch,

41
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,180
my wallet, and my gun.

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
They took everything.

43
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,650
Actually, everything else is fine.

44
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,050
But that pocket watch

45
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,910
was a gift from Mr. Yu.

46
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,650
I have to get it back no matter what.

47
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,870
You should

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,829
let the police handle this.

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,960
Asking us to help you catch a thief

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,730
is an overkill.

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,710
Mr. Kang, everyone knows that you're most resourceful.

52
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,910
How can the lackeys at the police station

53
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,829
compare to you?

54
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,990
A robbery case

55
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,510
isn't worth this much.

56
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,820
I must be sincere

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,410
since I'm asking for your help.

58
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,670
Fine.

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,930
Considering your sincerity,

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,340
I'll lend you my best man

61
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,790
from the Investigation and Arrest Unit

62
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,720
to help you find your pocket watch.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,480
I think Captain Lin is good.

64
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,270
Do you have something against him?

65
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,910
No.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,780
I've never seen him before.

67
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,980
But I've heard a lot of good things about

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,910
the people working for you.

69
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,779
Oh, you...

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,899
Guards!

71
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,459
Call Lin Qiaosong over.

72
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,540
Sir.

73
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,270
Come in.

74
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,710
Mr. Kang, you wanted to see me?

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,580
Qiaosong.

76
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,240
Mr. Zhang was robbed

77
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,290
at the New Show Club

78
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,140
and lost some things.

79
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,240
Help him find them.

80
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,820
Do you know the robber's identity?

81
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,810
Of course not.

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,790
Why else would I come to you?

83
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,700
The duty of the Investigation and Arrest Unit is to...

84
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,480
Find him.

85
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,860
Yes.

86
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Is it convenient for you now?

87
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,080
I want to know all the details of this case.

88
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
Here's the thing.

89
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,910
A few days ago,

90
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,090
I drank too much at the New Show Club.

91
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,660
Then I vomited in the bathroom stall.

92
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,350
Suddenly,

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,310
someone approached me from the side

94
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,230
and whacked me in the head

95
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,520
from the back.

96
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,960
I still have a bruise on the back of my head.

97
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,550
When I regained consciousness,

98
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,910
my pocket watch, my wallet,

99
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,260
and my gun were all gone.

100
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,700
When did this happen?

101
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,580
It was

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,180
on the day you drove to the club

103
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,490
to save Song Meijuan.

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,480
Qiaosong.

105
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,590
Mr. Zhang is a noble person.

106
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,360
He is a valuable friend to have.

107
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,490
I understand.

108
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,470
I will handle this case myself

109
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,390
and get the items back as soon as possible.

110
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,980
Okay.

111
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,790
Wait.

112
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,830
Captain Lin.

113
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,960
How do you plan to

114
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,380
find him?

115
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,380
Dispatch men to find him, of course.

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,010
We'll check the black market.

117
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,330
There are only a few shops that sell stolen goods.

118
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,590
Once we find anything,

119
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,800
we can follow the clues

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,860
and find the person

121
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,900
who robbed you.

122
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,010
I’ll wait for your good news.

123
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,960
If you can't solve the case,

124
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,170
I can only complain to Mr. Kang.

125
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,409
Mr. Chen.

126
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,830
Don't do this.

127
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,720
I can't let Guang down.

128
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,690
You can't do this.

129
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,440
Stop.

130
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,750
Too much.

131
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,350
Too much?

132
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,720
Your acting is too much.

133
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,220
Be more genuine.

134
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,370
Don't exaggerate.

135
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,120
Let's do it again.

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,450
Okay.

137
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,120
Okay?

138
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,700
Okay.

139
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,470
Okay, get ready.

140
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,350
Let's do it again.

141
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,990
Come on.

142
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,710
Ready.

143
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,430
Start.

144
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,470
Please.

145
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,600
Stop!

146
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,140
Newbie.

147
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,790
No, no, no!

148
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,980
No!

149
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,740
Think about it. You will be bullied soon.

150
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,590
If you encounter

151
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,190
something like this in real life,

152
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,010
would you be this calm and composed?

153
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,040
No, no, no!

154
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,300
Okay?

155
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,620
Let's do it again.

156
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,290
Okay. Come on.

157
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,090
One more time.

158
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,060
Ready.

159
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,230
Okay. Ready?

160
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,880
Start.

161
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,540
Mr. Chen.

162
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,750
No!

163
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,630
No!

164
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,420
Stop!

165
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,210
Who hired this woman?

166
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,230
Why is she copying me?

167
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,310
She even said "No!"

168
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,810
Is there no standard for acting nowadays?

169
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,409
Anyone can be an actress now?

170
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,010
Right?

171
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,110
When I was...

172
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,490
Here.

173
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,500
Go on.

174
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,580
No need.

175
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,980
Newbie.

176
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Come here.

177
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,640
Newbie, it's okay.

178
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
You did a good job.

179
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,480
You did very well.

180
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,559
May I know your surname?

181
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,720
My surname is Su.

182
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,559
It's an honor to work with you.

183
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,860
Good. You did a great job.

184
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,690
How did it go?

185
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,270
Did you pass the audition?

186
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,810
Yes.

187
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,190
Great!

188
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,710
I knew you could do it.

189
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,440
This director

190
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,740
came back from America.

191
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,540
He is talented

192
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,710
and aloof.

193
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,730
He doesn't listen to anyone.

194
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,750
If he chose you to be the leading actress,

195
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,630
that means you're talented.

196
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:06,960
Let's go.

197
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,980
Let's have some afternoon tea at my Western restaurant.

198
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,030
I shouldn't...

199
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,100
I just imported some caviar from the Black Sea.

200
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
You need to try it.

201
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,660
If you like it,

202
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,010
bring some home for Yu to eat with toast.

203
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,270
Let's go.

204
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,570
Mr. Yu.

205
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,010
The voting is tomorrow.

206
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you confident or not?

207
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
What's the rush?

208
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,810
So annoying.

209
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,690
Mr. Yu.

210
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,960
Shen Tunan has been busy lately.

211
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,270
He's canvassing everywhere.

212
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,690
Many old acquaintances

213
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,430
are taking his side.

214
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,840
Looking at history,

215
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,330
cruel officials like him will never meet a good end.

216
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,600
Just wait and see.

217
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,520
I don't know if Shen Tunan will live or die.

218
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,370
But if we lose another battle,

219
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,850
I'm dead for sure.

220
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,890
You're not any better.

221
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,050
How is the preparation

222
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,150
I asked you to do?

223
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,240
Everything is ready.

224
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,640
We just need your order

225
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,320
to execute it.

226
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,930
I have also arranged things with Mr. Kang.

227
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,440
If we leave any traces,

228
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,800
even if they won't help us,

229
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,490
they won't work against us.

230
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,170
Why did you go to him?

231
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,540
I know better than you

232
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,430
the kind of person Kang Shaojie is.

233
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,700
This kind of person is like a loach.

234
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,520
He's slippery and unreliable.

235
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,810
If anything happens,

236
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,530
he'll be the first to run away.

237
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,770
Seriously.

238
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,010
If it doesn't work, we can add more to the bargain.

239
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,320
There's nothing in this world

240
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,100
that cannot be solved with money.

241
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,380
Shen Tunan

242
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,270
is backed by Mr. Song.

243
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,370
But we also

244
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,350
have people backing us.

245
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,430
Let me think about it.

246
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,890
In business,

247
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,490
we'd better not provoke Nanjing

248
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,510
until we absolutely have to.

249
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,060
Come in.

250
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,150
Sir.

251
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,750
Your noodles with scallion oil.

252
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,610
Put it there.

253
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,190
Have you eaten?

254
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,570
Not yet.

255
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,130
I'll get a bowl of wonton at the canteen later.

256
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,400
The pork chop noodles at the small canteen are delicious.

257
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
You can try it.

258
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,750
Sir,

259
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,230
I'm not

260
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,360
qualified enough to eat there yet.

261
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,030
Do you think this arrangement

262
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,720
is good or bad for you?

263
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,740
I think it's good, Sir.

264
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,860
This way, I'll do my best

265
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,060
to earn the qualification to eat there.

266
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,230
So you see,

267
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,750
differentiation is not a bad thing.

268
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,670
The key is the path of progression.

269
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,870
A good society

270
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,780
must have a smooth

271
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,990
path of progression.

272
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,550
That way, we can give the people at the bottom

273
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,980
the chance to fight for the life they want

274
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,310
with their own efforts.

275
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,550
And we

276
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,870
are fighting for

277
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,540
a society like that.

278
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,570
Take a look.

279
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,430
The future is promising,

280
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,190
but getting there is difficult.

281
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,300
Judging from the numbers,

282
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,230
that is the case.

283
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,470
So,

284
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,680
we need to fight for the votes of the foreigners.

285
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,560
But...

286
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,790
I know what you want to say.

287
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,500
Foreigners are beneficiaries of the current tariff system.

288
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,580
They will definitely be a hindrance to the tariff change, right?

289
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,110
Yes.

290
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,520
Especially Yu Shiqing and Zhang Mingquan.

291
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,780
They will prove their value

292
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,150
to the foreign masters.

293
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,450
It doesn't matter.

294
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,030
Didn't I make some annotations

295
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,430
on the report you gave me?

296
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,430
What they care about

297
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,340
is profit.

298
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,910
Only when we share the same interests can we reach a consensus.

299
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,610
Of course,

300
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,540
the premise is their interest

301
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,440
must obey us unconditionally.

302
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,760
Come in.

303
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,390
Sir.

304
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,150
Say it.

305
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,750
Yu Shiqing called.

306
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,780
He said it was about the shareholders' meeting of the Xinya Department Store.

307
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,110
Do you want to answer it?

308
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,480
Answer it for me.

309
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,100
Tunan.

310
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,540
I know you're listening.

311
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,910
The major shareholders of Xinya Department Store

312
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,440
are waiting to welcome you.

313
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,150
Call me

314
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,700
when you are free.

315
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,830
Mr. Yu,

316
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,080
I'm really sorry.

317
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,790
Mr. Shen is not in the building right now.

318
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,320
I don't know where he is now.

319
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,460
He's trying to fool me.

320
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,820
Yu Shiqing is giving me the final notice.

321
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,790
Sir,

322
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,880
will he do something drastic out of desperation?

323
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,510
You two go out first.

324
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,600
Leave me alone.

325
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,680
Yes.

326
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,470
Yes.

327
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,890
Connect me to Astor House Hotel.

328
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,280
Since he's so stubborn,

329
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,750
do it.

330
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,630
Yes.

331
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,770
Wait.

332
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,140
You must do a clean job.

333
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,870
Don't leave any traces.

334
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,910
I understand.

335
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,360
Mr. Yu,

336
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,730
I’ll keep an eye on the entire operation.

337
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,390
I won't cause you any trouble.

338
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Yu.

339
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,710
Dad, you're back.

340
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,430
Let's eat.

341
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,200
It's so hard

342
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,270
to have dinner together

343
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,980
as a family now.

344
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,040
Where is your wife?

345
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,860
What is she busy with recently?

346
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,590
An audition.

347
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,380
Mom's going to film a movie.

348
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,830
A movie?

349
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,740
Why is she suddenly filming a movie?

350
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,760
Who asked her to do it?

351
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,890
Yu Shiqing's wife.

352
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,790
Yu Shiqing's wife?

353
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,730
Is this because of the tariff matter?

354
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,990
How did you know?

355
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,990
Who told you that?

356
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,000
Everyone in Shanghai knows it.

357
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,540
I didn't need anyone to tell me.

358
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,140
Those foreigners and compradors are going crazy.

359
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,750
This time,

360
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,030
Shanghai is in an uproar

361
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,340
because of you.

362
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,960
The German engineer of our factory said

363
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,960
if this proposal succeeds,

364
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,500
they will return to Germany immediately.

365
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,830
They won't cooperate with us anymore.

366
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,760
Let the Chinese enjoy themselves.

367
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,170
I think it's good.

368
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
What do you think?

369
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,420
As long as it's a good policy for our country,

370
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
I will support it.

371
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,310
You weren't this patriotic before.

372
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,070
When you were in Germany,

373
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,670
you were always with the foreigners,

374
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,000
drinking and chatting.

375
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,800
You thoroughly enjoyed yourself.

376
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,030
Don't say that.

377
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,990
That was just what you saw.

378
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,080
Can't I be popular?

379
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,820
Fine.

380
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,070
Anyway, if you

381
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,310
had spent all your time

382
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,530
studying instead,

383
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,010
China might have its own

384
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,210
big caliber high-speed cannons by now.

385
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,580
You're right.

386
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,540
If you had spent

387
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,940
all your beer-drinking time

388
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,870
in Germany studying instead,

389
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,070
our country might have

390
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,270
long achieved financial unification.

391
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,160
So quick-witted with your words.

392
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
I'm back.

393
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,720
You're back.

394
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,570
Mom, you're back.

395
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,450
Sorry, I'm late.

396
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,070
Sister-in-law, let's eat.

397
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,630
Okay.

398
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,890
Mrs. Yu wouldn't let me go.

399
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,800
She kept talking to me.

400
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,040
She's convinced

401
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,840
that I want to be a celebrity.

402
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,170
Those are all from them.

403
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,330
-I didn’t take anything expensive.
-Madam, please eat.

404
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:54,930
Thank you.

405
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,050
By the way,

406
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,390
there is a set of

407
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,030
handmade shampoo and body wash

408
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,540
from Italy.

409
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,880
There is only 1 such set in Shanghai.

410
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,800
Try it later.

411
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,010
So precious?

412
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,010
You dote on me the most, Sister-in-law.

413
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,270
Mom,

414
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,910
do you have a gift for me?

415
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,869
Of course.

416
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,910
I have one for your dad too.

417
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,069
Don't give it to him.

418
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,359
I don't want it either.

419
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,420
Really.

420
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,230
Give them all to me.

421
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,089
Take them all. They're all yours.

422
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,180
Big caliber high-speed cannons.

423
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,130
Financial unification.

424
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,359
Big caliber high-speed cannons.

425
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,450
Have you achieved financial unification?

426
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,380
Focus on eating.

427
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,620
Come in.

428
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,120
Brother.

429
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,890
What are you thinking?

430
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,830
Nothing.

431
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,200
Lend me a few minutes of your time.

432
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,780
Freshen up your mind.

433
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,310
Here.

434
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,190
What is it?

435
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,830
Get up.

436
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
This is the latest bulletproof vest

437
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,470
that I asked my classmates to send

438
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,910
from the United States.

439
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,660
Try it on.

440
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,070
For me?

441
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,250
This thing is quite heavy.

442
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,000
How can I meet people after wearing it?

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,810
I won't wear it.

444
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,740
Try it.

445
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,350
No.

446
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,550
You won't wear it?

447
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,400
Fine.

448
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,400
Sister-in-law.

449
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,570
You're so annoying.

450
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,650
Sister-in-law...

451
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,150
You should have cooperated from the start.

452
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,080
Don't rush.

453
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,670
Be careful.

454
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,510
It suits you.

455
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,790
Once I buckle it,

456
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,570
it gets so tight that I can't breathe.

457
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,720
It's very suffocating.

458
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,390
That doesn't matter.

459
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,320
What matters is that it's bulletproof.

460
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,590
Besides, you are so thin.

461
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,920
People can't tell that you're wearing it.

462
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,470
Fine, I'll wear it.

463
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,040
Alright.

464
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,550
You must wear it.

465
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,100
Yes.

466
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,880
It's quite heavy.

467
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,920
Alright, I'll carry it myself.

468
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,850
You must wear it.

469
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,400
I know.

470
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,380
Get some rest.

471
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,520
Don't work too hard.

472
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,340
Sleep early.

473
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,100
Stop thinking about it.

474
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,160
Good night.

475
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Good night.

476
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,570
You must wear it.

477
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,380
Thank you.

478
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,680
Bulletproof vest.

479
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,150
Considering what you told me,

480
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,110
should I still be in that movie?

481
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,470
Yes.

482
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,970
You have decided on it, haven't you?

483
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,690
Why give up?

484
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,030
But I have to remind you.

485
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,850
There's a chance this could go south.

486
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,110
It's hard to say if you'll be able to do it.

487
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,200
Because from tomorrow onwards,

488
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,810
they will hate me.

489
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,620
Will they kill you?

490
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,490
I'm a key official of the Central Bank.

491
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,690
I bet they dare not.

492
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,230
What if they jump the gun?

493
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,920
At least not to that extent.

494
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,160
In business, it's all about benefits.

495
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,330
There's no need for us to tear into each other.

496
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,210
I'll be okay.

497
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,390
Don't think too much. Go and sleep.

498
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,390
Do you want to

499
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,010
find an empty ground to shoot a few rounds,

500
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,010
and get familiar with the feel of it?

501
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:30,970
No need.

502
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,610
It's not our first time doing this.

503
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,790
Shen Tunan is a key government official.

504
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,650
He might wear a bulletproof vest.

505
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,430
Besides...

506
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,290
You don't trust me?

507
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,150
Do it yourself.

508
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,420
No, no, no.

509
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,610
No.

510
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,100
Come.

511
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,270
Let me show you the four roads

512
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,030
which Shen Tunan will definitely pass tomorrow.

513
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,900
One.

514
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,170
Two.

515
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,670
Three.

516
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,490
Four.

517
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,610
Send him to hell

518
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,080
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

519
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,190
My chest hurts.

520
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,070
It hurts so much.

521
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,060
My chest hurts.

522
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,300
Sir.

523
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,130
It's blocked.

524
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,610
They're coming.

525
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,410
Turn around.

526
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,190
Be careful.

527
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,210
Mr. Shen is not here yet.

528
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,470
Mr. Yu.

529
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,470
Hello.

530
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,510
Hello.

531
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,180
Where is Advisor Shen?

532
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,310
He should be here soon.

533
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,460
Advisor Shen is such a big shot.

534
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,250
He's the star of the show today.

535
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,950
Mr. Zhang, you are being funny.

536
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,070
He should be on his way.

537
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,310
Please have a seat.

538
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,410
Okay, let's go.

539
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:19,930
Please.

540
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,840
Everyone, please be quiet.

541
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,190
Today,

542
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,520
we'll vote democratically

543
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,200
on the proposal made by Mr. Shen Tunan of the Central Bank

544
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,150
to recover tariff autonomy,

545
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,190
by way of a secret ballot.

546
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,970
After repeated consultations with various envoys,

547
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,240
we have decided that

548
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,030
if more than half of the votes

549
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,910
are in favour,

550
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,000
this proposal will be approved.

551
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,930
Otherwise, it will not be passed.

552
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,260
We will vote at 9 a.m.

553
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,140
Before the vote,

554
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,540
[Shen Tunan]

555
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,120
Mr. Shen Tunan will speak.

556
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,650
Mr. Deng.

557
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,220
Mr. Shen is not here yet.

558
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't know either.

559
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,700
Sir,

560
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
are you wearing a bulletproof vest?

561
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,530
No.

562
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,400
I told you to wear it.

563
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,740
That thing is so thick

564
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,640
and puffy.

565
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,730
If I wear it, I am making a fool of myself.

566
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,730
Safety first.

567
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,220
Your life is more important than anything.

568
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,630
If he shoots you in the head,

569
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,860
is there any use for the bulletproof vest?

570
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,340
Well,

571
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,710
it's better than not wearing it.

572
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,150
I, Shen Tunan, am dedicated to our country.

573
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,720
If someone really wants to kill me,

574
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,040
I believe God will bless me.

575
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,190
Advisor Shen is the initiator of this vote.

576
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,660
How can we vote without him?

577
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,330
Yeah, how?

578
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,030
According to the procedures,

579
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,250
even if

580
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,940
Mr. Shen is not here,

581
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,590
the voting continues.

582
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,210
It's just that Mr. Shen's vote

583
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,140
will be considered an abstention.

584
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,300
All the representatives of Central Bank are late.

585
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,200
It shows that Central Bank

586
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,360
doesn't take this vote seriously at all.

587
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,320
That's right.

588
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,750
If so, how could we, HSBC,

589
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,680
trust them with

590
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
the tariff autonomy?

591
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,870
How can we hand it over?

592
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,620
No, we can't.

593
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,150
No.

594
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,140
We, foreign banks, have always been holding onto it.

595
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,770
Why should we hand it over?

596
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,170
How long have you guys been hogging this big piece of pie?

597
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,100
Who are you to not give it back to us?

598
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,350
Turn right.

599
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,810
Turn right on the path ahead.

600
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,430
Sir.

601
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,840
There's no way out.

602
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,910
What should we do?

603
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
Everyone, everyone.

604
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,100
Please be quiet.

605
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,610
Calm down.

606
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,230
Please calm down.

607
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,260
Mr. Shen must be on his way.

608
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,270
Please wait for a few minutes.

609
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,840
Are we still voting or not?

610
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,340
What time is it already?

611
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,300
Is this how the Central Bank works?

612
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,510
That's right.

613
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,390
Just cancel it.

614
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,070
Who are you to cancel it?

615
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,190
There are so many people here today.

616
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,470
This vote must go on.

617
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,590
Yes, we must vote!

618
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,290
What should we do?

619
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Chief Deng.

620
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,280
Mr. Jiang, looking at this situation,

621
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,710
why don't you go on stage and say something?

622
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,490
I've greeted everyone whom I needed to.

623
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,880
After all, I'm not from the Central Bank.

624
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,000
It's not justifiable,

625
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,460
nor does it make any sense.

626
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
What exactly is up

627
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,180
with Tunan?

628
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,430
Stop arguing.

629
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,630
Calm down! Calm down!

630
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,270
Stop arguing!

631
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,740
Calm down.

632
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,020
Please calm down.

633
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,110
Please listen to me.

634
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,920
Seeing how Advisor Shen has yet to arrive,

635
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,830
I believe

636
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,340
he must have been stuck in

637
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,520
a tricky situation.

638
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,430
Otherwise, he will definitely be present.

639
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,180
I believe

640
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,080
he must be rushing here right now.

641
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,330
So everybody, there's no need to be too harsh.

642
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,190
But I want to emphasize that

643
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,440
credibility

644
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,390
is the foundation of the banking industry.

645
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,950
The Central Bank has broke their promise to us.

646
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,780
It's like a mother beating her own child.

647
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,560
There's nothing left to say.

648
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,710
But I have to remind everyone that

649
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,300
those present today include

650
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,420
British, American, German, French envoys,

651
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,910
as well as representatives from

652
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,440
HSBC and Citibank.

653
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,420
We even have representatives from East India Bank.

654
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,190
If Central Bank breaks their promise,

655
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,790
how will they face all of these people in the future?

656
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,700
Yes.

657
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,120
That makes sense, right?

658
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,870
A hypocrite.

659
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,150
What a scoundrel.

660
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,870
This is a proposal guided by the Central Bank.

661
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,310
It's just a piece of paper

662
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,350
if it's not backed by credibility.

663
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,280
For the benefit of our country,

664
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,510
and for the benefit of our people,

665
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,470
I, Yu Shiqing,

666
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,110
sincerely asks everyone

667
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,640
to please start voting now.

668
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,870
In front of international friends,

669
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,140
we must protect the credibility of the Central Bank.

670
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,360
As citizens,

671
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,590
we can't afford to lose our dignity.

672
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,710
Mr. Yu is right.

673
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,970
It's embarrassing.

674
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,280
Everyone.

675
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,340
I hereby announce

676
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,990
the vote...

677
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,470
Wait.

678
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,020
Chief Deng.

679
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,070
Please wait a while more.

680
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,180
Everyone!

681
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,480
Shut up!

682
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,440
You're just an assistant. You have no right to speak.

683
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,570
Get off now.

684
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,820
Security, what are you waiting for?

685
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,410
I'm Mr. Shen's assistant.

686
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,500
Mr. Shen has said that

687
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,080
if he doesn't arrive in time,

688
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,880
I can give a speech on his behalf.

689
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,720
Chief Deng.

690
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,790
Chief Deng can testify for me.

691
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,490
Mr. Zhang, please calm down.

692
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,970
Assistant Wei Ruolai is right.

693
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,190
Mr. Shen did say that.

694
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,790
What did Mr. Shen tell you?

695
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,510
Please go ahead.

696
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,070
Okay.

697
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,050
Also, I want to remind

698
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,580
Mr. Zhang Mingquan of HSBC.

699
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,720
According to the rules of the meeting,

700
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,180
you have no right to speak.

701
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,960
You are the one who is truly disrupting the order of the meeting

702
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
with all that yelling and screaming.

703
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,280
Don't talk nonsense.

704
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,800
Don't put words in my mouth.

705
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,990
I'll say it again.

706
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,380
If you continue to disrupt the meeting,

707
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,950
you will be kicked out.

708
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,270
Alright, sit down.

709
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,060
Everybody, please do not forget that

710
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,260
today's stage belongs to Central Bank.

711
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,580
Didn't I annotate that report

712
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,140
you gave me?

713
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,260
These people care about nothing

714
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,160
but their own interests.

715
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,850
Only when we share the same interest can we reach a consensus.

716
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,790
If I remember correctly,

717
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,430
the number of people present today

718
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,650
should be 124.

719
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,260
But in my eyes,

720
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,650
what I see is our entire country's

721
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,020
450 million compatriots.

722
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,780
Then you must be blind.

723
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,570
Shut up.

724
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,420
Go on.

725
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,530
Is this tariff reform really

726
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,420
a zero-sum game between

727
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,050
domestic Chinese and foreign interests in China?

728
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,370
I don't think so.

729
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,260
Last year, as United States began the Great Depression,

730
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,390
capitalists would rather dump milk

731
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,350
into Mississippi River

732
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,550
than invest in more saturated markets.

733
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,610
In the earlier years,

734
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,910
Germany started a world war

735
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,310
just for a bigger market.

736
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,940
And in the even earlier years,

737
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,330
in order to open up the Chinese market,

738
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,210
the British started the Opium War.

739
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,610
What are these tugs of war between nations?

740
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,090
That's right.

741
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,310
It's all about fighting for the market.

742
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,390
So what can pull countries

743
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,180
out of the Great Depression?

744
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
It's also the market.

745
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,490
In today's world,

746
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,540
where is this said market

747
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,030
which can help resolve our economic crisis?

748
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,340
It's simple.

749
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,150
The market

750
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,000
is where the population is.

751
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,300
Now, there are

752
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,300
120 million people in the United States,

753
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,410
160 million people in the Soviet Union,

754
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,410
64 million people

755
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,220
in Germany,

756
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,520
64 million people in Japan,

757
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,490
41 million people in France,

758
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,380
and 46 million people in Britain.

759
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,780
The population of China is 450 million.

760
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,500
The 450 million citizens of China

761
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,960
will become the largest market in the world.

762
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,750
Our people are still currently poor.

763
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,410
Our country

764
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,590
is still suffering from war and hunger.

765
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,420
There are only a few million people participating in global trade.

766
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,140
However, the value of imports and exports

767
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,410
has reached 3,430.4 billion.

768
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,590
Think about it.

769
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,270
If we can establish

770
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,530
a stable and independent market,

771
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,900
Then how much will be the value of imports and exports

772
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
in the future?

773
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,070
It'll be immeasurable.

774
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,170
It'll be beyond your imagination.

775
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,530
You little bastard!

776
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,380
All you do is brag.

777
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,610
What does what you said

778
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,340
have to do with today's vote?

779
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,880
This is exactly what I want to say.

780
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,380
Taking back our tariff autonomy

781
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,320
will greatly alleviate China's debt crisis,

782
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,380
and strengthen the central government's financial resources.

783
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,490
This way, the government will have money and power

784
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,510
to gradually build

785
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,120
a more vibrant market.

786
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,190
A huge market of 450 million people.

787
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,790
Isn't that what everyone wants to see the most?

788
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,389
Dream on!

789
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,030
Shut up!

790
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,080
Let him finish.

791
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,610
You don't even act like an elder.

792
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,620
Mr. Yu,

793
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,620
You carry on.

794
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,150
To put it bluntly,

795
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,110
growing food requires water and fertilizer.

796
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,540
The best seeds

797
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,380
can't feed a man until it grows.

798
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,270
This tariff is like a mountain spring

799
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,330
and fertilizer to China.

800
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,690
The barren land you see,

801
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,480
as long as you give it time and patience,

802
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,830
I'm sure it will grow into an economic field

803
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,360
that can support the world.

804
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,070
There's an old Chinese saying,

805
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,270
"Ride the wind and overcome the waves."

806
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,790
I suggest our foreign friends here

807
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,510
take a longer-term view.

808
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,310
Christmas has just passed.

809
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,239
If you are willing to

810
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,139
return the tariff autonomy to China,

811
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,030
China will definitely give you

812
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,720
a belated Christmas present.

813
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,790
It will be a huge market filled with gold everywhere.

814
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,780
We don't have time

815
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,830
to listen to your nonsense.

816
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,500
If Shen Tunan doesn't arrive,

817
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,930
today's voting won't count.

818
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,340
Yes.

819
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,220
Without our support,

820
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,150
this piece of paper is completely worthless.

821
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,080
Mr. Yu.

822
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,650
Don't be so hasty.

823
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,980
What's going on?

824
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,620
Isn't Tunan here now?

825
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,160
What's wrong, Mr. Shen?

826
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:08,920
Sir.

827
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,550
I'm fine.

828
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,750
Sorry, everyone.

829
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,870
I, Tunan, am late.

830
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,000
Just now,

831
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,490
my assistant already gave a speech on my behalf.

832
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,150
I'm here to explain that

833
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,510
I'm late

834
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,580
not because Central Bank

835
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,600
do not take this proposal seriously,

836
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,800
nor do we not care about our reputation.

837
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,010
It's because there was an assassination attempt

838
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,450
on my way here.

839
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,670
At this critical moment,

840
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,740
anyone who wants to

841
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,350
kill me

842
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,880
knows what he is doing.

843
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,660
In my opinion,

844
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,660
taking back our tariff autonomy

845
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,120
is to take back the bloodline of the country.

846
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,620
I can bleed,

847
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,930
but the country

848
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,370
must bleed no more.

849
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,000
Here,

850
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,090
I would like to warn those with evil intentions.

851
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,960
If this proposal is approved,

852
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,310
I won't pursue this assassination.

853
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,070
But if this fails,

854
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,390
I'm sorry.

855
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,600
I'll get to the bottom of this,

856
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,510
find out who's behind this,

857
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,040
and punish him severely.

858
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,540
Everyone.

859
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,870
I, Tunan,

860
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,580
thank you.

861
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,280
Let's go to the hospital, Sir.

862
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,070
I haven't voted yet.

863
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,870
Give me the ballot.

864
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,780
Ballot?

865
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,250
Everyone,

866
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
I hereby announce

867
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,850
the voting

868
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,030
starts now.

869
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,280
I'm fine.

870
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,110
The votes are tallied.

871
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,800
The number of votes against the reform proposal is

872
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,560
42 votes.

873
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,520
There are 76 votes in favor.

874
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,450
There are 6 abstentions.

875
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,810
I declare that as of today,

876
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,510
Central Bank's proposal to take back tariff autonomy,

877
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,430
is successfully approved.

878
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,550

It must be them.

It must be them behind this.
