[War of Faith]

3
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,900
[Episode 4]

4
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you know what I'm doing?

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
Give a warning to intimidate the opponent.

6
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,930
Is the opponent intimidated?

7
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,870
Not yet.

8
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,030
Why do you say that?

9
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,100
If someone suddenly hit me

10
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,560
while I was walking down the street,

11
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,190
my subconscious reaction would be to ask,

12
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,310
"Who are you? Why did you hit me?"

13
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,080
Then I would see

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,310
whether I could defeat him or not.

15
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,080
If I could, I'd fight back.

16
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,630
If I couldn't,

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,190
then I might run away

18
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,920
or kneel down and beg for mercy.

19
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,230
Do you think he will run away

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,660
or will he kneel and beg for mercy?

21
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,390
It depends on the amount of capital.

22
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,370
If he doesn't think we have enough capital,

23
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,900
he'll continue to pester us

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,510
and fight until the end.

25
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,320
The amount of capital is only one aspect.

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,520
There is another more important factor

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,579
that you didn't consider.

28
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,930
What is it, sir?

29
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,570
Have you decided yet?

30
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,140
My patience

31
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,640
is limited.

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,960
Dream on!

33
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,310
Get lost!

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,520
Get out!

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,390
My friend,

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,040
to be honest, I'm helping you.

37
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,210
I know

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,390
you don't believe me now,

39
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,140
but you can think about

40
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,000
how arrogant you all were before.

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,080
Your strongholds were all over the country.

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,550
It's only been a few years.

43
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,550
How many are left?

44
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,820
It's like riding a boat.

45
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,750
You chose a sinking boat,

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,079
while I'm on the shore, trying to save you.

47
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,750
It's such a great favor.

48
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,510
Dying is easy.

49
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,190
What's harder than death

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,940
is when life is more painful than death.

51
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,460
Think about your woman.

52
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,840
Will she be sold to a brothel?

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,140
And your only son.

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,670
Can he live?

55
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,100
Will your family tree end here and no longer

56
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,610
have incense burning?

57
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,990
It depends on you.

58
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,950
Lin Qiaosong, you bastard!

59
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,120
Lonely Star.

60
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,020
Lonely Star.

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,180
Lonely Star will come to meet me.

62
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,070
You look

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,060
very sensible now.

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,140
Wait.

65
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,990
Answer it.

66
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,250
Hello?

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,450
Hello.

68
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,800
My surname is Yu.

69
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,150
Tell Shen Tunan to answer the phone.

70
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,560
Mr. Yu, wait a moment.

71
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,060
Mr. Yu,

72
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,950
what can I do

73
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,850
for you?

74
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,540
Consultant Shen, did you have fun

75
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,420
with this battle?

76
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,870
I embarrassed myself with my small tricks before you.

77
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,260
If you are short of money,

78
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,870
I do have a suggestion.

79
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,940
You can use the Central Bank's building as mortgage.

80
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,350
At my place,

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,100
we give loans fast and with low interest.

82
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,140
Mr. Yu, it’s no fun if you're going to bluff.

83
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,190
Gao Feng may confess anytime.

84
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,240
I'm not sure

85
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,840
what he will say at that time.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,060
But let me tell you.

87
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,720
I will choose which of his words to believe.

88
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,990
Consultant Shen,

89
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,790
I've seen

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,490
your army.

91
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,500
Next,

92
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,150
let's use diplomacy.

93
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,950
You are the second major shareholder of the Imperial Bank of China.

94
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,070
I promise you

95
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,150
that after the Central Bank controls the Imperial Bank,

96
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,730
your interests in the Imperial Bank will remain the same.

97
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,780
You also said this to

98
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,390
the other five major shareholders, right?

99
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,150
Why should I believe you?

100
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,610
You don't have to believe me.

101
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,150
Just go to Nanjing and ask around.

102
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,070
You have many connections and a high seniority.

103
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,830
See if you can

104
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,760
push down the matter with Gao Feng.

105
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,270
Consultant Shen,

106
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,110
how about this?

107
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,430
If Gao Feng frames me on purpose,

108
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,710
I hope you can

109
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,560
mediate the situation.

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,550
Of course.

111
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,550
I won’t hurt our friendship, Mr. Yu.

112
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,210
Okay.

113
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,550
Deal.

114
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,790
Mr. Liu.

115
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,390
Sir.

116
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,650
Retract all the funds.

117
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,560
Steadily buy Imperial Bank shares under 14.7 yuan.

118
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,390
No one can protect Zhang Mingquan this time.

119
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,940
Yes.

120
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,550
What are you thinking about?

121
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,150
Sir,

122
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,950
I suddenly understood a principle.

123
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,710
Tell me.

124
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,420
It's off-board moves that determine wins and losses.

125
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,180
Mr. Yu took a step back

126
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,580
because he has a disadvantage

127
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,070
and can't survive a beating.

128
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,150
When two armies fight, you either live or die.

129
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,470
Resources are important,

130
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,730
but more importantly,

131
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,270
don't let the enemy find your weakness.

132
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,090
I see, sir.

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,480
They will definitely see it.

134
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,170
Actually,

135
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,110
before I left,

136
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,070
I still had a chance to kill two more.

137
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,970
It was only a few seconds' difference!

138
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,440
It was too dangerous.

139
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,950
Lin Qiaosong is so familiar with you.

140
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,880
He can recognize you from the back.

141
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,470
Why are you so serious?

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,910
Don't be nervous.

143
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,820
If he discovers me,

144
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,050
I'll kill him with one bullet.

145
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,710
Eight other comrades are locked

146
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,490
in the French Concession's police station.

147
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,410
If the bail isn't paid on time,

148
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,070
the police station will transfer them to

149
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,400
the Shanghai Garrison Command.

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,170
At that time,

151
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,710
no one will survive.

152
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,010
The bail is 5,000 silver dollars per person.

153
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,270
A comrade has transported the fund

154
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,200
to Shanghai via the secret transportation line.

155
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,970
His codename is Lonely Star.

156
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,940
You need to contact him.

157
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,710
Lonely Star?

158
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,020
Wang! Wang!

159
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,470
He's still buying.

160
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,710
Soon,

161
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,440
the Imperial Bank won't be mine anymore.

162
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
I want to help you too,

163
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,230
but you know my situation.

164
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,720
I have no money either.

165
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,710
You have money.

166
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,310
I know you have many good friends.

167
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,390
Tell them help me.

168
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,670
-We’ve been good friends for so many years.
-Let me answer the phone.

169
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,670
I know you have money.

170
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,030
We've been good friends for so many years. Please help me,

171
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,840
okay?

172
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,560
Mr. Yu.

173
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,210
Mr. Yu.

174
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,110
Let me talk.

175
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,250
Mr. Yu,

176
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,480
please help me.

177
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,020
I've been with you for so many years.

178
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,750
I've helped you

179
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,270
do many things, both overtly and covertly.

180
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,710
You can’t abandon me

181
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,990
at this time.

182
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,790
Mr. Yu.

183
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,710
Mingquan,

184
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,670
listen to me.

185
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,070
Just admit defeat this time.

186
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,750
Maybe it's a good choice for the Imperial Bank

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,910
to be in Shen Tunan's hands.

188
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,260
Take it easy.

189
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,230
Mr. Shen.

190
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,480
Mr. Shen.

191
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,950
Up to now,

192
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,350
Kunpeng Industrial and its related accounts

193
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,870
have a total of 51%

194
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,070
of the Imperial Bank of China's shares.

195
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,550
The battle is over.

196
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,150
Thank everyone for me. You've all worked hard.

197
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,150
Thank you, sir.

198
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,780
Ruolai.

199
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,730
Sir.

200
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,630
Review today's battle.

201
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,390
Yes.

202
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,670
Your goal was the Imperial Bank, the main battlefield.

203
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,950
Everyone was watching it,

204
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,710
so you unexpectedly changed the route to attack

205
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,270
Xingxia,

206
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,950
Xinhe,

207
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,510
and Jinlong,

208
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,790
selling short without warning.

209
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,790
These are Mr. Yu’s major businesses.

210
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,510
He had no choice but to transfer money back

211
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,270
to protect himself.

212
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,390
After that, he didn't dare to support the Imperial Bank anymore.

213
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,390
Then you transferred your capital back

214
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,830
to attack the Imperial Bank.

215
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,830
You bought in large volumes

216
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,290
until you got the control.

217
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,310
If it were you,

218
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,530
what would you do?

219
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,070
If it were me...

220
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,550
I might use the newspaper

221
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,810
to make some fake news.

222
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,350
What fake news?

223
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,510
For example, a private bank manager with a gangster background

224
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,820
embezzled a huge amount of money and lost all his stocks,

225
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,620
causing the bank to go bankrupt.

226
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,150
You want to use public opinion

227
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,270
to create a crisis for Xingxia Bank?

228
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,870
Yes.

229
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,030
It wouldn't take long.

230
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,070
By the time they recovered,

231
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,390
the war would be over.

232
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,550
No matter how much money they had,

233
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,550
it'd be useless.

234
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,950
You need to fight fairly and squarely.

235
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,380
How can you kick them in the crotch right at the beginning?

236
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,430
But you kicked too.

237
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,030
Me?

238
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,230
When did I do that?

239
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,510
The case with Deputy Director Gao.

240
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,430
That's different.

241
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,100
What I investigated was all real and could see the light.

242
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,040
Look at you.

243
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,500
Fake news?

244
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,120
Look how clever you are.

245
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,830
The market is closed.

246
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,550
Let's go out for some fresh air.

247
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,160
Yes.

248
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,370
Shen Tunan,

249
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,590
karma will get you.

250
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,150
What are you doing?

251
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,750
Ruolai, don't get physical.

252
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,940
It's fine.

253
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,620
Okay.

254
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,710
Shen,

255
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,790
don't you feel guilty?

256
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,120
The Central Bank wants to coexist and mutually benefit with private banks.

257
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,410
Didn't you say that yourself?

258
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,290
I did.

259
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,510
But this pertains to

260
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,110
private banks that follow the law,

261
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,910
not you.

262
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Mingquan,

263
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,200
at this point,

264
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,710
shouldn't you reflect on yourself?

265
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,610
You're the one who should reflect.

266
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,170
You have power and guns now.

267
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,460
You're just a dog with a powerful master.

268
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,070
I'd like to see how long you can be arrogant for.

269
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,510
How long I can be arrogant for

270
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,710
is none of your business.

271
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,970
Worry about yourself.

272
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,830
If Gao Feng speaks irresponsibly,

273
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,890
how are you going to get through this?

274
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,670
I know you're not convinced.

275
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,070
Instead of drinking so much at night,

276
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,500
go read some history books.

277
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,360
In Western Han,

278
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,130
there was someone named Deng Tong.

279
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,060
You should thank me for my kindness

280
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,310
after you learn about what happened to him.

281
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,070
At least you can still live comfortably.

282
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,810
Goodbye.

283
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,950
Lowly yet proud.

284
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,940
[Rixin Bookstore]

285
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,670
Boss.

286
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,670
Sir,

287
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,270
we're closed.

288
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,730
Come again tomorrow.

289
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,710
Boss,

290
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,070
I'm a regular customer from our hometown.

291
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,330
I have an appointment.

292
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,350
I'd like Jiguzhai's The Social Contract.

293
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,920
The version you want is sold out already.

294
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,430
Do you want a copy from last year?

295
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,550
Please wrap it up for me.

296
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,240
Come in.

297
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,550
Let me get you some water.

298
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,310
It's okay.

299
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,550
I just wanted to ask

300
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,080
what happened to your face.

301
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,170
Here?

302
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,930
My brother-in-law did it.

303
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,810
Er Hu,

304
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,120
there's a guest.

[Rosemary Coffee, the day after tomorrow at 3 P.M., fold a corner of the newspaper]

306
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,070
From today onwards,

307
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,430
you all will undergo onboarding training.

308
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,150
We will use the classroom as the main medium

309
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,510
and practical operation as supplement.

310
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,230
Relevant subjects include

311
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,150
banking,

312
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,480
business accounting principles,

313
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,030
the financial market,

314
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,270
business English,

abacus usage,

banknote inspection,

317
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,230
telegraphy, and more.

318
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,150
Among them, business accounting principles

319
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,950
will tie all subjects together.

320
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,700
Today, we will start

321
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,050
with banking.

322
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,440
Please open your textbook to chapter one,

323
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,530
the Bank System.

324
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,550
Has the onboarding training begun?

325
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,380
Yes, sir.

326
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,550
It's in the conference room.

327
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,940
They're having class now.

328
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,600
Keep an eye on that kid. Be strict.

329
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,060
He must master the basics.

330
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,010
Yes, sir.

331
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,230
On your desk, you have

332
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,250
one real and one counterfeit silver coin.

333
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,910
There are actually two ways

334
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,330
to identify counterfeit coins.

335
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,380
First, use the thumb and middle finger

336
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,710
of our right hand

337
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,350
and vertically grasp the coin.

338
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,060
Then knock against it with the index finger of the other hand.

339
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,900
Knock on it.

340
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,230
Listen.

341
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,150
It can produce a crisp sound.

342
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,670
The second method

343
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,880
is to blow on the edge of the coin.

344
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,150
After blowing,

345
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,750
bring it to our ear to listen.

346
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,870
It can produce

347
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,070
a very clear and crisp sound.

348
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,110
We must practice hard every day.

349
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,740
Not only do we have to practice in a quiet environment,

350
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,080
but also on the streets.

351
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,210
Assistant Manager Liu,

352
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,770
excuse me.

354
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,990
come out for a moment.

355
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,349
Secretary Huang,

356
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,359
why can't I join the training?

357
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,980
Listen carefully.

358
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,460
I didn't say you can't.

359
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,619
But first of all, you're Mr. Shen's assistant.

360
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,190
You have your job.

361
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,470
Of course,

362
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,359
you still have to participate in the assessment.

363
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,599
If you fail, you'll be fired on the spot.

364
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,880
Then the training...

365
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,609
This is the rule set by Mr. Shen.

366
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,670
You must memorize

367
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,230
every word that I say next.

368
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,160
Understand?

369
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,310
Yes.

370
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,150
Then go write it down.

371
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,880
Yes.

372
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,410
First,

373
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,590
all matters

374
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,510
must be reported in advance,

375
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,310
coordinated during the process,

376
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,390
and followed up afterward.

377
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,090
Second,

378
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,050
put Mr. Shen first in all matters.

379
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:47,910
Your attire

380
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,550
can neither steal Mr. Shen's thunder

381
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,910
nor embarrass him.

382
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,890
Third,

383
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,990
all of Mr. Shen's decisions and intentions

384
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,700
must be strictly confidential.

385
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,100
Have you written it down?

386
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,550
Go on.

387
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,350
Do you know what the essence of being an assistance is?

388
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,700
Help him handle miscellaneous tasks and serve tea—

389
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,330
Wrong.

390
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,310
The essence of an assistant

391
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,910
is to save time for Mr. Shen,

392
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,850
so you have no personal time.

393
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,030
You must be on standby 24 hours a day.

394
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,270
Your eyes,

395
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,990
hands,

396
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,550
ears,

397
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,150
feet,

398
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,030
and brain must all be quick.

399
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,210
If you're not quick-witted,

400
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,820
then nothing can be quick.

401
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,250
Why aren't you writing down what I said?

402
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,350
I've memorized it already.

403
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,270
How arrogant.

404
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,020
I will tell you everything necessary.

405
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,830
It's on you if you don't write it down.

406
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,150
What I just said was the precautions.

407
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,560
Next will be the work content.

408
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,080
First,

409
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,310
the documents you give to Mr. Shen every day

410
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,070
must be sorted according to the date.

411
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,340
Every official letter sent out

412
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,250
must be checked three times

413
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,140
to ensure that there are no errors.

414
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,900
Second,

415
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,310
put a glass of warm water

416
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,230
on Mr. Shen's desk

417
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,870
before 8 A.M. every morning.

418
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,590
Remember, you must boil and cool it down on the spot.

419
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,830
My water

420
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,230
must be hot.

421
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,020
You're not afraid of getting burned?

422
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,430
No problem.

423
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,310
Third,

424
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,000
you must personally arrange the conference room,

425
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,200
place name tags, and arrange the seats.

426
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,910
Fourth,

427
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,790
you must strictly record

428
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,910
every phone call

429
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,350
and its content.

430
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,100
Fifth,

431
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,250
you must check the reimbursement accounts every day.

432
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,450
Hello?

433
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,480
Okay, hold on. Let me look for it.

434
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,990
Hello?

435
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,230
Yes.

436
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
This is the data.

437
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,800
It hasn't changed.

438
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,980
1,073.

439
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,440
Hello?

440
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,080
Sir.

441
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,050
Coming.

442
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,560
Sir, we've arrived.

443
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,810
Okay.

444
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,280
Thank you.

445
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,120
[Rosemary Coffee]

446
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,670
Hello, sir.

447
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,160
What would you like to drink?

448
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,750
Coffee.

449
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,910
Okay, please wait a moment.

450
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,040
It'll be ready soon.

451
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,450
Don't worry.

452
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,470
Everything is ready.

453
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,820
There'll be no escaping.

454
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,380
Sir,

455
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,470
he's in the cafe.

456
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,580
We have everything under control.

457
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,350
Go.

458
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,430
Wait in the car.

459
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,490
So you didn't marry Catherine

460
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,310
because of her father?

461
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,240
My father broke a leg in the Marne River.

462
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,190
Her father was a French artilleryman.

463
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,310
Can you imagine the situation

464
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,790
if the two fathers met at the wedding?

465
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,150
If I were Catherine,

466
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,810
I would elope with my beloved.

467
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,980
Unfortunately, you're not.

468
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,250
This is amazing.

469
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,270
Of course.

470
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,630
I chose this place.

471
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,310
Let's have a drink.

472
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,150
Sure.

473
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,270
A cup of White Lady.

474
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,010
I'll drink beer.

475
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,120
Do you like this place?

476
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,480
Very much.

477
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,280
It reminds me of

478
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,650
when we were studying in Germany,

479
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,630
You still like to drink beer.

480
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,860
You still remember?

481
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,250
Cheers.

482
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,860
Cheers.

483
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,420
Tell everyone not to shoot.

484
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,050
If anyone dares to shoot, I'll kill him.

485
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,530
Okay.

486
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,340
Tell everyone not to shoot today.

487
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,880
Your teacher was very unhappy when you came back.

488
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,830
Every time he got drunk, he would say

489
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,270
he lost a genius student.

490
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,150
I called him many times,

491
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,480
but he never picked up.

492
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,470
He must still be mad at you.

493
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,090
Probably.

494
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,470
My old friend is here. I'll go and say hello.

495
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
Okay.

496
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,060
Captain.

497
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,340
Captain Lin.

498
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,150
Miss Shen.

499
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,830
What a coincidence.

500
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,630
Why are you here?

501
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,510
I'm here for business.

502
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,320
Great timing.

503
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,390
Here.

504
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,140
Wilhem.

505
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,950
Captain Lin.

506
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,790
He's the captain of the Investigation and Arrest Unit of the Shanghai Garrison Command.

507
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,830
He graduated from Huangpu

508
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,670
and is young and promising.

509
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,710
When I did onboarding training in Shanghai,

510
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,910
he was my instructor.

511
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,080
Nice to meet you.

512
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,420
Nice to meet you.

513
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,480
Step back.

514
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,350
Step back.

515
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,790
Miss Shen,

516
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,550
I'm here for business.

517
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,190
It's dangerous here.

518
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,470
Leave this place quickly.

519
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,590
Let's have a drink together.

520
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,030
I'm on a mission here.

521
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,840
What happened?

522
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,060
Don't ask. Leave now.

523
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,550
Go!

524
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,910
What happened?

525
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,030
Don't ask. Just go.

526
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,730
Be careful!

527
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,590
Sir,

528
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,770
is there a misunderstanding?

529
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,080
I'm in Shanghai for business.

530
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,490
This case seems very important.

531
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,890
It's worth my life.

532
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,650
I'm a businessman, after all.

533
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,560
You only drank half of the coffee.

534
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,810
What a waste.

535
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,680
I have something else to do.

536
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,510
I have a question that I can't figure out.

537
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,390
Back in the day,

538
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,500
why did Engels sponsor Marx?

539
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,980
Sir,

540
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,410
I've never heard of

541
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,270
these two people.

542
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,580
Since we're here,

543
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
let's chat.

544
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,860
Let's chat,

545
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,200
since you still have the strength now.

546
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,110
We have different paths.

547
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,440
We're unable to work together.

548
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,440
Don't you all say that you have great ideals?

549
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,240
Preach it to me.

550
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,790
Convince me.

551
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,190
Convince you about what?

552
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,230
To let me go?

553
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,660
You can try.

554
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,530
It might work.

555
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,900
Let go of me!

556
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,060
I can walk by myself.

557
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,860
Let go!

558
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,830
Let go!

559
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,710
Do you know

560
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,640
how long it took Lenin to overthrow

561
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,880
the corrupted Tsarist Russia?

562
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,990
Go back. Leave this place.

563
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,030
It's dangerous.

564
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,070
Move!

565
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,880
Move!

566
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,830
Move!

567
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,950
Move!

568
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,590
Watch him.

569
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,170
Yes.

570
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,230
Sir.

571
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,350
He must have escaped.

572
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,790
Come here.

573
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:53,990
Kneel!

574
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,260
Listen carefully.

575
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,030
He can't go far because he's injured.

576
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,110
If he wants to treat his injury,

577
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,040
he can only go to a civilian doctor.

578
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,710
He won't dare to go to the city.

579
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,230
He must be nearby.

580
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,110
Search all the nearby shanty towns

581
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,710
and slums one by one.

582
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,550
Do you hear me?

583
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,350
Yes.

584
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,890
I wanted to run back to save him,

585
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,310
but I heard gunshots.

586
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,400
Lonely Star lured the enemy to the other side.

587
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,590
Later, I rode Wilhem's car

588
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,390
and passed by the scene.

589
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,920
I found blood on the ground.

590
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,900
If he's arrested, it's over.

591
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,170
He shouldn't be arrested yet.

592
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,830
Later, I called Lin Qiaosong.

593
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,480
He was very anxious

594
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,680
and hung up quickly.

595
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,030
I don't think he completed his mission.

596
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,400
We must contact Lonely Star as soon as possible.

597
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,510
The gold bars on him are very important.

598
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,550
Of course, if he successfully escaped,

599
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,760
then according to the rules,

600
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
he will use the emergency contact method

601
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
and publish an encrypted ad on The Crystal.

602
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,350
I've seen Lonely Star.

603
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,820
I can go with my comrades to find him.

604
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,470
No.

605
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,590
Why not?

606
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,720
You were in many missions recently

607
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,450
and appeared at the cafe today.

608
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,910
We can't let Lin Qiaosong

609
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,510
deepen his suspicion of you.

610
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,390
Xu,

611
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,870
you're right.

612
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,290
We should know when to advance or retreat,

613
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,130
but I can't not do anything.

614
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,940
What else can I do?

615
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,720
Recently,

616
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,080
the Central Bank has big plans.

617
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,150
You go look into it.

618
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,270
Find out the transactions of large amounts of funds

619
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,430
and the usage of every transaction soon as possible,

620
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,430
especially the military expenses.

621
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,800
Okay.

622
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,950
You can't even do this small task?

623
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,350
Are you stupid?

624
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,180
There were so many people around, but you let him escape.

625
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,510
If you don't want to work anymore,

626
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,830
get out of here!

627
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,390
Get out!

628
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,300
Get out!

629
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,830
Sir.

630
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,430
Let's talk later.

631
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,250
Sir,

632
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,920
it’s not your fault today.

633
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,520
If Miss Shen hadn't showed up

634
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,540
and disrupted the plan,

635
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,400
we wouldn't have been so passive.

636
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,610
Are you blaming Miss Shen?

637
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,630
Of course it's her fault.

638
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,830
If something happened

639
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,150
to Shen Tunan's sister

640
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,410
during our operation,

641
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
do you think

642
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,260
we could get away with it?

643
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,780
It's not only us.

644
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,510
Even Mr. Kang would be affected.

645
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,650
Captain.

646
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,520
Biao.

647
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,710
Sir,

648
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,280
our mission failed in order to save Miss Shen today

649
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,310
and you got yelled at.

650
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,440
You have to tell her.

651
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,730
We can't take the loss.

652
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,110
No need.

653
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,940
We are friends with boundaries.

654
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,970
It's fine as long as no one is humiliated.

655
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,230
Sir,

656
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,500
you really need to learn from Chairman Chiang

657
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,950
in some aspects.

658
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,760
In what aspects?

659
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,270
When he fell in love with his wife at first sight,

660
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,630
he chased after her

661
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,620
at all costs.

662
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,360
Shut up!

663
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,610
Did you catch Lonely Star?

664
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,990
I'll go now.

665
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,710
Tunan,

666
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,570
have some milk.

667
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
What have you been busy with lately?

668
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,040
Studying armored steel plates.

669
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,190
How is it?

670
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,230
Don't mention it.

671
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,650
It gives me headache.

672
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,850
We can only import it from England now.

673
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,070
Our metallurgy technology

674
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,720
is too far behind,

675
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,510
but the steel plates from England are too expensive.

676
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,880
Every armored car

677
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,460
costs a fortune.

678
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,210
Take things step by step.

679
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,270
Going from zero to one is the hardest.

680
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,590
Research requires money.

681
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,030
You'll get it soon.

682
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,030
The Central Bank

683
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,590
has gotten stronger recently,

684
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,860
so I believe

685
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,030
you'll have more funding

686
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,950
for construction and scientific research in the future.

687
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,910
Really?

688
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,230
That's great.

689
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,450
I'll be waiting.

690
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,460
But

691
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,030
how come your Central Bank

692
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,430
suddenly got stronger

693
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,190
and has money for our research?

694
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,620
You're a little strange today.

695
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,950
How?

696
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,400
You were not interested in finance before.

697
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,260
I just want to get more research funds.

698
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,570
Hurry up and tell me.

699
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,910
You really want to hear about it?

700
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,770
I want to learn from you. Hurry up.

701
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,960
To put it simply,

702
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,120
we just acquired the Imperial Bank of China.

703
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,910
Next,

704
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,800
we will continue to acquire private banks

705
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,330
for resource integration.

706
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,790
Such a big move.

707
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,610
Is

708
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,700
the government short of money again?

709
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,420
What are you talking about?

710
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,250
The government is always short of money.

711
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,690
We need money

712
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,500
to eliminate the Communists.

713
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,730
I know nothing about war,

714
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,060
but I have to be responsible for the money.

715
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,680
Do you understand?

716
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,260
Forget it. It'll be stranger

717
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,690
if you can understand.

718
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,310
Here.

719
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,380
Have some milk.

720
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,560
You've worked hard.

721
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,810
Crack another one.

722
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,150
Okay.

723
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,929
I'll crack as much as you want.

724
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,130
I'll do it myself.

725
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,139
Be quiet.

726
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,630
Brother?

727
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:33,989
Close the door.

728
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,360
You know to come back?

729
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,810
I need you to do something.

730
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,179
I'm busy.

731
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,630
You left without saying anything three years ago.

732
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,150
You didn't even leave a letter.

733
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,880
Dad and I thought you were dead.

734
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,510
Don't light the lamp.

735
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,790
You sound so nervous and you won't even let me light the lamp.

736
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,030
Are you a thief?

737
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:03,830
Brother.

738
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,730
Brother, what's wrong?

739
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:07,960
Brother,

740
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,970
why are you bleeding so much?

741
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,150
I'll take you to the hospital.

742
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,800
Let's go.

743
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,350
Brother.

744
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:12,880
Let's go.

745
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,020
Come on.

746
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,540
Ruolai.

747
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,550
I'm not going.

748
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,050
Brother.

749
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:20,780
It's too late.

750
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,470
Brother.

751
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,590
It's too much blood.

752
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,750
We need to go to the hospital.

753
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,630
Let's go.

754
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,430
I'm not going.

755
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,640
Brother.

756
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm not going.

757
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,140
What are you talking about?

758
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,070
I'm thirsty.

759
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,240
I'm thirsty.

760
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,830
Water.

761
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,440
Water.

762
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,830
Water.

00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,030
You'll find a good school and study.

834
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,630

835
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,300

I won't study.

839
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,430
I'll beat you to death.

840
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,700
You're so smart.
