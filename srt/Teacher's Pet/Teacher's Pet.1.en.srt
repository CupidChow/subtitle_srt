1
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,442
You failed.

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,447
Your brain's a little weak.

3
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:34,426
But I know a way

4
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:37,548
for you to pass.

5
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:46,055
No one can know about this, okay?

6
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:49,156
If you tell anyone,

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,461
I'll ruin your life.

8
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,376
Would you like some?

9
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,155
Why are you crying?

10
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:23,187
You know...

11
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:25,439
when I'm sad,

12
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,737
my mom buys me a lollipop.

13
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,908
Here, you can have this,

14
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,071
so you won't be sad anymore.

15
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:39,714
Here.

16
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:47,003
Why are you sad?

17
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:52,344
You won't understand.

18
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:53,776
Huh?

19
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,746
I'm already studying,

20
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,074
and I'm even top eight in our class.

21
00:02:58,348 --> 00:02:59,808
I can understand that.

22
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,274
I'm Kyla, by the way.

23
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,325
And you? What's your name?

24
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:14,737
Tanya.

25
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,657
Kyla!

26
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,565
Kyla!

27
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:24,621
Kyla!

28
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:28,128
I have to go now. Bye.

29
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,494
Don't cry anymore, okay? Bye!

30
00:03:57,414 --> 00:03:59,374
Guys! Teacher Tanya's here!

31
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,761
You're beautiful, ma'am.

32
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,131
Oh, you're just flattering me, Mr. Castro.

33
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:10,337
Anyway, head inside
so we can start the class.

34
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,992
Uh... ye... Yes, of course.

35
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,910
- Let me get that for you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,664
- Hi, ma'am. Watch your steps.
- Hi. Thank you.

37
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:35,668
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hello. Hi.

38
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:41,390
Ma'am, don't you get tired of smiling?

39
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,550
It's like,

40
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,611
since you became a teacher here last year,

41
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:49,472
I've never seen you frown at anyone.

42
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,185
That's just how I am.

43
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,853
I want to keep things happy,

44
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:57,732
positive vibes, so I can
spread it to those around me.

45
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,894
You're so cute ma'am...
I mean... you're so kind, ma'am.

46
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:06,752
Not like some teachers who are
already grumpy in the morning.

47
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:08,862
I wish all teachers were like you, ma'am.

48
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,329
They're annoying.

49
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:16,229
You naughty kid,
you say all sorts of things.

50
00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:20,259
You should smile at your teachers too,

51
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:23,665
you never know,
you might make their day better.

52
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:25,749
Okay.

53
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,880
Robin!

54
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,467
It's time to eat!

55
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,612
I've been calling you!

56
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,232
Oops!

57
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:59,401
You're late.

58
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:01,608
The flag ceremony
already started.

59
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:05,640
Pres, I'm only five minutes late.

60
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,303
Come on. Right?

61
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,504
Come on, just let me in.

62
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,317
Rules are rules.

63
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:14,268
I'm just following them.

64
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,599
Good morning.

65
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:26,736
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hi.

66
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:28,736
Good morning.

67
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,008
Hey.

68
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,230
Oh?

69
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:36,028
- Where do you think you're going?
- You're so violent!

70
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:38,698
Ouch!

71
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,097
- Go ahead and line up.
- Thanks, President!

72
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,932
Very good. Beautiful.

73
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,006
That's good.
Put more flour in it.

74
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:53,228
Oh!

75
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,184
Robin, what are you doing?

76
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,931
What happened to you?

77
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:02,039
Why do you look like that?

78
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,991
You're such a mess.

79
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:09,441
Look at you, you're all sweaty
like you're playing around.

80
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:19,153
Do you even know
what you're doing?

81
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,519
- Didn't I teach you how to do this?
- Yes, ma'am!

82
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,893
Look, it's cracking already.
Put some flour on it.

83
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:28,919
Put it there and roll it.

84
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,814
Can't you see it's cracking already?
There, like that.

85
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:39,351
Ah... Is there a problem?

86
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:40,737
No, ma'am.

87
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:43,958
What happened to your face?

88
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,478
Okay...

89
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:50,818
- You need to add more flour.
- Like this?

90
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:51,843
Yes.

91
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:04,617
Robin.

92
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:07,787
- Robin?
- Oh... ma'am.

93
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:11,207
Are you okay?
You look a bit off.

94
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:14,322
Uh... It's nothing.
I'm probably just hungry.

95
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:19,070
You're making yourself hungry
and drinking soft drinks on top of that...

96
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,513
You might get sick.

97
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:24,860
No, ma'am. I'll take care of myself.

98
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:26,495
I'm still going to marry you...

99
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:30,705
You naughty kid!

100
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,008
Alright, I'm going home.
You go home too and eat, okay?

101
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:37,893
Don't skip meals.

102
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,710
Bye, ma'am.

103
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,391
Mr. Castro, why aren't
you heading home yet?

104
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:59,867
Uh... Ma'am, happy Teacher's Day.

105
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,790
Oh...

106
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:05,596
Isn't this a bit too much?
You really are something.

107
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,119
It's not that much, ma'am.

108
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:08,838
Uh...

109
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:11,946
Besides, you deserve it.
You're so kind.

110
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:13,519
Thank you, Robin.

111
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,736
Uh... Ma'am, I have...

112
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,070
I have something I want to say...

113
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,352
What is it?

114
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,685
Ma'am, I like you.

115
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,850
Not just as a teacher.

116
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,293
I like you as a woman.

117
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:37,347
I know... I know it's wrong.
I know it's impossible but...

118
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,028
But I can't hide it anymore, ma'am.

119
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,179
I really like you a lot.

120
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,457
Ma'am, can I court you?

121
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:51,163
You really are something else.
You always think of the craziest things.

122
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:54,625
Thank you for liking me,

123
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:59,213
but... I'm sorry, I can't
accept your request.

124
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:04,844
You're my student,
and I'm your teacher.

125
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:06,898
That's all it can be, okay?

126
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:13,573
It's okay to like someone,
just not me. Okay?

127
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,935
You have so many kind
and beautiful classmates.

128
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:21,627
Why not focus on them instead? Right?

129
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:24,113
Anyway, take care on your way home.

130
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:34,813
Hey!

131
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,208
Oops...

132
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,188
Sorry...

133
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,183
Damn it!

134
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:54,981
What bad luck!

135
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,408
Hey girls, look at Ms. Tanya and Sir Hugo.
They look like a couple. So sweet.

136
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:06,193
Maybe they're really a couple.
They're always together.

137
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:09,012
They're so cute.
She's beautiful and he's handsome.

138
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:11,938
She's not that beautiful,
she just got fair skin.

139
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:14,803
Come on, she's beautiful.

140
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,510
I think two for her and
three for me is perfect.

141
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:21,943
- Make it four for each of us.
- There's no more left?

142
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,120
That's all for today, class.

143
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:25,217
Please review... we'll have
a quiz tomorrow, okay?

144
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:27,386
- Class dismissed. See you tomorrow.
- Thank you, ma'am.

145
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,973
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you. Bye.

146
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,867
- Let's go home!
- Take care.

147
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,450
Take care, bro.

148
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,915
- Bye.
- Bye.

149
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:44,932
Uh, ma'am...

150
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:48,290
- Do you need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

151
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,156
Why are you still here, Robin?

152
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,087
Aren't you going home yet?

153
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:17,867
Is there a problem?

154
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:22,600
Anyway, I'm going to go now.

155
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,533
Take care on your way home.

156
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,792
Ma'am...

157
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,770
I know your secret.

158
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:00,881
Hold this for me and come with me
back to the house.

159
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,776
Let's head inside and talk.

160
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:45,226
Ma'am...

161
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,679
What's going on
between you and Kyla, Ma'am?

162
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,801
You saw it, right?
Why are you still asking?

163
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:02,094
Are you two together?

164
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,121
We've know each other
for a long time.

165
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,113
Before I even became a teacher.

166
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,826
But we became a thing just last year.

167
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,306
Robin, please, if there's still
any respect left in your heart,

168
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,585
don't tell anyone about what you saw, okay?

169
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:24,645
Please.

170
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,843
Please...

171
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:45,246
I'll report you, Ma'am.

172
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:18,814
What is it that you want?

173
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:22,793
Is this what you want?

174
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,490
Ma'am...

175
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,310
That Robin had a different smile on him...

176
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:29,717
- Huh?
- You take me for a fool?

177
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:32,772
Did something happen
that I don't know about?

178
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,951
You're overthinking.

179
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:39,221
Just focus on your review,
the periodical exams are coming up.

180
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:47,121
Everyone in our batch knows
that Robin is crazy about you.

181
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:55,587
I know. So that's
why we need to be careful.

182
00:31:56,224 --> 00:31:57,249
Why's that?

183
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,423
He already knows about us.

184
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:09,766
He caught us the other day.

185
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:11,556
He even has a video.

186
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:13,827
What?

187
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:16,026
But, don't worry.

188
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:18,621
I got this. I'll find a way.

189
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,166
How?

190
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:22,849
Just...

191
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:25,372
Trust me, okay?

192
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:21,941
Hey! Why are you up?

193
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,866
You weren't beside me.

194
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,758
What's that?

195
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,553
Playtime.

196
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,888
I'm playing Playtime.ph.

197
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:34,824
Playtime.ph?

198
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,891
Yeah!

199
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,185
This game involves an e-wallet.

200
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,670
My brother just taught me,

201
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,024
so I tried it also.

202
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:47,551
He always gets to scatter.

203
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,825
I also win sometimes.

204
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,286
There are a lot of games in the site.

205
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Is that legit?

206
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,581
Of course!

207
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,421
You know what,

208
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:07,617
if I ever get the chance to scatter,

209
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:10,129
I'll be able to save up money.

210
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:12,916
When I've been able
to save up money,

211
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,764
you won't have to work ever again.

212
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,933
I will be the one to support you.

213
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,300
You're nuts.

214
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,396
Why? Don't you want that?

215
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,024
Okay. Go ahead, play.

216
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,817
Give it your best shot.

217
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,248
See!

218
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:42,416
So great!

219
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:44,360
I told you!
I'm going all in.

220
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,639
But wait.
Make a wish first.

221
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,339
Wish that I win.

222
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,008
Blow on it.

223
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,801
Let's see.

224
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,012
You're so cute.

225
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:03,819
- Wow!
- I told you we'd win!

226
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:05,293
You're my lucky charm.

227
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:07,374
You're amazing!

228
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,936
No, you're the one who's amazing.

229
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,115
Hi, Kyla!

230
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:38,659
It's too early to be this grouchy.

231
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:44,891
Weren't you able
to score one last night?

232
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:49,954
I see.

233
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:52,297
Because, I did.

234
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:55,109
Shoot! Three points!

235
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,566
Solid!

236
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:01,431
Oh my!

237
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:03,349
You didn't know?

238
00:43:06,145 --> 00:43:07,771
Didn't your girlfriend tell you?

239
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:11,900
That's big trouble.

240
00:43:39,678 --> 00:43:40,678
Go home.

241
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:44,949
Ma'am, I love you.

242
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:47,527
What?

243
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:49,688
Do you love me too?

244
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,683
Well...

245
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:55,652
So much has happened between us.

246
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,342
Let's just be together instead.

247
00:43:59,698 --> 00:44:01,366
What are you talking about?

248
00:44:04,953 --> 00:44:06,914
Aren't you disgusted by Kyla?

249
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:15,314
Goodness! Such a great show.

250
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:17,132
Good job!

251
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:21,970
Why would she be disgusted by me?

252
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:25,849
You're the one who's disgusting.

253
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,687
Besides, aren't you blackmailing us?

254
00:44:31,396 --> 00:44:33,023
Because you want to score.

255
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:37,319
What do you call yourself?

256
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Are you clean?

257
00:44:39,696 --> 00:44:40,696
Kyla.

258
00:44:41,156 --> 00:44:42,156
Are you perfect?

259
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:43,699
Huh?

260
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:48,539
Wait. Hold on a minute.

261
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:53,877
Love? He loves you he said.

262
00:44:54,753 --> 00:44:55,753
Love?

263
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,049
Does Teacher Tanya love you?

264
00:45:02,594 --> 00:45:05,556
You're not just jealous,

265
00:45:06,598 --> 00:45:08,350
you're crazy too.

266
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:13,634
Wait! What was the term
for that, Teacher Tanya?

267
00:45:14,354 --> 00:45:17,359
Oh wait!
I remember now.

268
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,974
Delusional.

269
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:24,007
Don't you dare try me!

270
00:45:24,032 --> 00:45:25,466
I hit women!

271
00:45:25,491 --> 00:45:27,336
Stop it please.

272
00:45:28,496 --> 00:45:29,705
You don't have it in you.

273
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,542
You're a tough guy, right?

274
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:36,478
Want to try us both?

275
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:37,575
Kyla.

276
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,310
You're that horny, right?

277
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:22,100
I didn't know
you smoked cigarettes, ma'am.

278
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,343
Just when I'm thinking
about something.

279
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:35,362
When I was your age,

280
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,403
there was so much I wanted to prove.

281
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,385
Just like Kyla.

282
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,641
She can do anything
for her education.

283
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:50,980
Until,

284
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,255
my teacher used that
to take advantage of me.

285
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,101
I'm close.

286
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,659
During those times, I met Kyla.

287
00:54:33,032 --> 00:54:34,408
She was the one who saved me

288
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:36,393
during the times I wanted to give up.

289
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:45,207
Hey, Tanya!

290
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:48,382
That's great!
You're not crying anymore.

291
00:54:48,908 --> 00:54:51,035
Are you a big girl now?

292
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:55,906
You're getting brave.
You stopped crying.

293
00:54:58,276 --> 00:54:59,819
I'm going to give you something.

294
00:55:01,412 --> 00:55:02,872
I bet you'll like it.

295
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:07,466
Do you want some?

296
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,640
Come on. Kidding!
This is mine.

297
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,685
The view is pretty over here.

298
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,063
But you're prettier.

299
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:18,984
We're friends from now on.

300
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:23,269
Oh...

301
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,695
Why are you crying?

302
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,283
Stop crying.

303
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:32,455
Oops!

304
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,015
There's a rock!
Be careful.

305
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,281
Hold on.

306
00:55:37,306 --> 00:55:38,306
Okay...

307
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:48,186
I love you.

308
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,656
You're too young.

309
00:56:04,523 --> 00:56:05,774
So what?

310
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,081
Even though I knew it was wrong,

311
00:56:16,968 --> 00:56:18,136
it wasn't right thing to do.

312
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,795
It's just that I rarely feel love.

313
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,116
Robin, please.

314
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:08,125
Don't involve Kyla.

315
00:57:20,378 --> 00:57:22,129
Guys!

316
00:57:23,229 --> 00:57:25,136
Ma'am Tanya isn't here anymore.

317
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:27,111
Huh? Why is ma'am absent?

318
00:57:27,136 --> 00:57:28,929
Idiot! She resigned.

319
00:57:29,247 --> 00:57:31,216
The gossip in the faculty is crazy!

320
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:34,866
You must be the reason
why she's gone, Robin.

321
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:35,915
You scared her away.

322
00:57:36,642 --> 00:57:38,077
This is all your fault, Robin.

323
00:57:38,102 --> 00:57:39,499
Your stare is so intense

324
00:57:39,524 --> 00:57:40,942
as if you're undressing her.

325
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:43,495
That's right!

326
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:45,442
Me?

327
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,403
Why me?

328
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:49,630
There, blame Kyla.

329
00:57:49,655 --> 00:57:51,281
- Why?
- Are you clean?

330
00:57:51,306 --> 00:57:52,450
Why blame Pres?

331
00:57:52,475 --> 00:57:55,024
- Are you perfect?
- He's taunting you.

332
00:57:55,912 --> 00:57:58,998
Perfect!

333
00:58:00,374 --> 00:58:01,667
What is it?

334
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:04,128
What's happening?

335
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:07,215
Why are you blaming Pres?

336
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:11,441
Why Pres?

337
00:58:12,945 --> 00:58:15,156
Shut it! Pres is crying.

338
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:16,181
Oh no!

339
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:29,378
And now for our valedictorian speech,

340
00:58:29,403 --> 00:58:32,459
let's welcome Kyla Marie Sanchez.

341
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:36,494
Like most of us,

342
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:39,747
I learned

343
00:58:40,623 --> 00:58:44,126
that life is not a straight line.

344
00:58:45,711 --> 00:58:48,548
There is no right way to grow up.

345
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:52,492
There is no right way to live.

346
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:56,426
Everyone makes mistakes.

347
00:58:57,139 --> 00:59:00,434
We stumble from our own decisions.

348
00:59:02,395 --> 00:59:03,729
Even if it hurts,

349
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,359
we still have to pay for it.

350
00:59:10,154 --> 00:59:12,823
Sometimes we get away from punishment,

351
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:16,109
but we accept

352
00:59:17,034 --> 00:59:19,787
that everything is a lesson.

353
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:33,426
To the person I love the most,

354
00:59:34,215 --> 00:59:35,293
thank you.

355
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:40,019
You were the source of my strength

356
00:59:43,477 --> 00:59:45,938
even though you were struggling.

357
01:00:30,149 --> 01:00:31,776
Accept it, Robin.

358
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:36,238
There are women meant for another woman.

359
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,242
You can't change that.

360
01:00:41,322 --> 01:00:43,324
I get it. Damn it!

361
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:45,514
You talk too much.

362
01:00:51,335 --> 01:00:53,170
I'll study hard.

363
01:00:54,907 --> 01:00:56,284
I'll graduate.

364
01:00:58,636 --> 01:01:01,829
And then I'll be rich,

365
01:01:04,016 --> 01:01:05,834
so that

366
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,865
I won't give a damn what others say.

367
01:01:14,249 --> 01:01:15,959
Then I'll look for her.

368
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,846
Wherever she is.

369
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:26,085
How about that?

370
01:01:27,556 --> 01:01:28,891
We have the same goal.

371
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:35,015
You just don't quit, huh?

372
01:01:44,974 --> 01:01:48,499
We're like a cat and a dog
chasing after our owner.

373
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,570
Am I right?
