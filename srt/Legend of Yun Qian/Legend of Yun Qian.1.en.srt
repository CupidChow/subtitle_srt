00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,250
(Episode One)

2
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,330
(Huayue)

3
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,420
(Muyun Shifu)

4
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,250
Have you memorised all the sutras I assigned?

5
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,250
Shifu. Weren't you taking a nap?

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,580
Where are you running off to?

7
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,380
Unless you've memorised them by the end of the day,

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,650
don't even think about going anywhere.

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,220
You should go back inside.

10
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,820
Shifu, look!

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,050
I think something's on fire!

12
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,820
(Xiaoqian)

13
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,650
Who are you?

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,650
Shh.

15
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,700
Don't be scared.

16
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,980
I won't do anything bad to you.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,050
Oh, I understand now.

18
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,180
So you time-travelled here in order to escape.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,650
But you really do look exactly like me.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,130
Could you be me from a past life?

21
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,250
Past lives? Reincarnation?

22
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,530
I don't believe in any of that.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,580
But now that you've run away like this,

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,300
won't your shifu be worried?

25
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,300
Don't even mention my shifu.

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,880
If I went back now,

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,730
she'd just drag me off for martial arts practice.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,780
Is she really as scary as that?

29
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,850
I'd like to see her for myself.

30
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,380
If you did see her,

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,900
you could very well be mesmerised by her!

32
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,780
Really?

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,380
Is she a great beauty?

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,530
Of course.

35
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,300
But an icy beauty.

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,900
Now that you've said that,

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,530
I really do want to see her.

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,500
By the way,

39
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,980
is this the fan you used to time-travel here?

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,380
Oh, be careful!

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,540
Lingchuan Sect.

42
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,560
Oh, so this is Lingchuan Sect!

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
I've ... travelled through time?

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,400
Never mind.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,260
Since I'm here, I might as well make the most of it.

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,840
Let's have a look around.

47
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,540
Disobedient disciple, are you still asleep?

48
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,140
Get up.

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,710
The poem I taught you yesterday.

50
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,510
Have you memorised it?

51
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,440
She's so beautiful.

52
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,800
All you do is slack off.

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm sure you haven't memorised the mathematical formulas either.

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,710
Can I first ask...

55
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,270
who are you?

56
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,790
Is there ... something wrong with her?

57
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,930
Listen to this question.

58
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,890
Four times seven

59
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,650
Xiaoqian: Twenty-eight!
Shifu: If you don't memorise, how—

60
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,710
What are you doing?

61
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,710
I care about you!
[T/N: In Chinese, this phrase sounds exactly the same as 'I'm breathing on you!']

62
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,130
So this is Huayue jiejie's shifu.

63
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,130
She doesn't seem

64
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,730
as scary as Huayue jiejie made her out to be.

65
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,130
Read your book.

66
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,150
What are you looking at me for?

67
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,590
I can't read this.

68
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,790
It's too boring.

69
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,670
Why don't we...

70
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,110
Why don't we go out for a walk?

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,630
Mm.

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,660
Wow! Shifu, look!

73
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,310
Water lanterns!

74
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,460
Today is the Qiqiao Festival.
[T/N: A festival celebrating the annual meeting of the cowherd and weaver girl in Chinese mythology.]

75
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,200
Of course there are people releasing water lanterns.

76
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,680
Why are you still standing there?

77
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,180
Let's go!

78
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,080
There's no need to rush.

79
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's make a wish first!

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,740
I...

81
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,520
I have nothing to wish for.

82
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
How can that be?

83
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Don't you have something you like?

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,980
I grew up as a disciple of the Lingchuan Sect.

85
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,140
The sole duty of my life

86
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,800
is to ensure peace on earth,

87
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,020
and prevent the Fans of Heaven and Earth from falling into the wrong hands.

88
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,920
Now that the world is at peace,

89
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,820
I have no other desire.

90
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,680
Shifu seems...

91
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
...so very lonely.

92
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,540
I wish...

93
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,040
I wish Shifu can find her heart's desire

94
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,840
and become happy.

95
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,680
Shifu—

96
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,400
Ah!

97
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,680
Shifu,

98
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,960
we had so much fun today.

99
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,560
Look!

100
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,430
The moon is so full tonight.

101
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,400
It's beautiful.

102
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,100
Xiaoqian! You're back.

103
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,280
Where did you go?

104
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,840
...Who was she?

105
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,380
She looks exactly the same as Huayue.

106
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,180
But

107
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,320
I can tell that she definitely isn't Huayue.

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,420
Oh? You met my shifu?

109
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,580
Then...

110
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,600
Was she angry?

111
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,680
Of course she was!

112
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,460
She even said

113
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,680
once you go back,

114
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
she's going to make you copy out the sutras three hundred times

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,280
I was just joking!

116
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,820
She didn't seem to have realised who I was.

117
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,020
I also think

118
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,020
she isn't as scary as you said she was.

119
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,660
I actually think she's quite adorable.

120
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,480
Since you like her so much,

121
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
why don't you go back and deal with her for me.

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,660
and I'll stay here and have fun.

123
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,140
Huayue: How does that sound?
Xiaoqian: Great!

124
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,000
But can you manage by yourself?

125
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,460
Don't worry,

126
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,500
I can do it!

127
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,800
Why are my thoughts

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,040
so scattered today?

129
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,740
What is this place?

130
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,990
Oh?

131
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,240
Who is that?

132
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,020
It's you!

133
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,840
My name is Xiaoqian.

134
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm a friend of Huayue jiejie's.

135
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,720
What's your name?

136
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,530
Close your eyes.

137
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,210
Hm?

138
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,420
Quickly.

139
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,180
Retreat!

140
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,160
It's all right now.

141
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,080
Shifu looks so cool when she's fighting!

142
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,220
You still haven't told me

143
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,580
what your name is.

144
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,340
My name is Muyun.

145
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,240
So, you and Huayue jiejie have been protecting this fan

146
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,600
because it hides a secret

147
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,780
that would shake the whole of the jianghu on its foundations.

148
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,020
You've been looking at it all day.

149
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,440
Have you discovered anything?

150
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,640
What's this on the fan?

151
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,850
I don't understand it.

152
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,640
Let's stop looking at it.

153
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,400
Shifu! Wait for me!

154
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,600
You're walking so fast.

155
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,650
You are walking too slowly.

156
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,600
What do you mean I'm too slow?

157
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,260
You're obviously trying to leave me behind!

158
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,600
I wouldn't do that.

159
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,800
The Fans of Heaven and Earth have reappeared.

160
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,940
They are the treasures of our sect

161
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,760
My master will be along to retrieve them soon.

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,840
Shifu!

163
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,920
Drink some water.

164
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,380
What...

165
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,440
You've stayed here too long.

166
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,520
Your body might not be able to take it much longer.

167
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Hurry back to your own time.

168
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,820
But you've been hurt so badly.

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,080
If I leave,

170
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,340
what about you?

171
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,740
Quickly. Take the fan and go home.

172
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,000
You should come with me.

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,640
That way

174
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
you can hide from the attackers

175
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,280
while recovering from your injuries.

176
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
Isn't that a good idea?

177
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,660
But...

178
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,000
But what?

179
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,180
Let's go!

180
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,560
Ah, what are you doing?

181
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,200
Danger.

182
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
This is my pet.
(His Majesty's name is Mooncake.)

183
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,460
Why don't you play with him for a bit.

184
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,960
I'm going to take a shower.

185
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,680
Shifu!

186
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,840
Do you want to shower together?

187
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,740
No, thank you.

188
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,960
I... I'll sleep on the floor.

189
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
No, you can't.

190
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,580
You still haven't recovered fully.

191
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
We should ... sleep together.

192
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,100
All right.

193
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,780
My nice soft bed!

194
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,780
I'm finally home.

195
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,600
I like this so much!

196
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,220
Shifu, do you like it too?

197
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,560
I do like...

198
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,920
this blanket.

199
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,860
Is the blanket the only thing you like?

200
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,660
Shifu, have you ever liked anyone before?

201
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,320
No.

202
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,240
Then...

203
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,460
what's your type?

204
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,480
My type?

205
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,420
I mean... what type of person do you like?

206
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,980
Why... why are you asking me this?

207
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,740
I just want to flirt—

208
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,560
I mean, understand you better.

209
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,260
I want to know

210
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,660
what you like to eat,

211
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,320
what you like to do,

212
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
what colours you like,

213
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
what books you like.

214
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,360
Shifu...

215
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,120
Shifu.

216
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,380
What I think I look like after waking up.

217
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,040
In reality...

218
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,150
Hundreds of years later,

219
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,060
the world has become so strange.

220
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,620
Let's go somewhere fun!

221
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,640
There is a killing aura.

222
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,900
This is my home.

223
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,480
Why would there be a killing aura?

224
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,020
It's a Frozen Ice Palm expert.

225
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,440
Are you talking about this?

226
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
This is the air conditioner.

227
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I'll go and cook you something.

228
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,360
What is it?

229
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,860
Where is the Fire Cloud Palm expert?

230
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,660
Chill!

231
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,420
Remember, this is 'technology'.

232
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,220
It makes our lives more convenient.

233
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,080
How is it convenient?

234
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,400
It's just alarming.

235
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,240
That's because you don't understand it.

236
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,920
I think your martial arts are strange.

237
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,600
All you know how to do is fight.

238
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,380
Oh no.

239
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,980
I forgot to chill the Coke.

240
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,340
Wow, it's so cold!

241
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,160
You are the one who doesn't understand.

242
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,180
I'm giving you chills!

243
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,380
Don't be naughty.

244
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,360
Why do the people of your time

245
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,600
like taking photographs so much?

246
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,500
Because that's how you record your happiest moments

247
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,500
with the people who are most important to you.

248
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,890
Shifu, why don't we—

249
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,310
Wow!

250
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,460
That outfit is so beautiful!

251
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Come and take a photo with us!

252
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,160
Let's go!

253
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,640
I thought you were off taking photos with them.

254
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,520
Didn't you say

255
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,180
photographs should be taken with those who are important to you?

256
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,040
I'm a little hungry.

257
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,460
Why don't we go and have some supper?

258
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,440
Hello, ladies.

259
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,780
Where are you going so late at night?

260
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,300
I think you two

261
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,240
should leave as quickly as possible.

262
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,870
Hehehe.

263
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,980
The moon is so bright tonight.

264
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,940
Are you sure you don't want to stay and have some fun with us?

265
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,940
Don't come over here! Or else—

266
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,750
Hey.

267
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,200
Not so hard!

268
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,200
Let's go.

269
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,200
Muyun,

270
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,480
let's go and get something to eat.

271
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,940
Call me shifu.

272
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,840
I'll cook you something.

273
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,380
Mm.

274
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,420
Let's eat!

275
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,180
Absolutely delicious.

276
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,340
I have never tasted noodles this good.

277
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,580
Remember

278
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,940
the ancestral teachings of the Lingchuan Sect:

279
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
to protect the Fan of Heaven.

280
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,940
If there is no necessity,

281
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,900
do not descend into worldly society.

282
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,780
This world

283
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,000
has nothing to do with us.

284
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,500
Yes.

285
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,260
If you must enter worldly society,

286
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
then it is for you to decide

287
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,740
whether that is worth it.

288
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,820
It is said

289
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,340
the Fan of Earth was destroyed with its master long ago.

290
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,780
Now that this anomaly has occurred,

291
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,780
could it be...?

292
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,840
Xuanyu,

293
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,080
I can finally save you.

294
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,560
Shifu, I'm going to get more snacks.

295
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,720
(Hongyan, fourteenth leader of the Xingyue Cult)

296
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,300
What a strong killing aura.

297
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,540
I thought the Fan of Heaven would be heavily guarded.

298
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,860
I didn't imagine

299
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,340
it would be in the hands of a half-trained child like you.

300
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,600
Why does she look so much like Xuanyu?

301
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,640
Hongyan,

302
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,140
you are far too extreme and stubborn.
(Xuanyu, thirteenth leader of the Xingyue Cult)

303
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,660
In future, you need to be more restrained.

304
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
Or else not even I will be able to protect you.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,420
Now that you've become leader,

306
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,240
you're throwing your weight around.

307
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,060
Before this,

308
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,720
you always took my side.

309
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,780
I'm going to punish you with a period of self-reflection.

310
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,080
Three days.

311
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,920
Hand over the Fan of Heaven.

312
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,360
The Fans of Heaven and Earth must not fall into outsiders' hands.

313
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,920
Why do you seek the fan?

314
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,120
Cut to the chase.

315
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,220
You and I both know

316
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,100
the Fans of Heaven and Earth allow travel through time.

317
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,160
But how they turn back time

318
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,220
and reverse yin and yang

319
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,860
is a closely-guarded secret of our sect.

320
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,180
If you wish to learn it,

321
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,360
you must promise me one thing.

322
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
Your life is in my hands,

323
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,080
yet you still dare to bargain with me?

324
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,680
The worst that can happen to me is death.

325
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,020
Tell me.

326
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,720
My disciple will be here soon.

327
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,900
Please don't frighten her.

328
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,220
What an affectionate pair you are!

329
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,920
As long as you promise not to harm her,

330
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,280
I will help you.

331
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,620
Shifu.

332
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,240
This is...?

333
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,740
An old friend.

334
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,860
How are you? My name is Xiaoqian.

335
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
Shifu,

336
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,580
how should I address her?

337
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,550
Er...

338
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,500
My name is Hongyan.

339
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,360
She has spoken about you before.

340
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,220
Really?

341
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,420
Hongyan?

342
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,660
Hongyan jie,

343
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,820
how did you and shifu meet?

344
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
We became friends...

345
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,180
through an exchange of martial arts.

346
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
Hongyan jie, you must be good at martial arts,

347
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
just like shifu.

348
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,380
Of course.

349
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,180
Wow, that's so cool!

350
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Shifu, now that Hongyan jiejie is here,

351
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,580
we won't have to worry about running into those bad guys from the other day!

352
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,400
Of course.

353
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,540
If they dare to approach us,

354
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,960
I'll strike them down with my palm—

355
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,380
You've just arrived in this era.

356
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,540
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet.

357
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,680
Shifu,

358
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
let's take her out for a nice meal.

359
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,940
Well...

360
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,400
What should we eat?

361
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,520
Roast duck? Grilled fish? Or lamb skewers?

362
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
Hongyan jie, your name sounds Sichuanese.

363
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,370
Do you eat spicy food?

364
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,340
Hongyan jie, what should we eat tonight?

365
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
KFC or McDonald's?

366
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,840
Muyun: I must think of a way to get rid of her.
Xiaoqian: I'm sure you've never had Western food before.

367
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,480
Let's have Western food.

368
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,940
Shifu?

369
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,240
I'm feeling a little tired.

370
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,560
Let's go home.

371
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,420
All right!

372
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,300
Mr Driver, please drive off quickly.

373
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,820
Isn't Hongyan jiejie coming?

374
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,620
She...

375
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,720
has something else to do.

376
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,680
(Ten minutes later)

377
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,900
Hongyan jie!

378
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,700
I thought you'd left.

379
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,380
How could I bear

380
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,580
to leave you two behind?

381
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,960
Hongyan jie,

382
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,040
did you... run all the way here?

383
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,660
You were travelling so slowly,

384
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,960
it wasn't even difficult for me

385
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,120
Are you all this good at qinggong?
[T/N: A martial arts technique which gives practitioners the ability to move swiftly.]

386
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,120
She is better.

387
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,340
If you try anything like that again,

388
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
I'll kill both of you.

389
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,120
Have a seat.

390
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,520
I'll go and order.

391
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,740
Who knew that a sect leader

392
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,320
would need a little girl to look after her?

393
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,100
Watch your words.

394
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,900
If you're not careful enough in this era,

395
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,020
you will die.

396
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,700
What is that?

397
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
That is a modern-day messenger pigeon.

398
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,840
In essence,

399
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,060
it is a type of bird.

400
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,260
How does that thing look like a bird?

401
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,060
It is called

402
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,160
a hand chicken
[T/N: In Chinese, this sounds exactly the same as 'mobile phone'.]

403
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,100
Who is that?

404
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
A takeaway delivery person.

405
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,700
That's a type of security escort.

406
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,040
Security escort?

407
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
What kind of valuables do they escort?

408
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,040
Food.

409
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,980
What is that?

410
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,360
That is

411
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,520
a steel horse.

412
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,580
Nonsense.

413
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,720
If that's a horse,

414
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,000
then what's this?

415
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,160
This is

416
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,160
a steel donkey.

417
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,110
Shifu, can you bring this to Hongyan jie?

418
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,960
Yes.

419
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,910
Eat.

420
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,390
How do I eat this?

421
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,170
Peel it.

422
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,510
I'm not eating it anymore!

423
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,080
What's going on?

424
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,980
Wow.

425
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,270
The way you've cut this mango

426
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,460
is... acceptable.

427
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,500
Hehe.

428
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,090
Ouch.

429
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,880
Show some respect.

430
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
Then I'm going to dig in!

431
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,880
Aren't you having some, Hongyan jie?

432
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,460
She doesn't like it.

433
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,460
What a pity.

434
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
This mango is so sweet.

435
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,040
Shifu, have some.

436
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,400
I'll just watch you eat.

437
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,040
Our sect has been in seclusion for many years.

438
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,580
I forbid you from leaving our mountain to wreak havoc.

439
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,040
It is said that

440
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,280
the Fans of Heaven and Earth can bring the dead to life

441
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,440
and reverse the will of Heaven.

442
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,890
I must use them to save you.

443
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,530
The fates of mortals are determined by Heaven.

444
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,420
The Fans of Heaven and Earth

445
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,780
are not something you or I can control.

446
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,920
If you persist on your current path,

447
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,300
I will have to punish you severely

448
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,240
in accordance with the rules of our sect.

449
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,500
I have feared nothing

450
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,880
in my entire life.

451
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,440
Except...

452
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,560
losing you.

453
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,540
Hongyan.

454
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,280
Who is she?

455
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,740
Hongyan of the Xingyue Cult takes the liberty of

456
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,180
challenging the three Masters of the Kunlun Sect.

457
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,820
Should I be victorious,

458
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,900
I hope you will lend me your sect's Fan of Earth.

459
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,320
Kunlun Elder #1: If you win, I'll hand over the fan on a silver platter!

460
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,000
Hongyan: I was fortunate enough to win.

461
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,960
Kunlun Elder #1: Where did this witch come from?

462
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,600
Kunlun Elder #1: Her techniques are so violent.

463
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,540
Kunlun Elder #2: The Kunlun fan cannot fall into her hands.

464
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,320
Kunlun Elder #3: There are no outsiders here.

465
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,020
Kunlun Elder #3: If we all attack.

466
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,520
Kunlun Elder #3: and prevent word from getting out, we can keep our defeat a secret.

467
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,020
Kunlun Elder #1: Attack!

468
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,940
Hongyan: A respectable sect like yours

469
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,940
Hongyan: would betray its own word?
Kunlun Elders: Kill the witch!

470
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,660
At present,

471
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,420
the Xingyue Cult has made many enemies in the jianghu

472
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,240
because of Elder Hongyan's

473
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,340
senseless slaughter of three hundred members of the Kunlun Sect.

474
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,280
This is a crime of treason against our sect.

475
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,520
From this day,

476
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,320
Hongyan is expelled from our sect.

477
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
What is it?

478
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,820
What's wrong with Hongyan jie?

479
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,820
This is a sign of qi deviation.

480
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,540
I think

481
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,440
I finally know who she is.

482
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,600
After the incident at Kunlun Sect,

483
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,880
Hongyan returned to the Xingyue Cult.

484
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,400
Sect Leader Xuanyu had already passed away by then.

485
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,860
They say

486
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,940
Hongyan experienced qi deviation when she heard this news

487
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,500
and seized control of the Xingyue Cult by force.

488
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,040
And then she disappeared without a trace.

489
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,920
Hongyan jie

490
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,180
is a woman of deep passions.

491
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
I still remember

492
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
what I read in the books when I was young.

493
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,460
But even in my time,

494
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,760
she had been dead for over a hundred years.

495
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,420
Then how could she...

496
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,060
This has the power to upend Heaven and Earth.

497
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,480
And the Fans of Heaven and Earth can sense each other.

498
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,940
I believe she must have something to do

499
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,460
with the attacks earlier.

500
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,940
She is here for the Fan of Heaven.

501
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,500
Then, what should we do now?

502
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,200
Don't worry.

503
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,820
I'm here.

504
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,560
Miss Hongyan.

505
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,300
What is it?

506
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,020
Why are you so weak at martial arts?

507
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,960
You need to practise more.

508
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,520
What?

509
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,390
A child like you

510
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,670
could never beat me.

511
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,270
Not even if you practised for a hundred years!

512
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,120
Xuanyu!

513
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,540
Xuanyu.

514
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,140
From now on

515
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,980
I'll have to call you Sect Leader Xuanyu.

516
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
My duties are weighty indeed.

517
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,700
You have me to help you!

518
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,220
With a martial arts genius like me by your side,

519
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,260
who would dare to cause us trouble?

520
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,830
Xuanyu and Hongyan will never meet again,

521
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,790
whether in life or death.

522
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,760
My culinary skills are so-so,

523
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,540
so you'll have to put up with this.

524
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,980
It looks good.

525
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,920
Shifu, come.

526
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,120
You should eat more.

527
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,860
Shifu.

528
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,760
It seems I have stayed here too long.

529
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,760
Shifu,

530
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,120
I'll go back with you for a little while.

531
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,100
Hongyan jie!

532
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,200
What's wrong?

533
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,240
I have no intention of harming you two.

534
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,500
Give me the Fan of Heaven now.

535
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,480
I'm about to—

536
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,700
Are you Xuanyu?

537
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,280
Did you forget what you promised me?

538
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,800
No, you're not Xuanyu.

539
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm going to bring her back right now!

540
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,380
Xiaoqian!

541
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,680
You must not have suffered enough!

542
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,940
Hongyan jie!

543
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,300
Please calm down.

544
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,760
Hongyan jie.

545
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,600
Hongyan jie.

546
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,260
Hongyan jie!

547
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,440
I know all you want to do is save Xuanyu.

548
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,120
Truly.

549
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
I'm sure Xuanyu knows that too.

550
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,480
Everyone says you're a cold-blooded murderer.

551
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,820
And there's nothing in the world you're afraid of.

552
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,280
But I know nothing else in the world matters to you.

553
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
All that matters is not losing her.

554
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,620
Isn't that right?

555
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,380
I also have someone I want to spend the rest of my life with.

556
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
I know how you feel.

557
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,640
Why didn't you run away?

558
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,000
Hongyan jie,

559
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I couldn't bear to.

560
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,400
I couldn't bear to see you in such pain.

561
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,340
Please don't carry on like this any longer.

562
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,840
Shifu.

563
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,840
You came.

564
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,060
You keep stopping me from saving Xuanyu.

565
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,320
When the two fans are combined,

566
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,960
the effects might be felt by only one person

567
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,520
or they might impact the whole world.

568
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
My sect has kept the Fan of Heaven safe for hundreds of years.

569
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,560
How could I let you use it for your selfish ends?

570
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Then I'll kill you first!

571
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,240
No.

572
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,900
The Fans of Heaven and Earth have souls of their own.

573
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,040
Only those who are true of heart

574
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,820
can master them.

575
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,080
Once they acknowledge someone as their master

576
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,360
there will be a sign.

577
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,340
I will help you.

578
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,520
Give me the Fan of Earth.

579
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,970
Shifu.

580
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,990
It will be all right.

581
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,790
Trust me.

582
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,460
Heaven gives birth to all things.

583
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,940
Earth gives life to all things.

584
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,940
If the Fans of Heaven and Earth are used for good,

585
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,780
peace will come to the world.

586
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,820
If used for evil,

587
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,320
the natural order will be perverted

588
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
and all will be corrupted.

589
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,620
Those who wish to live will die.

590
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,040
Those who wish to die will live.

591
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,420
Those who love will hate.

592
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
Those who hate will disappear into nothingness.

593
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,200
Hongyan jie!

594
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,670
Resurrecting the dead,

595
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,030
inverting Heaven and Earth,

596
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,740
that's against the natural order.

597
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,460
What do you know?

598
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,860
This could cause so many more people

599
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,440
to lose their lives.

600
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,080
If she were the one to die today,

601
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,460
what choice would you make?

602
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,640
What have you done?

603
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,200
Shifu!

604
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,520
Shifu...

605
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,300
I'm just an ordinary girl.

606
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,320
Meeting you

607
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,760
was the best thing that ever happened in my life.

608
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,540
You still haven't told me

609
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
what your name is.

610
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,200
My name is Muyun.

611
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,640
I can finally

612
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,860
do something for you.

613
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,650
Don't say these silly things.

614
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,860
You'll be all right.

615
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,830
After this,

616
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,120
you have to live well.

617
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,260
You have to be chill.

618
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,950
Chill!

619
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,960
Hongyan.

620
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,540
Clinging to the past.

621
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,280
A lifetime of pain.

622
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,840
Was it worth it?

623
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Do you know what is in my heart?

624
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,700
When I expelled you from our sect,

625
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,280
it was in the hope that you could avoid our enemies,

626
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,920
and live a peaceful life on your own.

627
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,920
I have never been afraid!

628
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,720
Hongyan.

629
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,720
Did you ever know what was in my heart?

630
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,140
Do you know how long I've waited

631
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,320
to hear you say that?

632
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:45,120
Let us repair past wrongs together.

633
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,720
What do you say?

634
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,840
We are sorry.

635
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,400
Xiaoqian,

636
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,860
I'm taking you home.

637
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,910
Shifu.

638
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,390
Shifu.

639
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,250
Shifu.

640
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,750
Shifu.

641
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,900
Xiaoqian: Were you crying just now?
Muyun: No...

642
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,820
Xiaoqian: But I heard you!
Muyun: No.

643
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,140
Xiaoqian: Hmph, Shifu is cheating.

644
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,140
Muyun: ...Call me Muyun.

645
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,760
Shifu's first visit to my home

646
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,920
What is this?

647
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,400
You haven't drunk in a while.

648
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,680
You must miss it.

649
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,040
I bought this especially for you.

650
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,120
What a strange smell.

651
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,800
Try it!

652
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,540
Another glass?

653
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,230
Huh?

654
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,310
The next day

655
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,040
The one yesterday was too strong.

656
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,960
This is milder.

657
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,950
Try it.

658
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,040
It's sweet. Delicious.

659
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,000
Mm!

660
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,550
Cheers!

661
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,620
Huh?

662
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,540
Shifu.

663
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,630
The fifth day after that

664
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,920
Try it?

665
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,590
I had better not.

666
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,640
Just a little taste.

667
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,000
Then I will have just one sip.

668
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,650
Mm!

669
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:09,990
Ah?

670
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,600
'I walk through flower fields'

671
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,480
'and none turn my head.'

672
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,760
'Half because my path is set'

673
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,390
'and half because of you.'
[T/N: Taken from Tang Dynasty poet Yuan Zhen's Five Odes for the Departed, written in memory of his late wife.]

674
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,270
Cuddle.

675
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,220
This is how it happened

676
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,970
I wanted to show Shifu how to brush her teeth

677
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,920
I finally got her to brush her teeth

678
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,460
This is how you do it. Up, then down.

679
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,580
Up and down.

680
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,540
What are you doing?

681
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,700
Delicious.

682
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,160
DELICIOUS

683
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,760
