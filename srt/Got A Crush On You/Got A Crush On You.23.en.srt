(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 23=

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,780
Mengnan.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,980
Get me a bottle of water.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,860
I thought you said you didn't
get this brand.

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,820
I went to the supermarket,

28
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,620
and they had stock.

29
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,140
Also, get me a cake.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,860
Low sugar.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,620
I have some here.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
Okay.

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,500
Not bad, Mengnan.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,010
Everything I want, you have it today.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,420
Come.

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,940
You even had this?

37
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,060
There's eye massager and fascia gun too?

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,420
I have a cloak if you're cold.

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,860
Sure.

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,940
At this rate,

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,460
I'll have to give you a raise.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,660
Really?

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,780
Thanks, boss.

44
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,780
Why did you come to me?

45
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,260
Take this.

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,620
What's this? It's heavy.

47
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,580
This is for Qingyin.

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,090
She probably will need these.

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,540
Don't tell her they're form me.

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,940
In case she needs them,

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
you won't have to make the trip.

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,540
There's so many stuff.

53
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,420
Before this,

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,980
I thought you were unreliable.

55
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,300
Now I see

56
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,060
you really care about Qingyin.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,220
Next time you have a shooting,

58
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,100
tell me beforehand.

59
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,260
I'll prepare everything.

60
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,220
Nice?

61
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,180
Nice.

62
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,220
So pretty.

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,290
We're here.

64
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,340
We're here.

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,700
So pretty.

66
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
Dad, Mom.

67
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,500
Let's go for a spin.

68
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,460
Yeah, let's go to the beach.

69
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,220
I won't be going with you, babe.

70
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,660
Where are you going?

71
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,150
There's a viral pool there.

72
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,100
I want to swim in it.

73
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,860
Sure. Be careful.

74
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,620
Bye.

75
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,180
Go.

76
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,940
Bye.

77
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,540
We can fish here.

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,500
Good. You picked the right spot.

79
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,060
Of course I did.

80
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,300
My girl's right. Let's go.

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,980
Go.

82
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,300
This place is nice.

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,440
(Camping at the Sea)

84
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,380
One, two.

85
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,140
One, two.

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,340
One, two.

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,060
Keep up.

88
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,660
One, two.

89
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,220
One, two.

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,380
People, let me reiterate.

91
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,060
We're doing this training in the waters

92
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,620
so you guys can adapt

93
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,820
to underwater operations.

94
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,740
During our usual rescue missions,

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,060
the waters

96
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,100
take up thirty percent
of our rescue cases.

97
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
This is very important.

98
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,180
Our training today

99
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,900
involves searches in bodies of water
and motorboat driving.

100
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,460
And also what happens if boats capsize.

101
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,860
I hope everyone

102
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,110
can put in everything you have

103
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,420
for this training.

104
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,140
I will be strict with you guys.

105
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,780
Alright, get ready. Begin.

106
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,620
Yes.

107
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,660
Where's Dad?

108
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,620
He went fishing.

109
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,340
I mean

110
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,580
strolling on the sands
and enjoying the winds

111
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,980
is nice.

112
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,860
Your father won't even move
from his spot.

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,940
Dad doesn't have many hobbies.

114
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,270
It's alright. I'll be with you.

115
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,190
What do you think of this place?

116
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,080
Is it alright?

117
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,540
It's beautiful.

118
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,740
You picked it. Of course, it's nice.

119
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,740
You didn't ask Su

120
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,500
to come with us

121
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,020
on this vacation?

122
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,500
This is our family vacation.

123
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,820
None of his business.

124
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,940
Honestly, your father and I

125
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,220
don't ask much

126
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,420
from your boyfriend.

127
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,780
As long as he's nice
and treats you well,

128
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,300
we're fine.

129
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,940
Dad might call me

130
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,420
endearingly all the time,

131
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,100
but I know you worry about me
the most, Mom.

132
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,660
That's what I want to hear, girl.

133
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,580
What happened there?

134
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,340
There's a ton of people.
Maybe something happened.

135
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,340
Let's check it out.

136
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,980
Sure.

137
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,980
Let's go.

138
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,140
I think it's some training.

139
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,860
Hey.

140
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,820
Isn't that Su?

141
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,220
Oh, family vacation?

142
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,540
This is the real reason

143
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,360
you brought me and your father
to the beach.

144
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,340
Did you two plan this?

145
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,580
I swear

146
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,740
Su Qingche had no idea you two
were coming.

147
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,940
So this was your idea.

148
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,300
I was wondering

149
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,060
why you suddenly

150
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,260
took us to the beach for a vacation.

151
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,860
Look, he's cool, isn't he?

152
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,140
They're training.

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,280
Your mother-in-law is here.

154
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,900
Don't just stare. Go.

155
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,860
We're training.

156
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,620
I'll cover for you. Give me.

157
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,580
Ask her if Xiaoli is here.

158
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,380
Keep an eye on them.

159
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,940
Go.

160
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,060
Team two, get ready.

161
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,500
Yes.

162
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,700
Mrs. Song, what brings you here?

163
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,020
Xingchen, why didn't you tell me?

164
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,980
I'd pick Mrs. Song up.

165
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,580
It's alright.

166
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,620
We had time,

167
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,390
so I asked my folks

168
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,700
and Xiaoli on a vacation.

169
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,140
I know you're busy training,

170
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,740
so I didn't tell you.

171
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,180
What about Mr. Song and Xiaoli?

172
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,900
My dad went fishing on the sea.

173
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,540
Xiaoli went swimming in the pool.

174
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,340
This is your rescue team?

175
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,780
Do they get paid

176
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,740
doing this?

177
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,140
We're a charity organization,

178
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,660
Mrs. Song.

179
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,660
Those guys

180
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,180
have their own jobs.

181
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,500
They came here voluntarily.

182
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,740
But

183
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,260
these things you do

184
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,220
take a lot of time and energy.

185
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,220
Do you think it's worth it?

186
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,580
As long as I can help someone,

187
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,140
it is.

188
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,100
It's alright, Qingche.

189
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,220
You go to work.

190
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,780
I'll take my mother and show her around.

191
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,740
You go to work.

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,700
I'll get back to training.

193
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,420
But when I'm done, I'll come to you.

194
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,340
Sure.

195
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,100
Go.

196
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,980
That's good.

197
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,580
But I feel like you

198
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,700
are making a bad deal here.

199
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,260
Mom, this is charity.

200
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,740
He's doing something good.

201
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,380
That's not what I say.

202
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,740
I understand that.

203
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,380
I mean that you

204
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,060
are now focused

205
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,380
on him now.

206
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,340
No use asking

207
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
your mother for opinions.

208
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,860
Not bad from Dr. Song.

209
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,620
Having her mother

210
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,860
check out our training.

211
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,790
Alright, let's not talk about that.

212
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,450
Let's train.

213
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,660
Did you ask if Xiaoli is here?

214
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,220
She is. She's in the pool.

215
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,900
Really?

216
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,960
Don't think about that.

217
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,060
Train.

218
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,940
No problem.

219
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,620
Let's go.

220
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,980
We'll speed up.

221
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,700
You have 20 seconds left.

222
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,540
(Everything started because of me.)

223
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,170
(Let me take responsibility.)

224
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,820
(If there's a next life,)

225
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,660
(I'll still love you.)

226
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,900
(No.)

227
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,180
A lost love.

228
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,700
How regretful.

229
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,300
Xiaoli.

230
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,260
Xiaoli.

231
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,940
Why are you here?

232
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Because we're doing training here.

233
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,410
I met Xingchen and her mom.

234
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,680
They said you were swimming here,

235
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,170
so I came.

236
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,660
You should go back to training.

237
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,020
Xiaoli.

238
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,260
Anything?

239
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,140
Why are you hiding from me?

240
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,300
I am not.

241
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,460
I...

242
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,060
I just want some time

243
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,660
for myself.

244
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,580
You can't run from me.

245
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,420
Just look at me.

246
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,730
Maybe you'll find me tolerable
if you look at me more.

247
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,740
Xiaoli.

248
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,740
I really like you.

249
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
You're being pushy.

250
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,830
We'll camp here tonight.

251
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,080
I told Xingchen and the others.

252
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,150
We're doing this together.

253
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,620
Babe.

254
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,700
Did you tell Lu Qun

255
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,740
I was at the pool earlier?

256
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,220
I was in a swimsuit. It was so awkward.

257
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,780
Be confident, you.

258
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,570
Besides,

259
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,480
not like he hasn't seen you naked
before.

260
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,580
You have a great body.

261
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,620
What are you talking about?

262
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,340
Xiaoli, I'm done.

263
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,380
We can eat now.

264
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,200
You guys chat.

265
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,620
All your favorites.

266
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,300
Mr. and Mrs. Song didn't come?

267
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,620
They said they wanted to rest.
They're tired.

268
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,820
What did Mrs. Song say to you?

269
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,740
What?

270
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,380
You want to know?

271
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,460
I won't tell.

272
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,860
Are you sure?

273
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,540
I am.

274
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,820
Last chance.

275
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,580
Are you telling me?

276
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,190
I am not.

277
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,140
Look at him.

278
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,740
He's touching her.

279
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,500
You're really something.

280
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,380
They're dating.

281
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,660
Does it bother you that they're just
tickling each other?

282
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,820
Have you forgotten when we were young?

283
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,060
When I was their age,

284
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,300
we knew

285
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,220
when to stop and be courteous.

286
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,860
Look at them.

287
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,300
Enough.

288
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,500
That isn't courteous at all.

289
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,500
He's doing it in public.

290
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,860
Lower your voice and stop nagging.

291
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,900
Just as well.

292
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,700
Since we're still here,

293
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,420
let's observe them.

294
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,500
This is how they really get along
in their relationship.

295
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,970
What do you want? I can grill for you.

296
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
I am not eating.

297
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,700
Are you alright?

298
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,210
It's alright.

299
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:07,830
Just got burned.

300
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,340
You got burned. This is not alright.

301
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,740
Let's go. There's salve in the tent.

302
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,410
Let's go.

303
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,540
Someone take over the grill.

304
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,380
Coming, Captain Su.

305
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,780
Sure thing, Captain Su.

306
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,940
Let's go.

307
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,660
Hey.

308
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,700
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

309
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

310
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,420
This juice is nice.

311
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,500
Why don't we do this?

312
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,460
Black and white. Loser drinks.

313
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,080
Is that alright?

314
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,760
- Sure.
- Sure.

315
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,300
- Black and white.
- Black and white.

316
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,310
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

317
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,070
Aren't you playing?

318
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,280
Rock, paper, sci...

319
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,000
I am not playing.

320
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,940
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

321
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,500
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

322
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,860
How about this?

323
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,500
I'll play one round.

324
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:54,860
Sure.

325
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,940
Here we go.

326
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,030
Dice aren't enough.

327
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,860
One dice per person.
Let's play big or small.

328
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,360
Sure.

329
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,900
Is your hand alright?

330
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,820
What are you doing?

331
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,830
Why did you pull me?

332
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,020
Don't get in the way of their business.

333
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
I won't let you go in.

334
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,100
I raised that girl for years.

335
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,020
And that brat just...

336
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,820
This makes me mad.

337
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,460
I think Su

338
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,980
is fine.

339
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,420
Jianguo.

340
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,350
You might not know this,

341
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,300
but earlier,

342
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,580
I saw how serious he was at work.

343
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,780
He seems reliable.

344
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,380
Reliable?

345
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,100
I'm telling you,

346
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,460
I don't like him.

347
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,260
What are you laughing at?

348
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,060
I...

349
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,900
I think

350
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,540
you're jealous of Su.

351
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,580
I'm telling you,

352
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,260
don't you forget

353
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,900
that Xingchen has to marry someday.

354
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,540
I am jealous.

355
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,900
Honestly,

356
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,500
you're not mad anymore.

357
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,420
You

358
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,860
changed fast.

359
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,620
This is called

360
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,060
knowing the situation.

361
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,740
Think about it.

362
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,220
Xingchen went through

363
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,500
a lot just for us

364
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,780
to acknowledge Su.

365
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,020
We should

366
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,260
play along

367
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,540
and relent.

368
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,180
Captain Lu.

369
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,460
It's the 11th round.

370
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,780
Why don't we just stop here?

371
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,220
It's alright.

372
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,260
Hey, I'll take a leak.

373
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,610
I'll continue after I come back.

374
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,690
Continue after I come back.

375
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,380
Oh, you can take toilet breaks?

376
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,060
Some people

377
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,220
look like they can win a lot,

378
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,940
but they'll lose to some people someday.

379
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,980
This is fate.

380
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,220
Here, cheers.

381
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,260
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

382
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,980
Here.

383
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

384
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,540
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

385
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,820
What's up?

386
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,700
Say whatever's on your mind.

387
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,230
I bought two tickets for a play.

388
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,820
Can we watch it together?

389
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,420
You watch opera?

390
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,180
It soothes the heart.

391
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,060
Captain Lu said

392
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,060
that Dr. Song and Captain Su
started dating

393
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,140
after they watched an opera.

394
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,140
When?

395
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
A few months ago.

396
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,460
I mean when's the opera?

397
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,910
The day after tomorrow.

398
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,100
The day after tomorrow at 7:00 p.m.

399
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,180
Sure.

400
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,520
Pass me the ticket.
I'll come if I'm free.

401
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,940
I bought it a long time ago.

402
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,130
I just didn't have the courage
to give it to you.

403
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,270
In case you reject me.

404
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
Am I that scary?

405
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,470
So I'm horrifying?

406
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,860
You're not horrifying.

407
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,980
You're more

408
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,760
on the cuter side.

409
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,740
Patience is key in life,

410
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,740
do you understand?

411
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,820
So did we

412
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,520
unlock the door?

413
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,900
Lin Mu.

414
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,700
You're such a blockhead.
[*Mu]

415
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,500
You can be firewood.
[*Mu: wood]

416
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,420
Firewood?

417
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,260
Hey.

418
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,500
So are you going

419
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,460
to the opera or not?

420
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,180
Xiaoli.

421
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,500
What are you doing?

422
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:02,980
Well...

423
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,780
Um...

424
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,020
Sorry.

425
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,340
You go first.

426
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,700
Back at the pool earlier,

427
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,740
I was a little rash.

428
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,300
It's alright.

429
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,420
You've been like that all this time.

430
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,660
What I want to say is

431
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,420
all this time,

432
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,380
I thought

433
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
you hid from me
because of a misunderstanding.

434
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,900
But these couple of days,

435
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,100
I've been thinking a lot.

436
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,740
It's not your problem.

437
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,410
My approach to getting along with you
isn't right.

438
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,300
Since I've decided to woo you,

439
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,140
I should be genuine about it.

440
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,340
You're not saying that

441
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,640
because you got drunk, did you?

442
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,620
No.

443
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,980
I don't know how to explain

444
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,940
what happened in the past.

445
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,740
I have no idea

446
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,860
what else I should prove,

447
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,860
but

448
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,860
from today onward,

449
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,260
I'll have you see

450
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,660
the true me.

451
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,700
All the pickup lines and flirting stuff,

452
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,380
I won't use them on you anymore.

453
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,020
Because I know

454
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,820
what I truly want.

455
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,460
What I want

456
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,380
is to be with you forever.

457
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,980
Xiaoli.

458
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,740
I really,

459
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,580
really like you.

460
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,040
I've thought about it.

461
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,620
I want to give you

462
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,780
and myself another chance.

what were you going to tell me?

466
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,340
It's not important now.

Morning. Rise and shine.

Not bad, chef.

473
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,860
How romantic.

474
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,580
I invited your mom and dad too.

475
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,620
I wonder if this

476
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,660
can earn me extra points.

477
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,580
This might not move my folks.

478
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,660
What if they're stubborn?

479
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,620
Then I'll melt them as best I can.

480
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,560
Dad, Mom, morning.

481
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,640
Mr. and Mrs. Song, morning.

482
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,810
Breakfast is done. It's there.

483
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,630
You guys have a seat.

484
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,760
We'll sit there.

485
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,180
Not bad, right?

486
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,820
Not bad.

487
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,300
Honestly,

488
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,220
I'm not used to breakfast like this.

489
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,620
Talking about mornings,

490
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,900
I prefer your mom's cooking.

491
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,300
What?

492
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,100
We don't get to have a vacation
every day,

493
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,800
and you want me to make breakfast
for you?

494
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,220
Dream on.

495
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
I think

496
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,900
Su's breakfast isn't bad.

497
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,960
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

498
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,180
Dad.

499
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,540
I just want to have breakfast

500
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,740
beside the sea with you guys.

501
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,300
Yeah.

502
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
What's wrong?

503
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,700
I didn't sleep well.

504
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,780
The weather's hot.

505
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,740
Good.

506
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,140
Have an egg.

507
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,020
Finish this sandwich

508
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,160
and fill yourself up.

509
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,780
We'll get some sunbathing done

510
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,830
and replenish some calcium.

511
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,660
Yeah.

512
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,540
Dad, I'm telling you,

513
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,490
Qingche knows this place well.

514
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,250
Is there any spot
you want to sunbathe in?

515
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Sunbathe? It's already so hot now.

516
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,420
Mr. Song.

517
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,420
Do you like fishing?

518
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,390
Why don't we fish?

519
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,140
Fishing?

520
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,660
Not a bad idea.

521
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,380
I like fishing.

522
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,420
Are we there yet, babe?

523
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,580
What's wrong with you?

524
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,500
What is this?

525
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,860
I won't look at any other ladies
but you.

526
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,480
You're getting too into it.

527
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,540
Take it.

528
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,780
Hey guys.

529
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,380
Hello.

530
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,460
You're here.

531
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,780
You're here.

532
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,780
There are three guys.

533
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,900
Four girls.

534
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,940
Not fair.

535
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,180
What's not fair?

536
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,170
Why don't Lin Mu be the referee?

537
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,020
Sure.

538
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,580
Why don't we go four on one?

539
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,500
I think all four of us

540
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,020
are alright.

541
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,380
Yeah.

542
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,780
True.

543
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,460
I agree.

544
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,140
Xie Yuan, you...

545
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,300
That's decided.

546
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,060
Sure.

547
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,020
That's decided.

548
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,540
Good luck.

549
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,700
Good luck.

550
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,460
You think I'm scared? Come on.

551
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,100
One nil.

552
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,060
Xiaoli.

553
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,780
Xiaoli.

554
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,620
Xiaoli.

555
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,260
Xiaoli, are you alright?

556
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,780
What's wrong?

557
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,810
Scraped the skin.

558
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,140
Go and sit there.

559
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,580
Here.

560
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,730
It's alright. Not a big deal.

561
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,960
No. We're getting that treated.

562
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,300
It's alright.

563
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,860
Look at this.

564
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,170
It's alright. I'll be fine in no time.

565
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,180
Listen to me.

566
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Pain pain go away.

567
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,540
You think I'm a kid?

568
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,500
Look.

569
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,980
You laugh, and the pain's gone.

570
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,220
Are you tired?

571
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,500
No. Not when I'm out with you.

572
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,020
I'm not.

573
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,220
I...

574
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,580
I can't take this anymore.

575
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,420
Then you do this.

576
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,540
Just hold the rod.

577
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,260
Sure.

578
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,860
Here.

579
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,220
Hold it here.

580
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,220
Not bad.

581
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,700
My dad likes to fish.

582
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,780
You're doing what he likes.

583
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,500
Yep.

584
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,300
But I think your dad's weird today.

585
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,180
He keeps staring at me.

586
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,410
I have no idea what that means.

587
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,380
Xingchen.

588
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,300
Get me that bait.

589
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:49,660
Sure.

590
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,930
Hold tight.

591
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,730
Here you go.

592
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,660
One question.

593
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,860
Can we really get a fish like this?

594
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,300
Fishing requires patience.

595
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:16,940
Okay.

596
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,590
Oh, I got one.

597
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,130
Here, I'll help you.

598
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,850
I have a feeling

599
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,930
this is a big one.

600
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,420
Careful.

601
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,390
Pull it in, pull it in.

602
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,940
Man.

603
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,940
Oh, what a big fish.

604
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,420
Are you laughing at me, Su Qingche?

605
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,700
No. I wouldn't dare.

606
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,140
There should be crabs too.

607
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,240
Look. There are crabs there.

608
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,620
This is a big one.

609
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,460
Here.

610
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,100
Get up here.

611
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
I'll take a pic.

612
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,740
Jianguo.

613
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:03,660
- Xingchen.
- Qingche.

614
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,460
Jianguo!

615
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:05,980
Dad.

616
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,260
Mom, call the rescue team.

617
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,260
Okay.

618
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,540
What's the number?

619
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,340
No signal.

620
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,100
Jianguo!

621
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,980
Qingche!

622
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,340
- Jianguo.
- Dad.

623
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,140
Dad!

624
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,300
Jianguo.

625
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,140
Dad.

626
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,270
CPR. Let's do it together.

627
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,380
Okay.

628
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,540
Jianguo.

629
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,940
I'll do it.

630
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,980
Jianguo.

631
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,860
Mr. Song.

632
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,860
Jianguo.

633
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,780
Jianguo.

634
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,140
You scared me.

635
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,180
You scared me.

636
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,900
It's alright now.

637
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,730
(Emergency)

638
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,720
There are stairs there.

639
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,410
I'll do it.

640
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,060
Take it slow.

641
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,660
Okay.

642
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,100
Mrs. Song.

643
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:43,900
Don't worry.

644
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,340
Mr. Song has regained consciousness.

645
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:45,870
It's alright.

646
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,460
Good thing you were there, Su.

647
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,060
If it weren't for you,

648
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,540
we'd have no idea

649
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,060
what to do.

650
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,820
Thanks for saving my husband.

651
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,180
And now,

652
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,580
I leave Xingchen in your hands.

653
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,020
With you taking care of her,

654
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,980
I have nothing to worry.

655
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,260
(Emergency Room)

656
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,500
How's my father, doctor?

657
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,820
Yeah, how is he?

658
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,190
Good thing he received
emergency care in time,

659
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,370
or he'd be in trouble.

660
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,300
One day of rest,

661
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,700
and he can go home.

662
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,780
Thank you.

663
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,540
(Qingyin.)

664
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,750
(You must've waited a long time.)

665
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,580
(No, not at all.)

666
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,660
This shoot isn't bad.

667
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,540
From my experience,

668
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,300
there's something between these two.

669
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,220
You follow gossip everywhere.

670
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,540
Why'd you come?

671
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,960
We're watching your production.

672
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,980
Not bad.

673
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,180
Let me tell you something.

674
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,850
I want to join the rescue team.

675
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,900
I thought you were in new media
or something.

676
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,690
Can you keep up with our
training intensity?

677
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,000
You're looking down on me.

678
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,270
I have a four-pack.

679
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,990
Just four-pack fewer than you guys.

680
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,260
I think I can do it.

681
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,160
Did you get triggered or something?

682
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,300
No questions. Yes or no?

683
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,580
Honestly,

684
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,960
you should ask your uncle for that.

685
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,750
He calls the shots.

686
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,100
Captain Su.

687
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
I have to ask.

688
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,500
Why do you want to join the rescue team?

689
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,060
I think it's cool.

690
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,860
I want to get stronger.

691
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,140
The rescue team
is a charity organization.

692
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,370
Training people requires money.

693
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,940
If you want to do this just because
you think it's cool

694
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,160
and only come to play,

695
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,660
I can't approve this.

696
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,660
Are you sure?

697
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,500
Sure.

698
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,260
When I get back, I'll tell Song Xingchen

699
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
you're not helping me.

700
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,780
I'll help if you have anything else,

701
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,980
but not this.

702
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,580
Fine.

703
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,470
I'll remember this.

704
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,780
Qiancheng.

705
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,180
Newbie training is in one week.

706
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,620
We can take another person.

707
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,180
Why'd you cross your nephew?

708
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,700
Because of my principles.

709
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:07,940
Sure.

710
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,700
Don't come to me
if you run into trouble.

711
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,060
Aunt Xingchen.

712
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,460
Aunt Xingchen.

713
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,100
Aunt Xingchen.

714
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,820
Aunt Xingchen.

715
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,180
You have to help me.

716
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,100
Su hasn't even married you yet.

717
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,460
I bet he'll bully us.

718
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,580
What now?

719
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,660
Just tell me if you're my aunt.

720
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,100
What do you want from me?

721
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,530
I want to join
the rescue team's training.

722
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,100
But Su Qingche wouldn't let me.

723
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,380
He's prejudiced against me.

724
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,580
I supported Tang before
for your own good.

725
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,220
He's so petty.

726
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,300
Weird.

727
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,220
They're usually welcoming to newbies.

728
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,260
Why did he refuse you?

729
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,060
No.

730
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,460
How did you bring it up to him?

731
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,500
I told him I thought the rescue team
was cool.

732
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,060
I...

733
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,580
He wasn't wrong.

734
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,180
If it were me,

735
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,460
I'd refuse you too.

736
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,420
You aren't even married to him yet,

737
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,490
and you're taking his side?

738
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,660
Tell me the truth.

739
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,820
Why did you want to join
the rescue team?

740
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,660
Because of a girl.

741
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,580
Who?

742
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,890
Not important.

743
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,630
The important thing

744
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,880
is that aside from photography,

745
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,700
I know nothing.

746
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,340
I can't swim.

747
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,730
I can't hike.

748
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,690
Not like the rescue team.
They can do everything.

749
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,680
Eight-packs.

750
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,140
I'm far from them.

751
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,020
I can't believe

752
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,860
you could say something like that.

753
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,860
Besides,

754
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,020
you join the rescue team every day,

755
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,140
so I have to follow you

756
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,220
and contribute to society.

757
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,700
If you really want to join them,

758
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,740
it's an easy problem to solve.

759
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,100
How?

760
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,340
You're here.

761
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,460
Why didn't you call?

762
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,580
I know you're leading the training.

763
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,740
So you're done now?

764
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,740
Is this about joining the team again?

765
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,020
I told you, no.

766
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,400
(Letter of Promise:
Qiancheng, Aug 17th, 2022)

767
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,940
I promise

768
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,900
once I join the training,

769
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,940
I will finish it to the best
of my abilities.

770
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,580
I will not be late or return early.

771
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,840
I will not give up.

772
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,220
What is it again?

773
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,820
Um...

774
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,500
Stop talking. It sounds fake.

775
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,860
No.

776
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,580
This is from the bottom
of my heart.

777
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
If you really want to join,

778
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,720
you'll have to pass the team's training

779
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,300
like everyone else.

780
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,740
Understand?

781
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,100
Yes, no problem.

782
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Okay.

783
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,380
Run five kilometers.

784
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,100
Finish it, and I'll consider
your application.

785
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:57,860
Okay.

786
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,190
You have a deal.

787
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,220
(Letter of Promise)

788
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,820
The handwriting is horrible.

789
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,580
You sure that kind of running is okay?

790
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,530
Don't break him.

791
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,420
If he can't endure this,
he can't join us.

792
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,700
I'm not making this hard for him.

793
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,860
I just want to see his determination.

794
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:43,940
Sure.

795
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,460
You're strict.

796
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,620
Hey, man.

797
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,180
You haven't even run a thousand meters
after high school.

798
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,210
Don't push yourself.

799
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,060
I can do this.

800
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,380
Not bad.

801
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,220
Finally done.

802
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,940
About on par

803
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,000
with the ladies' golden years group.

804
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,220
I can train,

805
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,540
but you promised

806
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,700
you'd take me if I finished that run.

807
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,020
Tell me again

808
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,610
why you want to join us?

809
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,180
Besides my personal reason,

810
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,360
I want to apologize for my
earlier attitude.

811
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,310
Now that I chose to join the training,

812
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,060
I want to contribute for charity.

813
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,730
Add another to the list of trainees
tomorrow.

814
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,470
Sure thing.

815
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,140
Really?

816
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,740
But I'm still worried about you.

817
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,580
It's hard.

818
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,300
Don't worry.

819
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,850
If everyone can do it,

820
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,820
I can do it too.

821
00:36:59,260 --> 00:36:59,980
But

822
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,740
don't show mercy to me.

823
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,780
You think I would?

824
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,220
Come.

825
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,540
Water.

826
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
Isn't this yesterday's?

827
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,900
Forget it.

828
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,820
Anything to eat? Cake?

829
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,940
What's wrong?

830
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,340
Nothing again?

831
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,740
You're back to your old self?

832
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,900
Forgot to tell Qiancheng
you had a shooting today.

833
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,900
What?

834
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,940
Nothing.

835
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,620
I...

836
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,940
I forgot to prepare

837
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,180
last night.

838
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,460
Tell me the truth.

839
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,420
Come on.

840
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:56,900
Fine.

841
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,460
To tell you the truth,

842
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,180
all the stuff at the shooting venue

843
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,420
was prepared by Qiancheng.

844
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,740
He told me not to tell you.
