Hey, Xingchen.

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,620
I can hear you.

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,060
What do you mean?

35
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,340
What's the situation?

36
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,940
Have they found him?

37
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,660
Not yet.

38
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,420
There's a storm tonight.

I'm fine.

43
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,580
Don't panic.

44
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,900
They're experienced.

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,910
Nothing's going to happen.

46
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,540

He fell in the mountains.

to treat head injury.

57
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
You need to take him into
the town hospital.

58

We took this from the patient's hand.

71

He's been holding on to this.

72
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,380
It should be important for him.

73
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,180
Su Qingche's family.

74
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,860
You must be Su Qingche's family.

75
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,480
- You sent him here, didn't you?
- Yes.

76
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,300
Good thing you sent him here in time.

77
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,580
The current diagnosis

78
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,300
is that he has acute epidural hematoma.

79
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,810
We suggest he undergo surgery
immediately.

80
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,100
You're his next of kin, right?

81
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,580
I...

82
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,780
I'm his fiancee.

83
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,660
We need his next of kin to come here
and sign the papers immediately.

84
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,900
The surgery has risks.

85
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
We need to tell his next of kin
face to face.

86
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,460
Um...

87
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,900
They're on their way.

88
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,870
Can I sign the papers and you
start the surgery?

89
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,180
Doctor.

90
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,140
Doctor.

91
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,660
I...

92
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,060
Grandpa.

93

Hey.

Where did Qingche get hurt?

96
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,220
How is it? Is it serious?

97
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,860
You're his grandfather, yes?

98
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,460
Yes.

99
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,140
Then you're his next of kin.

100
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,700
The current diagnosis for your grandson

101
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,980
is acute epidural hematoma.

102
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,410
He needs to go through surgery
immediately.

103
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,500
We need his next of kin

104
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
to sign here on this surgery agreement.

105
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,620
You're his next of kin.

106
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,020
Go through the agreement.

107
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,500
Um...

108
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,340
It's fine.

109
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,380
Okay.

110
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,900
Okay.

111
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,610
We'll prepare the surgery right now.

112
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,060
Okay.

113
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,440
(Operating Room)

114
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,860
How is it?

115
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
The surgery went well.

116
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,880
But the patient hasn't regained
consciousness.

117
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,810
He needs to be kept under watch
twenty-four hours.

118
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,340
We'll move him to the ICU.

119
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,980
Okay. Thank you.

(Operating Room)

121
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,100
(You're still not asleep?)

122
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,460
You're hurt.

123
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,900
Where are you?

124
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,100
(I got into an accident in the mountains.)

125
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm in the hospital.

126
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,140
See?

127
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,660
Right.

128
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,140
(Qingche's hurt too.)

129
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
(But Dr. Song is with him.)

130
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
What's his injury?

131
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,060
His head got hurt.

132
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,220
He went through surgery.

133
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
We're waiting for him to wake.

134
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,680
His grandpa's here too. It's alright.

135
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,100
What about you?

136
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,780
Are you alright?

137
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,900
(I...)

138
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,780
(Are you worried about me?)

139
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,940
Yes.

140
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,510
I am worried about you.

141
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,620
(So you aren't mad?)

142
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,540
I am worried sick about you.

143
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,420
You might have lost a limb.

144
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Or maybe you got hurt

145
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,020
and no one tends to you.

146
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:45,940
I'm worried...

147
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,180
that you might never come back.

148
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,820
(Really?)

149
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,180
(Can you say that again?)

150
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,980
I don't say good things twice.

151
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
That's all I have to say.

152
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,340
Figure out it yourself.

153
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,220
(Hey, no.)

154
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,210
I'll get a flight ticket now
and get back, babe.

155
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,380
Right now.

156
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,060
Do that if you dare.

157
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,780
Don't be in a hurry.

158
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,780
(Don't get mad, then.)

159
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,060
(Wait for me.)

160
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,980
Don't think just because you're hurt

161
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,980
I will let the thing with the phone slide.

162
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,780
Explain yourself after you come back.

163
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,380
Or else,

164
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,700
you'll lose me forever.

165
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,780
(Hey, don't.)

166
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,460
(Don't worry, once I get back,)

167
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,420
(I'll explain everything.)

168
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,380
You get some rest.

169
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,500
Talk later.

170
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,140
Bye.

171
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,820
You get some rest too.

172
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,180
(ICU)

173
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,260
We need to check on the patient.

174
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,820
Please leave.

175
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,100
Come back later.

176
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,420
Doctor.

177
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,340
How's Su Qingche?

178
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,020
His vitals are normal.

179
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,580
He should have awoken.

180
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,620
It can't be diffuse axonal injury.

181
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,010
Keep him for one more day.

182
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,110
Then we'll have to switch hospitals.

183
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,140
While you still have time now,

184
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,180
stay with him.

185
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,460
Talk to him.

186
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,540
I see. Thank you, doctor.

187
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,460
It's my job.

188
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,820
Qingche.

189
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,340
I haven't seen you for so long.

190
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,220
You were full of life

191
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,500
on the phone a few days ago.

192
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,420
Why are you lying
in the hospital bed now?

193
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,940
You know, the day you were sent in,

194
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,860
I wished I could sign the papers for you.

195
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,380
You think

196
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,100
I made the wrong decision too,
didn't you?

197
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,110
I think I made the wrong decision too.

198
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,940
I'm thinking maybe it's because

199
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,900
you give me too much sense of security.

200
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,060
That's why

201
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
I never realized

202
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,900
our meeting

203
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,700
keeps getting delayed for reasons.

204
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,980
We missed so much time together.

205
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,980
You're mad at me, aren't you?

206
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:15,980
That's why

207
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,820
you're doing this to me.

208
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,220
You want me to regret this.

209
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,460
You want me to regret

210
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,780
never treasuring the time
I had with you.

211
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,020
I do regret it. I regret it now.

212
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,220
So please, I beg you,

213
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,140
wake up, okay?

214
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,460
Please give me a chance
to make it up to you.

215
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,700
Please.

216
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,300
Qingche.

217
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,100
Please.

218
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,540
I beg you.

219
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,860
Wake up.

220
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,420
You're awake.

221
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,100
How do you feel?

222
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,420
I'll get the doctor.

223
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,100
Xingchen.

224
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,540
I thought I'd never see you again.

225
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,180
I'm sorry

226
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,700
for worrying you.

227
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,460
Don't cry.

228
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,500
Don't cry.

229
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,940
Where's the necklace I gave you?

230
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,880
Are you wearing it?

231
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,180
I am.

232
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,980
Sorry.

233
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,860
I lost my necklace.

234
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,420
Your ring's with me.

235
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,340
I'll help you wear it.

236
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,620
Hold on.

237
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,740
You should leave that chance to me.

238
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:02,900
Sure.

239
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,340
It's good having you here.

240
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,410
I don't want to be separated
from you again.

241
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,220
We'll never separate.

242
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:47,940
Here.

243
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,900
Have a banana.

244
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,380
I just ate.

245
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,400
- I can't have any more food.
- No, you're eating this.

246
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,140
The doctor said

247
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,300
you're out for so long

248
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,260
because you're too weak
and haven't rested well.

249
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,380
I am not weak.

250
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,340
Shut it. I get to decide that, not you.

251
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,580
Eat it.

252
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,620
I am not.

253
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,900
Just one bite.

254
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,220
One bite.

255
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,900
I'll have it later.

256
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,460
You actually just had one bite?

257
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,260
Scared now?

258
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,340
I am worried about you.

259
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,220
But I believe in you, Captain Su.

260
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,340
Qingche.

261
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm sorry.

262
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,900
What's there to apologize for?

263
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,540
After this time,

264
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,380
I realized how serious things are.

265
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,660
I feel

266
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,620
that the path ahead of us is long.

267
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,180
There's today,

268
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
then tomorrow,

269
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,940
and the day after, then after that.

270
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,580
After you go back to Haicheng,

271
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,300
we'll get married.

272
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,740
Sure.

273
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,860
Qingche.

274
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,140
I'm here. You still alive?

275
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,570
Sorry. Keep doing
what you were doing.

276
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Mind the wound.

293
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,740
Hello?

294
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,140
(What's wrong with you?)

295
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,220
Su Qingche and Lu Qun are out
on a mission. They aren't free.

296
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,860
Why didn't you tell me you came back?

297
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,100
I would've picked you up.

298
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,420
Alright, babe.

299
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
You're expecting.

300
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,820
Don't run around. It's unsafe.

301
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,340
I don't care.

302
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,900
You're being a stranger.

303
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,220
Now I'm mad.

304
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,340
Your pregnancy hormone levels
are spiking high.

305
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,500
How's Stardust Rouge doing lately?

306
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,740
We broke even

307
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,140
and made tons of profit.

308
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,660
Now it's turn to prepare
the shop's celebration.

309
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,420
Sure, no problem.

310
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,900
But I have to go to the hospital
and report in.

311
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,460
Which hospital this time?

312
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,060
The City People's Hospital.

313
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,460
It's close to my home.

314
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,260
I'll be waiting for you

315
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,810
to shine brightly in the medical field,

316
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,940
Dr. Song.

317
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,940
Thanks for the blessing.

318
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,580
Bye.

319
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,600
(Vacant)

320
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm finally back.

321
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,980
You're back.

322
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
I'm back.

323
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,620
Did you

324
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,460
set this up over the last two years?

325
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,300
During your absence,

326
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,740
I saved every single thing
you posted to your Moments.

327
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,100
Even when we video call,

328
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,380
I'd snapshot in secret too.

329
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,580
Because

330
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,620
even when we're not together,

331
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,940
we shouldn't miss the moments

332
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,820
in each other's lives.

333
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,700
I recorded everything.

334
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,100
Look.

335
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,580
This picture

336
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,860
was taken the first time

337
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,280
you took part in a surgery overseas.

338
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,420
That surgery took more than ten hours.

339
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,500
When you were sleeping,

340
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,060
the mask's mark on your nose

341
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,220
was still there.

342
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,540
And this one.

343
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,580
One time when I was on a mission,

344
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,340
I told you my stomach was protesting.

345
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,540
You got me delivery.

346
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,060
Then when I looked into it,

347
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,660
you got me gastric pills
and pills for all kinds of stuff.

348
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,910
The delivery guy
thought I was down with a lot of stuff.

349
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,220
You were so worried.

350
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,700
And this one.

351
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,300
When I looked up that day,

352
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,580
I saw the stars.

353
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,820
I thought it looked nice.

354
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,420
So I wondered,

355
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,180
if you

356
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,500
were also looking at the sky.

357
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,900
The same sky as me.

358
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,540
No matter where,

359
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,540
as long as we look up,

360
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,820
we will see the same sky.

361
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,780
The same stars.

362
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,940
Why are you staring at me like that?

363
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,140
I want to look at you.

364
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,540
Why?

365
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,460
I want to see if there are any changes

366
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,180
I don't know.

367
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,860
Maybe a few strands of gray hair.

368
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,700
And also,

369
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,020
my cooking's not that good anymore.

370
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,480
Since you weren't around,
I couldn't be bothered to cook.

371
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,900
But the thing that never changed

372
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,980
is this.

373
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,220
I never want to be apart from you
anymore.

374
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,500
I want to be with you.

375
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,500
Okay.

376
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,900
We'll be together forever.

377
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,860
Welcome home.

378
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,980
(After so many twists and turns,)

379
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,820
(I came back to my roots.)

380
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,340
(Good medical skills)

381
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,420
(make the first step
into the hall of medicine.)

382
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,220
(I have a long road ahead of me.)

383
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:18,020
(Stardust Rouge's three-year anniversary)

384
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,740
Esteemed guests,

385
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,100
friends from media,

386
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,300
good afternoon.

387
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,620
Welcome to Stardust Rouge's

388
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,260
three-year anniversary.

389
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,660
I am your host, Gao Qingyin.

390
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,900
The host we got last minute
is doing well.

391
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,700
Of course.

392
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,940
She's my girlfriend.

393
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,900
You're nervous.

394
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,140
You know

395
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,500
how I am with stages.

396
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,340
And there are ton of people here.

397
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,700
Can I just leave everything to you guys?

398
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,580
Yeah, right.

399
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,650
Be a good girl.

400
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,620
And now, let us welcome

401
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
Stardust Rouge's founder,

402
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,700
Ms. Han Xiaoli and Ms. Song Xingchen
to the stage.

403
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,100
Good luck. Let's go.

404
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,540
Let's go.

405
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,620
First,

406
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,540
I'd like to thank everyone
for coming here.

407
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,620
Today is a special day

408
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,220
for Stardust Rouge.

409
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,660
When I first made this company,

410
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,420
I honestly

411
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,700
did not think it'd last this long.

412
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,380
I never thought

413
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,260
it would grow

414
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,540
until what it is today.

415
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,020
I'm lucky to have met Xingchen.

416
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,900
She stood up for me

417
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,500
and fought with me

418
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,570
during Stardust Rouge's darkest hour.

419
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,300
She led its transformation
to completion.

420
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,340
She led it through obstacles.

421
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,460
Without Xingchen,

422
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,740
Stardust Rouge would've fallen
three years ago.

423
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,700
And now,

424
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,220
I might

425
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,020
still be the same cowardly

426
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,260
Han Xiaoli who doesn't have the courage

427
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,220
to face life's difficulties.

428
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,260
Xingchen.

429
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,700
I hope I can be someone you can rely on.

430
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,500
I hope I can stand with you

431
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,300
and move on to the next stage in life.

432
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
Don't worry.

433
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,700
I'll always be with you.

434
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
We'll go shopping,

435
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,740
unpack all the deliveries,

436
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,340
and complain about your husband.

437
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,060
So Lu Qun,

438
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,540
you better be careful.

439
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,940
I'll always have my eyes on you.

440
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Me too.

441
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,900
Stardust Rouge was created

442
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,980
for that girls help girls.

443
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,540
Since the beginning,

444
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,180
Xiaoli has been the one supporting me.

445
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,020
No matter my resignation,

446
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,660
studying abroad,

447
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,500
my pursuit of love,

448
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,460
she has been by my side,

449
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,540
giving me strength.

450
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,740
Why are you everywhere?

451
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,680
Doesn't your girlfriend
keep an eye on you?

452
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,140
Sorry, I forgot.

453
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,220
You haven't found someone yet.

454
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,010
I'd rather put quality before quantity.

455
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,780
Mind your own business, Captain Su.

456
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,700
When I was twenty-nine,

457
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,660
I quit my private hospital job.

458
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,240
Then I joined Stardust Rouge.

459
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,380
Back then,

460
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,860
(I came up)

461
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,380
(with a lot of plans for myself.)

462
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,700
(I always thought)

463
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,020
(that as long as I completed my plans,)

464
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,300
(my life would be perfect.)

465
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,580
But today, I realize

466
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,900
the thing that gives me safety

467
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,060
and happiness

468
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,620
isn't the completion

469
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,420
of my plans,

470
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,140
but the right people I met

471
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,220
along the way.

472
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,100
So I hope everyone

473
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,020
can find the truest friendship

474
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,480
and the most perfect relationship.

475
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,620
And I hope everyone
will go forward

476
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,300
no matter what, just like Stardust Rouge.

477
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,020
- Good.
- Good.

478
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,180
So how do you feel now?

479
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,020
I will tell the whole world

480
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,820
Song Xingchen is my girlfriend.

481
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,500
I'm hers.

482
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,260
Xingchen didn't make the wrong choice.

483
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,300
Su Qingche.

484
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,900
I wish you guys

485
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,180
lifelong happiness.

486
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,980
Thanks for the blessing.

487
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,100
Don't worry.

488
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,740
I won't let you down.

489
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,620
Nor will I let her down.

490
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,630
(Stardust Rouge's three-year anniversary)

491
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,900
You take Xiaoli and get some rest.

492
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,900
I'll serve the guests.

493
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,500
Sure. Go.

494
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,500
Be careful.

495
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,060
Sure.

496
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,500
I'll hold you.

497
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,060
Slowly.

498
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,660
Okay.

499
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,020
Mr. Liang.

500
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,780
Ms. Song, congratulations.

501
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,260
You're a CEO now.

502
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,670
Congratulations.

503
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
Thanks for coming.

504
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,900
You guys go ahead.

505
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,540
I have work to do at school.

506
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,350
I'll get busy now.

507
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,510
I'll send him off.

508
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,100
Sure.

509
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,220
Qiancheng.

510
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,340
Where's Su Qingche?

511
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,140
I didn't see him.

512
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,340
He was here a while ago.

513
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,900
Now can I borrow some of your time?

514
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,580
What's mine is yours.

515
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,620
Sure you can.

516
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,880
What are you doing?

517
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,500
Why did we

518
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,060
come here?

519
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,260
Do you remember this place?

520
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,740
Of course.

521
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,780
That was my first time getting stood up.

522
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,140
It was right here.

523
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,740
Right here,

524
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,570
I kissed you for the first time.

525
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
It's still the same here.

526
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,300
The flowers bloom again.

527
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,460
Song Xingchen.

528
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,300
Actually,

529
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,220
when I saw you speaking on the stage,

530
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,140
I have something I want to tell you.

531
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,060
You are my pride.

532
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,980
It's always been that way.

533
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,820
You're confident,

534
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,460
decisive,

535
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,780
unyielding,

536
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,540
kind,

537
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,340
and brave.

538
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,780
All the praises for people

539
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
and women

540
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,260
manifest in you.

541
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,500
True love means

542
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,980
pushing your lover
to be the best version of themselves.

543
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,260
You did it, Captain Su.

544
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,100
When I fell down the mountains,

545
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
I was terrified.

546
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,180
I was worried

547
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,380
I might never have the chance
to protect you again.

548
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,540
Maybe life after this

549
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,500
won't be as nice as we imagine,

550
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,140
and maybe bad things will happen,

551
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,940
but with you around, I'm not scared.

552
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,900
I hope I can be the one

553
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,940
by your side until the end.

554
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,500
Can I have that chance?

555
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,620
Song Xingchen.

556
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,260
This is the most important affair
in my life.

557
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,020
Will you marry me?

558
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,960
♪Following your direction,
filled with fantasies♪

559
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,850
♪Days become lengthy,
the world is forgotten♪

560
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,100
When Song Xingchen has Su Qingche,

561
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,260
she has a home.

562
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,060
I never had to order delivery

563
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,020
and do the dishes.

564
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,220
Life

565
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,820
is made

566
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,300
of all the little satisfactions.
