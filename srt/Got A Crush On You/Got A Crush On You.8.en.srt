=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 8=

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,540
(The gas station's up ahead.)

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,580
(Let's take a short break
before we start out trip.)

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,180
Fill up the tank with 95, please.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,580
You go ahead. I'll stay.

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,060
Okay.

29
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,340
Here, have some water.

30
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,450
I think we can get there before dark.

31
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,980
(Filling station)

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,820
Alright.

33
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,780
The tank's filled up.

34
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,500
Let's go.

35
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,060
Let's go.

36
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,900
Looks like it's going to rain.

37
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,140
We're still about an hour away.

38
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,820
Let's hurry.

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Okay.

40
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,300
Lots of fallen rocks here.

41
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,660
Cars behind, watch out.

42
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
The road ahead is rough.

43
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,900
(Drivers, stay focused)

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,940
(and keep the cars steady.)

45
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,220
(Keep the vaccines from shaking.)

46
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Roger that.

47
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,380
Drive slowly.

48
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,260
What rotten luck.

49
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,620
We're caught in this bad weather.

50
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,900
This rain isn't stopping any time soon.

51
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,020
The vaccines have limited shelf life.

52
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,660
Let's hurry.

53
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,620
Get the vaccines there

54
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,870
while the road's still passable.

55
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,380
Okay.

56
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,180
What's the matter?

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
What's happening?

58
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,500
There's a landslide ahead.

59
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,420
The road is blocked.

60
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,100
What do we do?

61
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,100
Stop, everyone.

62
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,900
We'll check it out.

63
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,260
Roger that.

64
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,420
Cars can't pass through. Now what?

65
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,670
How far are we from the village?

66
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
I just checked.
About 15 kilometers.

67
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,340
We'll foot it.

68
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,540
What?

69
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,020
Isn't it too risky with the rockfall

70
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,820
and this downpour?

71
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,660
What are we here for?

72
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,940
We've come this far.

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,940
Should we give up?

74
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,740
Okay.

75
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,660
Everyone.

76
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,220
(There's a landslide ahead.)

77
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,500
(Cars can't pass anymore.)

78
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,940
(Let's pack up.)

79
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,900
(We'll trek on foot.)

80
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,540
Let's go, everyone.

81
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,540
Each do our part.

82
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,560
- Let me do it.
- Okay.

83
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,460
I'll take this.

84
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,700
I'll take it.

85
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,900
Is there anyone else?

86
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,300
Let me help you.

87
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,940
Thanks, but it's okay.

88
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,100
No need to take this.

89
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,380
It's better to travel light.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,620
Although chickenpox vaccines
are quite well tolerated,

91
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,820
we need to be prepared.

92
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,020
In case anyone

93
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,580
shows adverse reactions to the vaccine,

94
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,380
these emergency meds can be useful.

95
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,420
Okay, let's go.

96
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,620
Let's go.

97
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,980
Wait a second.

98
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,460
- It's done.
- Let me help you with it.

99
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:50,900
Okay.

100
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,020
Why are you staring at me?

101
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,580
Captain Su.

102
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,740
This is no time for narcissism, right?

103
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,700
I'm just stating the facts.

104
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,309
As the one concerned,

105
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,989
I have the right
to rebut your accusation.

106
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,530
It's hard to trek the mountains
in the rain.

107
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,560
Be more careful next time.

108
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:11,020
Thanks.

109
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,820
Everyone.

110
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,780
The only road to the village

111
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
is now blocked.

112
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,220
We're about 15 kilometers
away from there.

113
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,820
We'll have to get there on foot.

114
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,060
Be careful, everyone.

115
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,140
Don't fall behind.

116
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,700
Ensure the safety of yourselves

117
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,340
and the vaccines.

118
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,300
I hope everyone

119
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,020
can move faster than during our training

120
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,260
so that the vaccines
reach the village safely on time.

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,100
Got it?

122
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,020
Got it.

123
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,900
Let's go.

124
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,980
Come on, everyone.

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,340
We're almost there.

126
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,740
Are you from Polar Night Rescue?

127
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,180
Yes.

128
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,700
Yes, we are.

129
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,340
Sorry for the delay.

130
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,260
It was raining heavily,

131
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,160
and the road's blocked.

132
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,580
Thank you so much for coming.

133
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,100
Come on, let's enter our village.

134
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,660
Let's enter our village.

135
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,180
Let's go.

136
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,740
Captain Su.

137
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,340
Captain Su.

138
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,460
Morning, Chief.

139
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,940
Morning.

140
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,860
You're up so early.

141
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,060
Why don't you get more sleep?

142
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,890
No, I'm used to it.

143
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,300
Here, grab a bite.

144
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,180
Is this for us?

145
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,780
Yeah.

146
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,460
Thank you.

147
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,460
This is so nice of you.

148
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,020
How are the vaccines?

149
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,740
We've contacted the Health Department.

150
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,700
We can start vaccinations from today.

151
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,500
Don't worry.

152
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,700
Good to hear that.

153
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,460
Captain Su.

154
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,940
You have no idea.

155
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,260
In our village,

156
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,460
we have some old villagers

157
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,220
who live in the old village
in the mountains.

158
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,220
They rarely come out.

159
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,620
Getting them down here for vaccination

160
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,060
is practically impossible.

161
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,260
So, what you're saying is...

162
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,540
Say, can you

163
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,580
get your team's doctor

164
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,820
to take some of the vaccines
to the old village

165
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,340
in the mountains

166
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,940
with our clinic's doctor

167
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,620
to help get them vaccinated?

168
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
How many are they?

169
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,420
Around a dozen or so.

170
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay, I'll arrange it.

171
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,500
Thank you so much for this.

172
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,820
I'll let Chen know about it.

173
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,300
Eat it while it's hot.

174
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,380
Thank you.

175
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,740
Oh no.

176
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,020
What's wrong?

177
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,460
Are you not feeling well?

178
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,380
I got my period.

179
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,140
Do you have pads?

180
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,140
You startled us.

181
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,780
I don't.

182
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,900
Me neither.

183
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,460
Here, use a tampon.

184
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,980
A tampon?

185
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
I haven't even had a boyfriend.

186
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,700
Those rumors are mostly biased.

187
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,900
It won't hurt you.

188
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,620
Don't be afraid.

189
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,420
Give it a try.

190
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Or you could

191
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,100
ask around the village
for some normal ones.

192
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
But that'd be embarrassing.

193
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,900
I'm curious.

194
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,140
Do you usually

195
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,100
hide your pads

196
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,860
when you go to public restrooms?

197
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,340
Or we keep them in a separate bag.

198
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,460
But periods
are a normal thing for girls.

199
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,780
Why feel embarrassed about it?

200
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,540
It's our long-standing period shaming

201
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,540
that treats a normal biological process
in women

202
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,820
as a taboo.

203
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,460
I'm on my period today.

204
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,500
I'm using a tampon

205
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,220
and can still do vigorous activities.

206
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,380
It's not a big deal.

207
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,980
In fact, we should be able

208
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,060
to talk about it openly.

209
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,100
Use it.

210
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,420
Are you sure it won't
feel uncomfortable?

211
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,340
It won't, really. It's easy to use.

212
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,940
Trust me.

213
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,420
Okay.

214
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,100
Since you're using it,

215
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,700
I'll try it.

216
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,520
What's the matter?

217
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,900
There's another task.

218
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,880
Both of us need to go.

219
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,740
Okay.

220
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,020
Is it just the three of us?

221
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,220
Aren't others coming with us?

222
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,740
Vaccination is simple,

223
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,220
but if something goes wrong,

224
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,420
we'll need emergency aid.

225
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,140
Dr. Song.

226
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,660
our resources here are limited.

227
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,700
We have no other option

228
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,820
but to have you two

229
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,700
come uphill with me.

230
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,220
Okay.

231
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,980
Then let's make it quick.

232
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,700
Okay.

233
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,620
Tired?

234
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,700
It's tough,

235
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,060
but the outcome is good.

236
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm not tired.

237
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,460
Help.

238
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,820
What's wrong?

239
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,620
This is bad. This kid fainted.

240
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,380
He fainted.

241
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
Kid.

242
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,060
Don't worry, madam.

243
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,380
Leave it to the doctor.

244
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,380
His heartbeat's too slow.

245
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,500
I can barely feel his pulse.

246
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,460
Might be arrhythmia.

247
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,140
Dr. Chen, get the adrenaline ready.

248
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,300
I've never come across this before.

249
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,140
How did this happen?

250
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,380
Trust me.

251
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,700
Get a dose of atropine.

252
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,220
Okay.

253
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,660
Doctor, is he okay?

254
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,860
Atropine's here.

255
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,500
Hold on tight.

256
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,540
Press on it.

257
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,120
This is not good.

258
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,620
Prepare for CPR.

259
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,300
Let's take turns.

260
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,680
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

261
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,340
Here, keep pressure on it.

262
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,620
There's breathing.

263
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,660
Is that so?

264
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,340
Kid.

265
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,280
Kid, how do you feel?

266
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,420
Do you feel unwell?

267
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,700
It's over now.

268
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,380
Get him to the hospital downhill.

269
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,060
Okay.

270
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,060
Thank you.

271
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,620
Thank you.

272
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Hey, Liu.

273
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,320
Thanks for your hard work.

274
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,020
We're really sorry.

275
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:51,900
What happened?

276
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,270
You two will need
to spend the night in the village.

277
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,600
Part of the road
down the mountain collapsed.

278
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
We're already working on it.

279
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,260
Luckily, the kid
was already sent downhill.

280
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,340
That's a relief.

281
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,420
We prepared a room in a hurry.

282
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,500
You two lovebirds

283
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,340
can make do for one night.

284
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,380
Lovebirds?

285
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,700
No, Madam. You got the wrong idea.

286
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,540
We're not a couple.

287
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,400
Is there no other room available?

288
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,820
There is,

289
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,580
but the room's not ready.

290
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,220
It's okay, Madam.

291
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
One room is enough.

292
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,460
We're on a task.

293
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,460
No need to fuss about it.

294
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,060
We're really grateful
to both of you today.

295
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,620
Thank you so much.

296
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,180
You saved my grandson.

297
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,460
Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare.

298
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,740
Thankfully, it wasn't serious.

299
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,340
You two rest for now.

300
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,140
I'll fix you something to eat.

301
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,060
Okay, madam.

302
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,420
Alright, have a seat.

303
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,820
I'll go help her.

304
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,300
Okay.

305
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,220
Madam.

306
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,260
Let me help you.

307
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,660
No need. You had a long day.

308
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,700
Just get some rest.

309
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,460
By the way,

310
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,900
do you have any spare clothes?

311
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,580
I do.

312
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,100
After I finish cooking noodles,

313
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,220
I'll go find some for you.

314
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,940
Okay.

315
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,700
These are for my son
and daughter-in-law.

316
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,500
Please wear these for now.

317
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,940
Did you boil the water?

318
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,060
You had a long day.

319
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,920
Just take a hot bath.

320
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,940
This is great.

321
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,170
Finally, I can wash myself.

322
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,300
Here's the noodle
Madam cooked for you.

323
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,300
Eat it while it's hot.

324
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,640
Okay. I'll eat outside.

325
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,220
You wash first.

326
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,700
Okay.

327
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,700
What happened?

328
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,340
Sorry.

329
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,100
Don't come in.

330
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,020
Sorry.

331
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,170
Sorry, I didn't see anything.

332
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,540
Come out with me.

333
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,460
Sorry.

334
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,980
I really didn't see anything.

335
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,900
It's borrowed last minute.
Doesn't look good on me?

336
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,440
It's nice.

337
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,581
I filled a basin with water for you
before I bathed.

338
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,520
Go ahead and freshen up.

339
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,700
Thanks.

340
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,540
It fits you nicely.

341
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,780
Is that so?

342
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,500
You look very much like a village beau.

343
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,100
Village belle,
you don't look bad, either.

344
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,620
Mine has a festive vibe.

345
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,100
Full of joy and liveliness.

346
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,300
The air is so fresh here.

347
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,260
How beautiful.

348
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
You're smiling at last.

349
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,220
What's wrong?

350
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,380
Something's been off with you

351
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
ever since you came back
from that school event.

352
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Did something happen?

353
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,540
Can you tell me about it?

354
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,980
I used to work at a private hospital.

355
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,820
The noble practice of medicine

356
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,700
shouldn't be about meeting quotas,

357
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,860
but it's not up for me to decide

358
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,020
or change them.

359
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,420
I don't belong there.

360
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,980
So, I quit.

361
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,580
Later, I saw Xiaoli's store

362
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,340
on the verge of closure,

363
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,100
so I used my savings

364
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,465
and became her partner.

365
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,940
If we're doing this,

366
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,220
we have to do it well.

367
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,900
I was planning to pursue a PhD.

368
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,170
But on the day of the school event,

369
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,020
my professor told me

370
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,220
that the old professor
in my desired field

371
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,260
won't be taking students this year

372
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,180
for health reasons.

373
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,900
That's why I was upset.

374
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,300
So, what are your plans

375
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,620
after this?

376
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,660
After this,

377
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,860
I'll run the store

378
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,140
while preparing for exams,

379
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,220
juggling both.

380
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,060
Coming to this village today

381
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,500
suddenly revived my long-lost sense

382
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,380
of achievement as a doctor.

383
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,420
It also reminded me

384
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,940
of why I studied medicine back then.

385
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,660
Sometimes,

386
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,580
when walking on a path alone,

387
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,660
it's easy to forget

388
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,820
why you took the first step.

389
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,580
Thank you

390
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,380
for making me more determined.

391
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,260
Congratulations.

392
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,540
You've rediscovered yourself.

393
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,900
Why is there a leak?

394
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,260
This is an old house.

395
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,500
It will leak even more
if it rains heavily.

396
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,340
There's no one at home to fix it,

397
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,740
so I can only use a basin
to catch the water.

398
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,500
It's fine.

399
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,040
I'll fix it for you when the rain stops.

400
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,780
Thank you.

401
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,340
I'll help you.

402
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,460
Let me help you.

403
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,140
Watch your step.

404
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,420
Give me the mud.

405
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,220
Hold onto the ladder.

406
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,180
Don't worry.

407
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,900
You're injured.

408
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,800
Let's go to a hospital.

409
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,860
It's okay. No need.

410
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,920
Such an injury
has a high risk of tetanus infection.

411
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,820
You have to go.

412
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
I don't need for a tetanus shot.

413
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,820
Can I refuse?

414
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,580
No, you can't.

415
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,380
(Haicheng Hospital)

416
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,140
I refuse.

417
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,919
If it's not treated properly,

418
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,580
it could be very serious,
so listen to me.

419
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,580
It's fine. I'll just

420
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,100
head back and disinfect it myself.

421
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,820
Do you know how people die from tetanus?

422
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,040
You might end up paralyzed.

423
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,260
The infection rate of tetanus

424
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,010
is only one
to two percent when contracted.

425
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,970
Breakouts include difficulty swallowing,
choking,

426
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,560
incontinence, and sudden cardiac arrest.

427
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,620
Let's go. I refuse.

428
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,180
Sit down.

429
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,374
Are you afraid of needles?

430
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,339
No way.

431
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,500
How could I be afraid of that?

432
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,120
Are you kidding?

433
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,019
Will you take the shot?

434
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,260
I still have rounds to do later.

435
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,180
I won't take the shot.

436
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,340
Qingche.

437
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,860
I heard they're giving you a...

438
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,620
You're here.

439
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,740
(Is he afraid of needles?)

440
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,620
Pretty lady.

441
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,740
We have something to discuss.

442
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,100
Why don't you come back later?

443
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,100
Be quick.

444
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,740
Got it. No problem.

445
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,340
Qingche.

446
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,820
If you're afraid of needles,

447
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,019
your reputation will be ruined.

448
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,920
You're good
at making fun of me now, aren't you?

449
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,979
Let go of me.

450
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,820
If she sees you now,

451
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,870
she won't feel bad for you.

452
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:13,670
If I let you go now,

453
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,830
wouldn't you misunderstand me?

454
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,020
Zhou.

455
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,820
Xingchen.

456
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,460
What brings you here?

457
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,420
It's been a long while.

458
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,940
By the way,
I need your help with something.

459
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,820
Go on.

460
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,900
That patient is a relative of mine.

461
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,260
He refuses to get the shot.

462
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,140
But you know I have a medical license.

463
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,460
Alright.

464
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,180
Let go of me.

465
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,380
Are you ready?

466
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,580
Dr. Song.

467
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,100
Here.

468
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,060
You...

469
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,180
What are you doing?

470
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,500
What else can I do?

471
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,040
Of course, it's giving you a shot.

472
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Even if you're a doctor,

473
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,620
you should respect the patient's wishes.

474
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,940
I said I wouldn't take the shot.

475
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,140
Besides being a doctor,

476
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,540
I have another identity.

477
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,060
No other identity will work.

478
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,900
Really?

479
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,020
The patient's family member.

480
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,820
Does that not work, either?

481
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,660
There's only one empty slot

482
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,860
left in my family.

483
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,100
Are you thinking of filling it in?

484
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,420
Are you taking this shot or not?

485
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,740
I can't give you the shot
with you like this.

486
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,300
Take it off.

487
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,220
Are they getting it on so soon?

488
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,380
Way to go, brother.

489
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,260
Getting what on?

490
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,940
You came.

491
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,700
On their way back,

492
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,020
Xingchen told me

493
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,060
to bring over some clothes.

494
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,700
What are they doing inside?

495
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,500
They...

496
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,620
Stop.

497
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,020
Don't you want to watch them?

498
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,540
I do.

499
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,180
The assertive belle
and the rescue team captain.

500
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,220
Just thinking about it excites me.

501
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,978
What are you talking about?

502
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,220
That's how it goes in TV dramas.

503
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,660
I want to watch it live.

504
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,380
How many brainwashing

505
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,140
TV dramas have you watched?

506
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,780
Not many. Maybe a hundred or so.

507
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,860
What are you doing?

508
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,220
Didn't you tell me to take it off?

509
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,780
This is a tetanus shot.

510
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,820
The deltoid muscle will do,

511
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,100
silly.

512
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,832
Come over and sit down.

513
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,300
Hurry up.

514
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,083
I'll do it myself.

515
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,672
I'll do it.

516
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,400
Don't be nervous.

517
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,887
This is disinfectant.

518
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,980
So you are afraid of needles.

519
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,540
I am.

520
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,843
But for the sake
of that spot in my family,

521
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,180
I can overcome it.

522
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,620
Are you sure?

523
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Hurry up.

524
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
I'll do it now.

525
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,460
On the count of three.

526
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,580
Three.

527
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,700
Where's the rest?

528
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,207
Don't move.

529
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,220
Apply pressure.

530
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,020
Hold it steady.

531
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,460
You're not afraid of death

532
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,220
but are afraid of a tiny needle.

533
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
You really are something.

534
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,780
Can't I have a weakness?

535
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,860
Sure, you can,

536
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,780
but your weakness

537
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,620
is quite funny.

538
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,260
But it's cute, too.

539
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,780
Don't you think they make a good couple?

540
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,620
If you ever need a wingman,

541
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,580
just look for me.

542
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,620
Sure. No problem.

543
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,140
(Come on, Han Xiaoli.)

544
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,580
(Have you been single for too long)

545
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,938
(and are settling for just anyone?)

546
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,100
(The man before you is a playboy.)

547
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,740
Do you mean what you said earlier?

548
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,540
What did I say?

549
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,320
My family member.

550
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,340
The kind

551
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,716
where you can sign the papers

552
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,900
when I fall ill.

553
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,007
How can you believe what a woman says?

554
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,700
(Injection room)

555
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,270
It seems like the doctor
who gave you shots in your childhood

556
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,970
left you
with quite a psychological shadow.

557
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,260
How was today?

558
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,170
It didn't hurt to begin with.

559
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,100
By the way,

560
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,140
Dr. Song, you're amazing.

561
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,700
Not only did you administer the shot,

562
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,260
but you also
cured his psychological illness.

563
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,340
You stop blabbering,

564
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,020
or I'll give you a shot right now.

565
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,180
The same kind as mine.

566
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,940
I didn't expect the cool
and handsome Captain Su

567
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,420
to have such a side to him.

568
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,740
I beg you both

569
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,060
to please keep

570
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,820
this embarrassing incident secret.

571
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,620
It depends on his performance.

572
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,980
Since the results say you're fine,

573
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,120
Xiaoli and I will be leaving.

574
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,140
You two don't live together.

575
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,740
I'll send you home.

576
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,740
I'm an adult, okay?

577
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,260
Well, I'm still worried.

578
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,420
Xingchen.

579
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,140
Here's your change of clothes.

580
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,420
I just remembered

581
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,700
I left something at the store

582
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,501
and need to go back.

583
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,620
Is it urgent?

584
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,860
I happened to drive here today.

585
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,100
I'll take her there.

586
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,300
Goodbye.

587
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,740
Let's go.

588
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,316
Do you need me to support you?

589
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,820
Sure.

590
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,260
So, where is your home?

591
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,260
Drop me off
at the nearest subway station.

592
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,832
I worry when a beautiful lady
takes the subway alone

593
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,660
at night.

594
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,500
It would be more worrying
if you sent me home.

595
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,060
That sounds kind of accusing.

596
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,323
What styles of lingerie
do you have in your store?

597
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,894
Why are you asking?

598
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,820
Don't get me wrong.

599
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,420
I'm asking for my friend.

600
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,020
I thought you were going to buy some.

601
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,220
Why would I buy them?

602
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,900
Can you introduce some styles for me?

603
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,520
We have plenty of styles in our store.

604
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,780
There are ones in pure silk

605
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,420
and lace.

606
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,700
Anything you want.

607
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,980
Do you sell cute ones?

608
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,460
Cute ones?

609
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,660
Let me check.

610
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,100
Yes, we do.

611
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,076
How about this?
I'll make you a grab bag.

612
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,940
Sure.

613
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,340
My apologies.

614
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,060
It's fine.

615
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,540
All set.

616
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,020
Feel free to buy it.
We deliver what's promised.

617
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,305
What's going on?

618
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,580
Poor driving etiquette
brings tears to loved ones.

619
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,780
(Don't make wild guesses.)

620
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,060
Once I drop you off,

621
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,860
I need to pick up someone else.

622
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
It's so exhausting.

623
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,980
Who would that be?

624
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,340
The most troublesome
person in the world.

625
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,100
Is it a he or a she?

626
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,500
A she.

627
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,340
Don't get me wrong.

628
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,796
She grew up with me and Qingche,

629
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,345
we treat her as your younger sister.

630
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:53,425
I didn't get anything wrong,
so don't overthink it.

631
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,580
See?

632
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,740
You're overthinking it.

633
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,660
Don't think too much about it.

634
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,389
She's truly like a little sister to us.

635
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,272
I'm tired. Just focus on driving, okay?

636
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,380
So, where is your home?

637
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,500
You haven't told me yet.

638
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,860
Just keep going straight.

639
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,300
(Lu Qun, you're so stupid.)

640
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,940
Won't you get tired of looking?

641
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,727
I just want to spend more time with you.

642
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,723
When did you learn to sweet talk?

643
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,927
This is so unusual.
Are you running a fever?

644
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,020
You do have a fever.

645
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,940
No way.

646
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,020
It's real.

647
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,140
Come with me.

648
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,360
I have fever medicine at home.

649
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,340
I'm fine, really.

650
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,620
I can drive myself home

651
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,560
even with a 40-degree fever.

652
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:04,700
Do you have fever pills?
even with a 40-degree fever.

653
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,540
Do you have fever pills?

654
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,100
No.

655
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:06,940
Get off then.

656
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,260
Come in.

657
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,940
Wear this.

658
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,560
I don't have shoes for men.

659
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,620
Just wear it.

660
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,300
Feel free to sit.

661
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,580
Change into this,

662
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,819
or the wound might get infected.

663
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,060
Also, take your temperature

664
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,200
while I get the medicine.

665
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,940
Thank you.

666
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,500
Take four of these at once.

667
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,940
Do you have any other discomforts?

668
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,300
(38.4°)

669
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,660
Already asleep?

670
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,340
Ever since we met,

671
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,020
not many good things
have happened to us.

672
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,740
In the woods,

673
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,620
the village...

674
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,780
You're so handsome.

675
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,380
Pretending to sleep

676
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,380
is an unforgivable crime.

677
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,140
Are you done pretending?

678
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,940
Chat with me.

679
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,260
Sure,

680
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,500
but take your medicine.

681
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,100
Seeing as you have a fever,

682
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,060
I'll keep you company for a while.

683
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,340
Don't you want to chat?

684
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,380
If not, I'll leave.

685
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,740
I have a friend.

686
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,060
He's pursuing a girl.

687
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,660
They're usually great together,

688
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,300
happy

689
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,060
and in sync.

690
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,340
But sometimes,

691
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,380
they suddenly become distant.

692
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,180
So, he desperately wants to know

693
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,620
what that girl is thinking.

694
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,260
So, you want to know

695
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,780
what women care about the most, right?

696
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,420
A mature woman

697
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,540
dislikes continuous ambiguity the most.

698
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,380
What a woman wants

699
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,820
is to be unequivocally possessed.

700
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,980
So,

701
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,740
now you can possess me.

702
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,780
