(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,760
=Episode 5=

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,060
Because you drank on my behalf,

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,020
I'll send you back.

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,940
Let's go.

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,740
Song Xingchen.

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,940
What?

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,300
I...

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,580
Su Qingche, that was intentional.

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,260
Sorry.

32
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,020
What are you doing early in the morning?

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,320
We...

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,660
What about us?

35
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,660
Did we do something last night?

36
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,270
If we actually did something,

37
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,700
what would you do?

38
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,780
So we did...

39
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,600
I didn't expect you
to behave so badly after drinking.

40
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,110
I wanted you to sleep on the sofa,

41
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,220
but you fell asleep
on the bed and I couldn't...

42
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,140
Stop.

43
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,420
I'll be responsible.

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,580
- How are you going to be responsible?
- By marrying you.

45
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,210
Is that necessary?

46
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,280
Why are you so old fashion?

47
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm serious.

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,480
Let me explain to you.

49
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,900
Yesterday,

50
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,740
nothing happened.

51
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,970
Nothing happened?

52
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,700
Why are you explaining so much then?

53
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,580
It's just my occupational disease.

54
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,580
No. But we're lying in the same bed.

55
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,780
Why are we

56
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,820
lying in the same bed?

57
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,420
I only have one bed.

58
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,250
Where else would
you sleep if not in the bed?

59
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,540
I only remember dragging you out.

60
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,900
I don't remember anything else.

61
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,910
You don't remember?

62
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,420
Take your time thinking about it.

63
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,380
Good one.

64
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,900
How long are you
planing to lie in my bed for?

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,260
I don't know if your clothes are dry.

66
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,860
You should wash your trousers.

67
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,310
There are bathrobes in the bathroom.

68
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,100
Does my bathrobe fit you?

69
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,140
What do you think?

70
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,660
I think it's quite good.

71
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,020
Did you sleep well?

72
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,380
What do you think?

73
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,260
I had to do laundry at midnight.

74
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,580
I don't want sweet porridge.

75
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,780
No glycation.

76
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,060
Why are you so happy?

77
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,850
A play that I like very much

78
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,340
is doing a tour.

79
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,880
(Haicheng. People who
are Lost in Memory Sold out)

80
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,140
Buy tickets.

81
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,380
The tickets are hard to get.

82
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,050
And I have to grab
the tickets at a certain time.

83
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,740
Tickets for today are sold out.

84
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,570
What?

85
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,820
Sorry. My business wasn't good.

86
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,180
It's some overstock.

87
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,900
Ms. Song.

88
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,780
This is how

89
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,100
you treat your products?
By placing them at random places.

90
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,100
It offended Captain Su.

92
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,220
It's okay.

93
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,260
I know that wasn't intentional.

94
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,660
Where did you find rice in my house?

95
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,340
And this century egg.

96
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,110
Where did you find
century eggs in my house?

97
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,110
You haven't been into
your kitchen for a long time, right?

98
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,020
The kitchen should
thank me for not exploding it.

99
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
About

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,580
yesterday,

101
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,620
no matter what...

102
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,380
Stop.

103
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,260
Although you behaved awfully last night,

104
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,180
given your performance today,

105
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,180
I shall forgive you for now.

106
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,900
But please tell me

107
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,300
what I did.

108
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,340
You really can't recall?

109
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,020
Okay.

110
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Let me help you find your memory.

111
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,860
Last night, you got drunk.

112
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,540
For unknown reasons,

113
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,860
you pulled me up

114
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,780
and dragged me from the box
to the corridor of the nightclub.

115
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,220
Then you did kabedon to me.

116
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,340
Kabedon?

117
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,700
Sorry.

118
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,620
So it's true that nothing happened?

119
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,740
Or else?

120
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,300
What did you expect to happen?

121
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,980
Since I've troubled you

122
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,660
so much last night,

123
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,540
this breakfast shall be

124
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
my apology to you.

125
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,100
That's how you want to make it up?

126
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,940
What do you want?

127
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,260
Dry cleaning fee.

128
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,500
And the accommodation fee

129
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,820
for staying a night here.

130
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,410
It'll be converted to a big gift package
for festival in my shop.

131
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
It's sent to your phone.

132
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,380
Buying goods to pay off your debts
is my greatest kindness to you.

133
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
Why don't you think about
why I got drunk?

134
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,220
Isn't it to protect you?

135
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,100
How did you know
that I couldn't handle it?

136
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,500
I didn't want others
to take advantage of you.

137
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,980
I don't need your protection.

138
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,180
Tidy up and go back.

139
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,300
I have to go to my shop.

140
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,300
What now?

141
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,940
You've to get me some clothes

142
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,300
that I can go out with.

143
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,260
Are you kidding?

144
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,420
This?

145
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,820
Don't you like pink?

146
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,340
This was also in the bathroom,

147
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,850
yet you still chose the pink one.

148
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,980
Was it?

149
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,300
Yes.

150
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,700
There's no way I'm wearing this.

151
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,060
(Polar Night Rescue)
That's it.

152
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,780
Qingche, nice one.

153
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,740
Growing rich silently, aren't you?

154
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,740
Like I said,

155
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,530
it was an accident.

156
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,300
I don't believe that you did nothing.

157
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,940
I really did nothing.

158
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,670
I understand.

159
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,420
You've been single for years after all.

160
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,980
It's normal that you can't control.

161
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't talk
if you don't know what to say.

162
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,000
What important is,

163
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,540
when I text and call her,

164
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,500
she doesn't respond.

165
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,140
That's simple. Block her.

166
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,660
Block her? Are you a hooligan?

167
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,120
Besides, I'm not so petty.

168
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,500
Your fate

169
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,800
has been decided.

170
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,900
In fact, I can tell that.

171
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,740
Since you like her,

172
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,100
pursue her.

173
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:30,820
No.

174
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,380
A noble army wins by strategies.

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,720
Can I not pursue her?

176
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,900
Can I attract her
to make her take initiative?

177
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,840
The key is
I don't know how to pursue her.

178
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,180
The current situation is that both
your military strengths have wide gaps.

179
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,540
You're so in love with her,

180
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,380
yet she's not showing affection.

181
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,180
This is no time for plotting,

182
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,900
but for ice-breaking.

183
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Tell me how to break it.

184
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Same thing. Be a fan of her carrier.

185
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,380
I'm following the channel.

186
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:00,940
Look.

187
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,380
Of our team?

188
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,900
No. Of Song Xingchen.

189
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,260
She wants to use
her channel to attract more traffic.

190
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm studying it.

191
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,460
This is a good opportunity.

192
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,260
You can take care of her business

193
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,840
while getting to know
about her daily life.

194
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,260
Penetrate right into her heart.

195
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,440
So pretty.

196
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,730
But her traffic is bad. Poor business.

197
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,220
Let's support her.

198
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,460
Okay. Support her.

199
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,620
This is quite good.

200
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,980
You should buy 10.

201
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,540
Bro.

202
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,690
I haven't finished using
what you made me buy last time.

203
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
I know, 10.

204
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,500
Don't choose one by one.

205
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,780
Why don't we just buy her shop?

206
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,500
That's not a bad idea.

207
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,100
This is quite good as well.

208
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,540
- Okay.
- Same rules, 10 pieces.

209
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,740
Dear, you must trust me.

210
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,300
This pajamas feels very...

211
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,020
This pajamas...

212
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,180
Very comfortable.

213
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,660
Forget it. Let's try again later.

214
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,460
Dear, keep up the good work.

215
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,460
We have an order.

216
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
This is so tough.

217
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,400
One clip has to be
recorded so many times.

218
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,060
My tongue is tangling.

219
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,260
Besides, I found out,

220
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,250
no one is watching
this live stream review at all.

221
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,300
If this goes on,

222
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,470
we'll fail on Women's Day.

223
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,940
Don't give up.

224
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,820
Our phased goal this time is

225
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,380
to clear inventory
during this online event.

226
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,830
And we didn't order a lot.

227
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,380
So don't be stressed.

228
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,250
Tell me,

229
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,500
how to increase the audience

230
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,020
of a video with five viewers

231
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,700
in a short time?

232
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,660
I have an idea.

233
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,420
Have a look at this.

234
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,380
This.

235
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,860
What?

236
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,620
I found a blogger.

237
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,820
(Did you smell this)

238
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,860
(through the screen?)

239
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,260
(This perfume)

240
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,500
(can be gifted to your boyfriend
and girlfriend.)

241
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,220
Look.

242
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,820
This blogger has her style

243
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,980
in introducing products.

244
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,660
(Especially your boyfriend.)

245
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,220
(It can deepen
your relationship with him.)

246
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,220
It's too sweet. I can't do it.

247
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,900
I don't believe

248
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,740
that you haven't flirted
with Qingche before.

249
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Don't mention him.

250
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,140
Every time you mention him,

251
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,140
I'm speechless.

252
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,740
What's up?

253
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,780
Su Qingche

254
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,110
was drunk and
stayed over at my place last night.

255
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,260
What?

256
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,500
Did you two...

257
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,980
No. How is that possible?

258
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,220
You threw up on me and him.

259
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,410
I washed his clothes at midnight.

260
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
That's all.

261
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,580
Let's think about
how to increase traffic.

262
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,820
You're out of the topic.

263
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,740
Nowadays celebrities

264
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,580
are taking ads like this.

265
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,700
What should small potatoes like us do?

266
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,380
I've been studying this

267
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,060
in the past few days.

268
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,940
Not every celebrity has
high back-end conversion rate.

269
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,220
It would be great
to have something more exciting.

270
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,380
Do you want to be blocked?

271
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,780
No.

272
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,630
(The emergence of new media)

273
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,080
(New media economy)

274
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,820
For this subject,
other than the article scores

275
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,660
and the grading
for practical assignments,

276
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,270
I've given you much time

277
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,700
to understand
and take part in live streams.

278
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,700
In the end of the semester...

279
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,420
Why have I lost some?

280
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,660
The result of the practical assignments

281
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,820
must be uploaded.

282
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,420
Hey, how many fans do you have?

283
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,500
Those who didn't do it properly...

284
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,180
About 3,000.

285
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,740
So many?

286
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,540
It wasn't good in the beginning.

287
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,140
It's getting better now.

288
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,540
What is new media economy?

289
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,180
Thank you.

290
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,020
The penetration
of new economy development

291
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,870
(Kiki, I need urgent help.)
in all walks of life

292
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,210
(Let me show up in your channel)
has led to the new media economy.

293
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,220
(I have a contract now. I can't.)
The emergence of this new economic

294
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,900
development based mainly
on the openness and interactivity

295
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,420
of the new media environment.

296
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,500
It also increases
the interactivity of information.

297
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,260
I have an idea.

298
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,180
At the same time,

299
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,940
new media economy

300
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,700
largely...

301
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,300
When is it starting?

302
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,420
Why are you here?

303
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,900
Your traffic is too low.

304
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,740
Why don't we try to be partners?

305
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,000
Perhaps the result will be good.

306
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,940
Would it work?

307
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,910
I only have a few fans.

308
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,060
I don't want to see our Ms. Song

309
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,140
being starved to death.

310
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,820
You have no idea

311
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,380
how many fans I gained recently.

312
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,740
Alright, you sweet-talker.

313
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,140
You're well-equipped.

314
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
I'm just taking them back to do homework.

315
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,710
I can take some photos of your products.

316
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,110
I'll make you
a partnered live stream for free.

317
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,390
I'll show you

318
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,940
what a sales-miracle is.

319
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,540
Okay, I shall believe you once.

320
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,230
(Stardust Rouge that
you follow has a new video.)

321
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,500
(Hello, dear.)

322
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,890
(I'm here to give you benefits again.)

323
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,260
(Hello, everyone.)

324
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,380
(I'm your cute and handsome Qian Cheng.)

325
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,060
(Today Xingchen and I)

326
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,660
(will be promoting some items to you.)

327
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,100
(Are you surprised?)

328
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,580
Why is he here?

329
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,980
(What?)

330
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,570
(The factory director
doesn't allow a price reduction?)

331
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,060
(No way!)

332
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,580
(No way at all!)

333
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,140
(Stardust Rouge is here
to bring you the best benefits)

334
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,820
(at the lowest price.)

335
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,020
(We'll never disappoint our customers.)

336
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,420
(Then we'll lose money.)

337
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,570
(Why should we keep selling?)

338
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,420
(No way.)

339
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,060
(Customers are our god.)

340
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,980
(We have to give them the best benefits.)

341
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,130
(Qingche, are you
watching Xingchen's live stream?)

342
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,620
Yes.

343
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,860
(Yes. It's very airy, right?)

344
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,180
(Yes. The main thing is the pattern.)

345
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,020
(Isn't this lace sexy?)

346
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,780
Don't mind it.

347
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,110
That's understandable for business.

348
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
(I'm love in with it.)

349
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,620
I'll stop.

350
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,060
(- Are you tempted?
- I'm definitely tempted.)

351
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,340
(This is an authentic silk pajamas)

352
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,220
(that all couples should have.)

353
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,180
(And the discount
is only available today.)

354
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,660
(Right.)

355
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,460
(Other than seeing a brand new you,)

356
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,100
(it can also brush away your fatigue.)

357
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,940
(Dear, grab the chance to order now.)

358
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,940
(Discount only available today.)

359
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,900
(Today's discount
will surely make you happy.)

360
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,460
(Come on.)

361
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,900
(Hurry up!)

362
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,420
(Mr. Su?)

363
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,660
Relationship?

364
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,260
We're old friends.

365
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,880
Why are you standing so close?

366
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,970
Why are they flirting with each other?

367
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,310
(It's useless to nag to me.)

368
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,100
(I think you should
take action quickly.)

369
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,700
Do you think I'll lose?

370
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,340
Qingche, don't be reckless.

371
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,620
Don't do anything.

372
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,020
I was wondering
why did you have time to help me today.

373
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,910
So you're trying
to increase traffic for your channel.

374
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,140
I have no choice.

375
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,510
I've to submit my homework soon.

376
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,420
But I have so few fans.

377
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,110
Otherwise, I'll have to retake
the course.

378
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,340
But I must remind you,

379
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,660
the decoration in your shop is bad.

380
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,860
How bad?

381
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
You need some high-quality photos.

382
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,820
Let me give you an example.

383
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,900
Look.

384
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,980
By making your products more high-end,

385
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,180
your sales will increase.

386
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Are you busy today?

387
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,060
No.

388
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,530
Since you're not busy,

389
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,460
help me take some photos.

390
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,860
Sure.

391
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,260
But we need a model.

392
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,220
Where do I find a model?

393
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,060
You.

394
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,260
Me?

395
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,700
Song Xingchen.

396
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,660
Why are you here?

397
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,420
Song Xingchen.

398
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,540
No. Do you have to wear this?

399
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,220
Can't you cover up

400
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,460
with something?

401
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,540
Don't our products look good?

402
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,140
Yes, but...

403
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,340
Okay. If you have
nothing else, move aside.

404
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,260
I...

405
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,420
Qian Cheng, let's start.

406
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,540
Step back a little.

407
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
Okay. Smile.

408
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,340
Yes.

409
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,580
More sexy.

410
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,500
No sexy.

411
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,740
Close this.

412
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,900
Don't open.

413
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,740
Go away.

414
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,660
Just like this.

415
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,900
Yes.

416
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,820
Raise your hand more.

417
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,220
This is good. Yes.

418
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,500
- Not both hand.
- Xingchen.

419
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,260
Don't raise both hands.

420
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,820
Why don't I put this cloth on you?

421
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,980
Put your left hand down.

422
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,650
Put your left hand down.
Yes, right hand.

423
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,710
Don't raise your right hand upwards
like the Statue of Liberty.

424
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,060
Touch...

425
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,100
Su Qingche, please go away.

426
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,960
I'm working.

427
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,860
Go away.

428
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,540
Or else I'll chase you out.

429
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,100
Come on.

430
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,540
Yes.

431
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,660
Show your left face.

432
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,100
Yes. Left face.
No, don't touch your face.

433
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,340
You're still cute.

434
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,180
We need sexiness.

435
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,540
What do you want?

436
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,300
No, Song Xingchen.

437
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,700
Your movement is too stiff.

438
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,500
Then stop the shooting.

439
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,620
What about this?

440
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,980
I'll find you a partner
and you can try to feel it.

441
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,340
Since we have a male pajamas.

442
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,780
I'll call a male model.

443
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,740
You can search your feelings.

444
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Search what?

445
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,860
Search what?

446
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,420
I'll do it.

447
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,020
You?

448
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Can I not?

449
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,220
Exactly what I need.

450
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,220
Mr. Su, don't be nervous. Relax, okay?

451
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,980
Unbutton your shirt.

452
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,180
Unbutton.

453
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,300
One more.

454
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,460
Face each other.

455
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,420
Song Xingchen.

456
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,100
Put your hand on his chest.

457
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,620
Mr. Su.

458
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,740
Put your hands
around Song Xingchen's waist.

459
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,370
Closer.

460
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,320
Closer.

461
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,860
Song Xingchen.

462
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,180
I love you.

463
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,300
Since the first time we met,

464
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,100
I've fallen for you.

465
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,670
♪If tomorrow is also a sunny day♪

466
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,580
♪Shall we make a date now?♪

467
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,790
♪Don't make me miss you too much♪

468
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,000
♪If tomorrow is rainy♪

469
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:38,050
♪Hurry up and use your hands as eaves♪

470
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,310
♪Get closer so I can hear♪

471
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,130
I'm here in the parking lot.

472
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,240
Let me know if there's anything.

473
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,660
(How are you? Can you do it alone?)

474
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,220
No problem. Small matter. I can do it.

475
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,020
(If there're
too many goods, wait for me.)

476
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,420
(When I'm done,)

477
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,340
(I'll carry them with you.)

478
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,700
No. If I need you for everything,

479
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,740
I would be useless.

480
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,660
Dear, I'm hanging up.

481
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,210
The porter I hired is here.

482
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,340
Go ahead with your work.

483
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,280
I'll come to you soon.

484
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,460
Why are you here?

485
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,620
I heard that

486
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,780
Qingche is helping Ms. Song in a video.

487
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,020
And the photographer is that little boy.

488
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,980
That's why I came.

489
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm afraid Qingche might lose out.

490
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,380
The two of you...

491
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,260
Where's your porter?

492
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Is he transparent?

493
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,500
I won't waste money
on such a small matter.

494
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,380
Thank you.

495
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,100
No big deal.

496
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,650
Helping a pretty woman to work
is the basic quality of a macho man.

497
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,460
Macho man?

498
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,340
No macho man is as busybody as you.

499
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,940
Is that little boy

500
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,900
Ms. Song's boyfriend?

501
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,900
You're indeed here for information.

502
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,780
Gossips should be shared.

503
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,540
Excuse me.

504
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,260
I'm having this gossip alone.

505
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,620
Have your Captain Su

506
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,900
ask Xingchen himself.

507
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,700
Alright then.

508
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,460
Thank you.

509
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,500
Let me help you.

510
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,140
No need.

511
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,120
I can do it myself.

512
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,780
Go ahead with your work.

513
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,260
Okay.

514
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,140
Hello, Qingche. Where are you?

515
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,580
Okay. Wait for me
by the road for a minute.

516
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,720
(Women's Day. Stardust Rogue)

517
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,300
Here.

518
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,380
My order is here.

519
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,660
This is your order. Be careful.

520
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,140
Thank you.

521
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,300
Please leave us good reviews.

522
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:19,820
Okay.

523
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,820
Bye.

524
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,830
Thanks to this video,

525
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,100
the momentum of
the live stream is in place.

526
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,100
We'll wait for your fatal blow tonight.

527
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
Victory is achieved.

528
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,340
Okay. How's the delivery?

529
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,020
It's not a false marketing

530
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,890
that I promised
to accomplish my mission, okay?

531
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,660
(Is there any model that can display)

532
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,760
(the male pajamas?)

533
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,230
(There are many pretty women.
But handsome men are rare.)

534
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,940
(Is there a male version?
Can you show a sample?)

535
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,660
(It looks good.
Is the male model still there?)

536
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,900
(Host, will the young man
partnered with you come again?)

537
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,100
(I would buy more.)

538
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,340
Male model.

539
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,060
Xingchen, are you still busy?

540
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,340
I brought you milk tea.

541
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,500
You're here just in time.

542
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,220
Do me a favor.

543
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:26,980
What favor?

544
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,500
Your body is so fit.

545
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,740
Lend it to me.

546
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,700
How?

547
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,070
(Women's day)

548
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,780
(Women's Day)
Why am I

549
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,780
wearing like a boss?

550
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,580
Hello, today is Women's Day.

551
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,660
Welcome to

552
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,610
the live stream of Stardust Rouge.

553
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,820
Most importantly,

554
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
I would like to introduce

555
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,820
our male model.

556
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,300
Leave more comments.

557
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,100
(This male model is just
as handsome in the live stream.)

558
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,820
(There's too much handsomeness today.)

559
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,700
What should I say?

560
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,020
Hold on.

561
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,740
(Any free gift? What size is the
host wearing? Looks good. I ordered.)

562
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,110
(This set of couple)

563
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,820
This set of couple pajamas
has a summer and a winter version.

564
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,780
The summer version is
of silk quality and it's soft.

565
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,650
The winter version is made
of pure cotton. It's light and warm.

566
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,710
Don't keep staring at the cue card

567
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,770
or you'll be busted.

568
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,580
Did you forget?

569
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,700
Anyway, yes,

570
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,940
this pajamas

571
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,280
is very comfortable.

572
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,260
If you're buying it for your boyfriend,

573
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,580
it's definitely a good choice.

574
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,580
I'm back again.

575
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,220
Is the male model handsome?

576
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,130
He has introduced well, right?

577
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,060
Next,

578
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,180
I want to introduce to you

579
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,300
these pajamas behind me.

580
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,340
This red suit...

581
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,660
Here.

582
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,540
The tickets you wanted.

583
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,000
(People who are Lost in Memory)

584
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,980
I've put in so much effort.

585
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,290
Luckily I thought about the massage gun.

586
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,850
Or else this finger of mine

587
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,140
will be damaged from clicking.

588
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,380
What did you say?

589
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,460
Thank you.

590
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,940
Hurry to ask her out.

591
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,140
(People who are Lost in Memory)

592
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,940
I didn't expect them
to be such a good match.

593
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,020
What are you watching?

594
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,020
Look.

595
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,940
Someone recorded their live stream

596
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,980
the other day.

597
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,980
Isn't she that person?

598
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,780
Yes. So sweet.

599
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,260
Such a good match.

600
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,180
What are you watching?

601
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,380
Look at this.

602
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,920
Look.

603
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,780
Look at how ignorant you two are.

604
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,860
Weiling.

605
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,140
Aren't you interested in
a drama plot between

606
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,640
a handsome man and a pretty woman?

607
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,620
I'm only interested in this.

608
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,340
You're interested in this?

609
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,580
That means you
don't have high demand for look.

610
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,660
I think I have a chance.

611
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,780
Do you know how to dive?

612
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,860
Yes.

613
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,500
But I need more practice.

614
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,700
The snorkeling training is soon.

615
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,980
Hurry to get ready.

616
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,860
Yes.

617
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,540
Weiling.

618
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,420
Why did Captain Su

619
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,940
arrange the snorkeling training?

620
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,620
It's a waste of time and energy.

621
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,580
Because it's hard
to rescue someone underwater.

622
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,740
Polar Night has
limited experience in this aspect.

623
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,060
Even a seasoned teammate like Lin Mu

624
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,760
who has plenty of rescue experience

625
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
turns into a landlubber in water.

626
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,730
If we face danger,

627
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,900
we might become the one being rescued.

628
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,500
Captain Su

629
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,290
does think ahead.

630
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,780
Why did he

631
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,100
become like this when he met Xingchen?

632
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,380
Actually I like this couple too.

633
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,660
Get on with the training.

634
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,340
Are the photos I took so powerful?

635
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,100
You sold so much

636
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,380
after they went online for a day.

637
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,220
Did you see it?

638
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,380
This is professional.

639
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
The sales went up

640
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,130
because of Su Qingche.

641
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,060
Su Qingche?

642
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,140
He came for live stream yesterday?

643
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,900
Yes. It was a hit.

644
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,060
Compared to your tiny traffic,

645
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,220
yours was nothing.

646
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,180
He must have been selling his charm.

647
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,940
Captain Su

648
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,580
has born talent.

649
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,980
He doesn't use tricks like yours.

650
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,940
I think you should learn from him.

651
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,720
Would you die if you compliment me?

652
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,660
Yes.

653
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,180
No.

654
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,620
Qian the Famous, can you help?

655
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,580
Sport is good for health.

656
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,020
I stayed up all night
to write my article.

657
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
Besides,

658
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,070
as the best friend of my aunt,

659
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,180
shouldn't you care about
the health of this young man?

660
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,700
You?

661
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,580
- Writing an article?
- Yes.

662
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,460
I bet you stayed up to play games.

663
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,980
Where's Song Xingchen?

664
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,660
She's went to thank

665
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,780
the real famous person.

666
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,660
Why are you here?

667
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,270
I'm here to thank you.

668
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,380
What's this?

669
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,620
A small gift.

670
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,660
Yesterday's best-selling male pajamas.

671
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,660
You looked good in it.

672
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,220
Thank you.

673
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,140
Any drinks?

674

675
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,500

Did I help you more

679
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,620
or Qian Cheng?

680
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,230
Do all men like to compare

681
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,680
ridiculous things?

682
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,890
I'm not comparing. I...

683
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,540
I care about your thought.

684
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,140
My thought isn't important.

685
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,100
The customers' thoughts are important.

686
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,180
That's right.

687
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,580
From now on, you can contact me

Other people?

692
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,460
You mean Qian Cheng?

693
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
We'll have a fair battle.

694
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,020
I can do everything he can.

695
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,330
Besides, I can do it better than him.

696
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,340
You're battling to be

697
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,580
my live stream partner?

698
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,780
I'm more suitable than him.

699
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,580
The two of you
didn't start at the same point.

700
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,420
Even if we didn't
start at the same point,

701

leave in half an hour.

do you have, Captain Su?

It's quite good.

I wonder if you have time.

716
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,540
Should I have time?

717
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,820
The tickets are hard to get.

718

I fought a week for them.

719
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,670
Okay.

720
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,340
I'll give it a thought.

Bye.

Ms. Han, I'm taking half a day off.

I have a date.
