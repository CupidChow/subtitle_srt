=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 11=

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,140
Make way.

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,980
Kid.

26
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,340
That won't work.

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,883
Are you the parent?

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,300
Kid.

29
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,100
Where's the parent?

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,680
They must have gone to the supermarket

31
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:55,020
while the kid stayed in the car.

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,900
He spoke before.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,700
Now, he's silent.

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,180
Yeah.

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,620
Can you hear me?

36
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,643
Have you called the emergency hotlines?

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,429
Not yet. I'll do it.

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,260
Yes, do it.

39
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,900
Kid.

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,180
Break the glass.

41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,780
OK.

42
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,647
This is bad for him.

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,380
OK.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,900
Everyone, move back.

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,820
Move back.

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,340
Three. Two.

47
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,140
One.

48
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,340
Anyone has water?

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,060
Yes. Here.

50
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,500
Come.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,540
Come.

52
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,620
Have some water, kid.

53
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,940
Remember the number plate.

54
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,100
Use the supermarket PA system

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,065
to call for the parent.

56
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,420
Wipe his face.

57
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,860
Get him more water.

58
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,940
You're fine now, kid.

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,700
Don't be scared.

60
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,420
We've saved you.

61
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,220
You're fine.

62
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,460
Your parents will be back soon.

63
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,340
My baby.

64
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,180
Make way.

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,900
What happened?

66
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,460
Baby.

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,980
His mom?

68
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,500
Yes.

69
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,780
Come. I'm here.

70
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,180
Let me hold you.

71
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,660
You can't do this.

72
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,280
It's very hot,

73
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,780
yet you left him in the car alone.

74
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,700
Some died from that.

75
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Luckily they were here.

76
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,300
Otherwise, he'd be dead.

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,380
Thank you very much.

78
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,569
Your hand okay?

79
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,650
It seemed that you were cut.

80
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:24,123
Hi.

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,140
Hi, please wait.

82
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,100
I'd like to add you on WeChat.

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,490
Let me thank you with a Red Packet.

84
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:30,700
There's no need.

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,180
We're a social welfare group.

86
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,540
Yes.

87
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,658
Just give us a follow.

88
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:34,500
Polar Night Rescue.

89
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,949
Call us when you need help.

90
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,300
Okay. I'll do that.

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,300
Don't they look like superheroes?

92
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,100
Say thank you.

93
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,180
Can I take a photo with you?

94
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,860
Sure.

95
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,540
Sure.

96
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,780
Come.

97
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,580
Come.

98
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,120
(Supermarket)
You're much better now, right?

99
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,100
Tell your mom to buy you ice cream.

100
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,380
She did something wrong today.

101
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,660
Look over here.

102
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,940
One. Two. Three.

103
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,100
Miss.

104
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,900
Call me when you need help again.

105
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,060
Thank you, miss.

106
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,220
Go home.

107
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,220
Bye, Huahua.

108
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,700
Bye, miss.

109
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,060
Hey, Mom.

110
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,580
You still remember your mom?

111
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,420
(Just look at you.)

112
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,349
(How long has it been
since you were last home?)

113
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,700
Just what's keeping you busy out there?

114
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,340
Chen.

115
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,060
Don't listen to your mom.

116
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,780
(Just come home.)

117
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,180
(I'll cook you a feast.)

118
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,380
Come home soon.

119
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,700
Flatterer. A daughter's devotee.

120
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,660
I'm a devotee of my wife.

121
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,220
Mom.

122
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,180
You're home, Xingchen.

123
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,980
Tang is back too.

124
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
He's here to visit us.

125
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,100
I'll leave you two to talk.

126
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,580
Why didn't you tell me

127
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,643
you're visiting my parents?

128
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,763
I was afraid you were busy,

129
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,140
so I came alone.

130
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,540
No ambushes in the future.

131
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,420
Okay.

132
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,300
Dad, I'm home.

133
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,060
Good.

134
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,980
Don't touch.

135
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,500
You'll ruin it.

136
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,860
Dad.

137
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,260
Be honest with me.

138
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,220
If it and I fall into the water

139
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,220
at the same time,

140
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,260
who will you save?

141
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,740
That's a familiar question.

142
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,700
Is that even a question?

143
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,540
My daughter

144
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,700
is my life.

145
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,700
However,

146
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
this sculpture is my heart.

147
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,740
You sly fox.

148
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,620
Here. Have some apple.

149
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,090
Thanks. I can serve myself.

150
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,460
Tang.

151
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,900
It's almost time to eat.

152
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,380
Stay and dine with us?

153
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,340
Okay.

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,170
It has been ages
since I tasted your food.

155
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,540
Okay. Xingcheng,
set another place at the table.

156
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,540
The moment you're here,

157
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,660
it's like I was adopted.

158
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,660
Have more, Tang.

159
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,620
I was rushing today.

160
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,620
Pardon the taste.

161
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,540
This is really good in my eyes.

162
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,940
I usually eat takeaway.

163
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,780
Thanks, Madam Hu.

164
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,580
Takeaway is bad for your health.

165
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,980
You should come over
whenever you're free.

166
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,500
Okay.

167
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,860
Oh, I left the fish on the stove.

168
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,700
I'll go get it.

169
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,700
What? Am I going as well?

170
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,300
I can't carry it on my own. Let's go.

171
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,740
Get up.

172
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,580
Are you okay?

173
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,340
Cut out the foolish matchmaking, okay?

174
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,300
How is it foolish?

175
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,100
Tang is your favored student.

176
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,540
When he was in university,

177
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,100
he was in your sculpture class.

178
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,460
Back then,

179
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,380
he also dated your daughter.

180
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,140
Tang is not a bad man,

181
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,580
but he did fight with her.

182
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,820
They broke up.

183
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,100
That's a fact.

184
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,420
I can't get over that.

185
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,060
Why can't you?

186
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,500
You just favor your daughter too much.

187
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,380
They broke up for their careers.

188
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,620
It was a peaceful breakup.

189
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,020
It was not like the others

190
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,060
who broke up
because they couldn't get along.

191
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,940
Look.

192
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,980
Look at Tang.

193
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,900
Clearly,

194
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,140
he still cares for Xingchen.

195
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,020
Tang is a successful man.

196
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:10,167
He has a house and a car.

197
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,300
We know him well.

198
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,500
He's much better than the other men.

199
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
No matter what,

200
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,460
we should first respect her wishes.

201
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,980
Right?

202
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,940
Stop meddling, okay?

203
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,580
How is this meddling?

204
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,780
I'm giving them a push.

205
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,620
Here.

206
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,170
Thank you, Madam Hu.

207
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,140
You're welcome.

208
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,460
Let me see.

209
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,260
Well?

210
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,694
Your cooking is as good as ever.

211
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,465
It's delicious.

212
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,900
Tang.

213
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,020
After the breakup with Xingchen,

214
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,420
have you dated anyone else?

215
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,180
Mom.

216
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,540
No. I was busy with work.

217
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,340
Really?

218
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,180
Xingchen has been single as well.

219
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,900
Mom.

220
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,820
Hear me out.

221
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,900
All you kids know is your work.

222
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,032
You should experience love.

223
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,500
What's with you?

224
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,540
If your throat hurts,
take some medication.

225
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:12,220
Stop coughing.

226
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,700
Mom, can you stop talking?

227
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm done. I'm on a diet.

228
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,500
No.

229
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,460
Ignore her, Tang.

230
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,420
Have more food.

231
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,549
How are you going back?

232
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,589
Do you need a ride?

233
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:33,660
It's fine. I drove here.

234
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,620
About the shop,

235
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,420
take your time. It's no rush.

236
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,940
Um...

237
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,820
You know how my mom is.

238
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,780
She's always so anxious.

239
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,820
What she said just now,

240
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,980
please don't take it to heart.

241
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,700
It's fine.
She has your best interests in mind.

242
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,940
It's understandable.

243
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,709
I want to live to 100.

244
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,780
This is only a third of it.

245
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,660
This is nonsense.

246
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,220
Sometimes, you think you were right,

247
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,660
but after time passed by,

248
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,580
you'll soon realize

249
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:05,340
that you might be wrong.

250
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,300
Still, what I chose was

251
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,020
the best possible choice

252
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,900
after deliberation.

253
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,700
You have a quick wit.

254
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,180
Oh, right.

255
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,676
The distribution rights
for that Japanese brand.

256
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,460
How are the talks?

257
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,460
We're doing our best.

258
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:20,660
We just familiarized ourselves

259
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,300
with their product information.

260
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:24,014
We're going to contact them soon

261
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,460
to suss out the situation.

262
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,300
Okay.

263
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,060
Let me know if you need anything.

264
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,780
Okay. I'll be going now.

265
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,820
Amazing.

266
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,900
The more I look at Tang,

267
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,020
the more satisfied I am.

268
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,820
We're helping our daughter find a match.

269
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,460
What use is your satisfaction?

270
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,580
What do you know?

271
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,100
Xingchen is a busy woman.

272
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,780
In this month,

273
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,900
how many times has she visited us?

274
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,860
When it comes to a boyfriend,

275
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,780
we'll have to handle that for her.

276
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,700
Jianguo, hear me out.

277
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,460
When it comes to Xingchen's boyfriend,

278
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,660
you must stand united with me.

279
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,100
You're the leader of the family.
I follow you.

280
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,520
(Stardust Rogue)

281
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,880
(Han Xiaoli)

282
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,820
Hello?

283
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,654
How are you feeling?
Has the cold improved?

284
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

285
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,283
By the way, I've reviewed

286
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:51,854
Captain Su's translation materials.

287
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:54,327
The proposal meeting with the agency
is scheduled for tomorrow.

288
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,770
I've been preparing for the proposal
these past few days.

289
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,700
It's just
that we don't have much advantage

290
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,660
in sales channels.

291
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,380
Should we still go?

292
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,580
(Of course.)

293
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,460
Just see how I handle the debate

294
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,330
and secure the agency tomorrow.

295
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,260
(Alright.)

296
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,260
Okay, take care and get some more rest.

297
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,512
(Child accidentally trapped,
nearly turned into a tragic incident)

298
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,380
This article is quite good.

299
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,340
Great content.

300
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,980
It was published very timely.

301
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,500
I think

302
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,220
articles like this,
that can remind everyone

303
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,420
of safety awareness,

304
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,912
should be prepared and published more.

305
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,100
Right?

306
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,100
Prevention is better than rescue.

307
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,780
That's the meaning
of our rescue team's existence.

308
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
This is rare. You're speaking seriously.

309
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,060
I'm always serious
when I'm working, okay?

310
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,220
By the way, what...

311
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,374
What have those two girls
been busy with recently?

312
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,140
Xingchen should be busy

313
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,660
with the brand's transformation.

314
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,500
It seems like they're negotiating
for the agency rights

315
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,580
of a foreign brand in China.

316
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,540
This Ms. Song really

317
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,980
does everything so methodically.

318
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,620
It's too early for you to feel proud.

319
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,940
You're still one step behind.

320
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,920
You need to step up
and make the official announcement soon.

321
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,020
I know. No need for you to say.

322
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,300
Xingchen, what are you doing?
Are you busy?

323
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,900
Yeah, quite overwhelmed.

324
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,180
I contacted the agency.

325
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,340
Tomorrow
is their agency proposal meeting.

326
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,334
I'm currently working on the proposal.

327
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,300
You also need to eat
when you prepare a proposal, right?

328
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,340
Grandpa is not at home tonight.

329
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,007
Come to my place.

330
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,150
I'll cook you a delicious meal.

331
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:52,860
(Maybe I can also
help provide some ideas)

332
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,940
(for your proposal.)

333
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,380
Sure.

334
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,298
I'll pick you up in the evening then.

335
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,980
Let me tell you.

336
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,500
Men need to be a bit clingy.

337
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,620
So you've learned everything.

338
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,900
Yes, I no longer need you.

339
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,900
Okay.

340
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,100
From now on, whoever asks me for help

341
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,260
is a dog.

342
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,429
How's the preparation of the materials?

343
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:45,620
I'm combining
the customer's personal experiences

344
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:47,540
with the domestic market environment.

345
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,740
It can maybe
highlight the advantages of our store.

346
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,723
I need to go over it in my mind
a few more times.

347
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,740
Then go over it a few more times.

348
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:56,690
Wait for my delicious food
to give you a boost.

349
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Captain Su.

350
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,340
Do you have something to say?

351
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,340
Today,

352
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,220
Lu Qun asked me a question.

353
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,780
What did he ask?

354
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,860
He asked how far we've progressed

355
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,740
and whether
I'm considered your boyfriend.

356
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,700
(He's such an unromantic man,)

357
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,060
(asking such a question at this time.)

358
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,900
Considering your sincerity,

359
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:42,014
I've decided
to give it some serious thought.

360
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,220
Why do you need to think about it?

361
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,520
How long do you need to think?

362
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,180
What do you think?

363
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,720
Give yourself some time.

364
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,860
Think it over yourself.

365
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,780
Fool.

366
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,300
I'll go to the bathroom.

367
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,580
Grandpa?

368
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:06,872
Why are you here?

369
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,220
Su Qingche.

370
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,220
Did you drink too much? Where's Mengnan?

371
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,900
Su Qingche.

372
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,740
Do you know what she does?

373
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,889
She sells women's underwear.

374
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,938
Have you drunk too much?

375
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,730
Stop messing around.

376
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,740
I'm not drunk.

377
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,420
Keep it down.

378
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,420
I came to find you.

379
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:26,340
What do you want?

380
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,900
Tell me.
Where am I inferior to Song Xingchen?

381
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,180
I'm younger and prettier than her.

382
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,140
I have so many fans.

383
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,380
So many people like me.

384
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,500
Stop messing around, okay?

385
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,140
No.

386
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,740
Stop it.

387
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,540
No.

388
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,363
I'm calling Mengnan now

389
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,400
to ask her to come pick you up.

390
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:39,930
No, don't.

391
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm not going anywhere today.

392
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,620
I'll stay here.

393
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,460
Alright, stop it. You...

394
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,500
When I was seven,

395
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
you held my hand for the first time.

396
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:50,749
Stop it. I don't know.

397
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,020
At 10,

398
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,980
right after summer vacation,

399
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,854
you carried me to school every day.

400
00:16:55,854 --> 00:16:57,200
That's because you broke your leg.

401
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:58,260
At 15,

402
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,940
you fought three bullies

403
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,380
to protect me.

404
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,020
Because they were actors you hired.

405
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,220
Qingche, you've changed.

406
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,900
Song Xingchen, that woman...

407
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,940
It seems like

408
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,460
I came at the wrong time today.

409
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:14,218
Xingchen. I...

410
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,620
Why are you here too?

411
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,100
Is this a place you can come?

412
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,460
Let go.

413
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,830
Xingchen, listen to my explanation.

414
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:19,300
No need.

415
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,300
Xingchen.

416
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,580
Xingchen, don't leave. Xingchen.

417
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
Qingyin, let go of me.

418
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,289
Don't leave, Xingchen.

419
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,130
I'm very busy these days.

420
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,316
You should take care of her first.

421
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:28,520
Qingyin, can you please let go?

422
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:29,020
Xingchen.

423
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,620
Qingyin, release me, okay?

424
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,740
Let go.

425
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,540
Now.

426
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,420
(Liang Bin)

427
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,620
Hello?

428
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,032
(Hello, old classmate.)

429
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,740
Our company

430
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,780
has a very important proposal meeting
tomorrow.

431
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
I want you to come
and help me with an assessment.

432
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,927
I can't make it.

433
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,630
There's also a meeting
at school tomorrow.

434
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,447
(Don't be so heartless. How about this?)

435
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,820
(I'm sending the evaluation proposal)

436
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,780
(to you now.)

437
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,500
(Take a look.)

438
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,100
Alright, send it to me.

439
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,280
(Proposal Agent Flow Chart)

440
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,960
(Agent: R&N Store / Stardust Rogue)

441
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,540
(How about it?)

442
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,538
I'll be on time tomorrow.

443
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,040
(Alright,
let's meet at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.)

444
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,860
Okay.

445
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,780
Please come in.

446
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,980
Is she the famous boss?

447
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,460
She's very experienced in agency work.

448
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,420
Looks like she's our biggest competitor.

449
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,020
Mr. Liang.

450
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,540
Ms. Song.

451
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,100
Are you ready?

452
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,940
Miss Wanru.

453
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,940
Mr. Liang, long time no see.

454
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,660
It's my honor to have you here.

455
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Let me introduce.

456
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,500
Miss Wanru's company

457
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,420
will also participate in this bidding.

458
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,100
We will, of course, select the best.

459
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,940
Also, Miss Wanru
is experienced in this field.

460
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:02,232
You need to work hard. Ms. Song.

461
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,860
Certainly.

462
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,460
Even without Miss Wanru,

463
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,820
we will do our best.

464
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,420
Alright, don't just stand there.

465
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,580
Let's get ready to start.

466
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,700
Professor Tang.

467
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:14,363
Please help me with the review.

468
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
Don't lose focus.

469
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,700
Women

470
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,180
are always bound by various labels.

471
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,740
Height, weight, and appearance

472
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,180
are all subjects of discussion.

473
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,020
Female products

474
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,980
can occupy a place

475
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,220
in the complex market.

476
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,260
It is because

477
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,620
they helped solve the above problems
for women.

478
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,967
(Domestic female products market)
But as the market develops,

479
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,356
products are continuously optimized,

480
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,180
and the choices keep increasing.

481
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,740
The customer base for female products

482
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,180
is no longer limited

483
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,900
to the practicality of a single product.

484
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,100
Campaign concepts, packaging design,

485
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,460
and practicality....

486
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,380
Mr. Su, why are you here?

487
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,020
I came to pick her up.

488
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,420
Professor Tang.

489
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,380
Why are you here?

490
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,260
This place doesn't look like a class.

491
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,460
LYS' person in charge
is my university roommate.

492
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,860
He asked me to come
and help analyze the plan.

493
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Why haven't you left yet?

494
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,620
I met Mr. Su.

495
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,780
So I chatted for a bit.

496
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,100
Thank you for today.

497
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,949
It's just a small favor.

498
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,460
Xingchen.

499
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,814
I have something to tell you.

500
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,100
Sorry, I'm busy today.

501
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,340
Let's talk in a couple of days.

502
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,500
Xiaoli, let's go.

503
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,723
What's going on with them?

504
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,780
A couple's quarrel.

505
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,780
Let's not get involved.

506
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,356
After all, we're all outsiders.

507
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,100
Do you agree?

508
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,620
Xingchen.

509
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,580
Xingchen.

510
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
What do you want?

511
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,500
I just want
to make things clear with you.

512
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,340
Gao Qingyin was drunk.

513
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
So don't take

514
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,580
what she said too seriously.

515
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,596
You don't need to say more.

516
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:31,820
When she said it yesterday,

517
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,300
you already explained it clearly.

518
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,100
But you're still mad at me now.

519
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,140
No one gets angry

520
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,340
because of some childhood memories.

521
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,140
However,

522
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:41,301
a girl who has liked you all along

523
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:42,705
came into your house late at night.

524
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:44,080
Shouldn't I digest it a bit?

525
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,134
I'm not a saint.

526
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,100
The reason I gave the password
to Gao Qingyin

527
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,900
is because Grandpa is getting old.

528
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,010
I'm afraid he'll forget the password.

529
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,620
That's all.

530
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,500
What is this?

531
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,940
This is the new password.

532
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,780
I changed the password.

533
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,940
From now on,

534
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,100
if I'm not here,

535
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,660
I'll let Grandpa ask you for it.

536
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,960
I feel more at ease.

537
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,916
But he doesn't know
about our relationship.

538
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,020
I'm also waiting for your reply.

539
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,940
I accept the little heart.

540
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,060
But about us,

541
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,334
let's see how you perform.

542
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,380
Where are you going? I'll drive you.

543
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,763
Who folded the little heart?

544
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,500
I asked Lu Qun to fold it for me.

545
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,240
(Stardust Rogue)

546
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,180
It's almost time.

547
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,859
Why hasn't the email arrived yet?

548
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,709
Stay calm.
Good things come to those who wait.

(LYS global headquarters)

550
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,740
(LYS: Your proposal)

551
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,100
(has passed a number of evaluations
by LYS headquarters.)

552
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,716
(Congratulations to Stardust Rogue)

553
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:02,060
(for being selected
as the brand agent in China.)

554
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,552
(I'm very happy to cooperate with you
in the future.)

555
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,220
I'm very happy to cooperate with you
in the future.

556
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,820
Congratulations to Stardust Rogue.

557
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
We finally got the agency.

558
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,980
Ms. Song, you deserve the credit.

559
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,500
This also has your credit.

560
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,620
Next,

561
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,220
we're going to shoot the store

562
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,340
for LYS' products.

563
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,380
I'll leave the model to you.

564
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,620
Leave it to me.

565
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,820
Go.

566
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,500
Yes.

567
00:23:29,752 --> 00:23:32,189
(Tang Ruize: Congratulations
on your triumphant start.)

568
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:33,540
(Song Xingchen: Thank you.)

569
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
(Song Xingchen: Thank you.)

570
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,500
By the way, I have a question for you.

571
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,820
You chose Stardust Rogue

572
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,425
as the agent for the domestic market.

573
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,860
Why is that?

574
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,580
Because Ms. Song's proposal

575
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,140
happened to hit the key points.

576
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,060
So the company's top management thinks

577
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,620
that is the best choice.

578
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,060
That's good.

579
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,820
Are you happy now?

580
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,820
By the way,

581
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:14,900
in the middle of all this,

582
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,100
there was actually an incident.

583
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,105
I haven't told you yet.

584
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,700
About that Wanru,

585
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,100
she invited me to dinner separately

586
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,236
and talked to me
about commission matters.

587
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,340
That happened?

588
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,632
She touched something she shouldn't.

589
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,220
Yeah.

590
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,060
Look at Ms. Song.

591
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:33,420
After taking my business card,

592
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,980
she has never contacted me privately.

593
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,220
She just asked one of my subordinates

594
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,700
for a very detailed product report.

595
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,420
Based on this, I really feel

596
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,700
her attitude, quality, and ability

597
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,820
are indispensable.

598
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,860
She's that kind of person.

599
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,185
Either she doesn't do it,

600
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,429
or she does it the best.

601
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,780
Your choice won't be wrong.

602
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,900
You should have told me earlier

603
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,900
that she's
your unforgettable first love.

604
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,380
Throughout this whole process,

605
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,500
I haven't heard you

606
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,300
say anything for Ms. Song.

607
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,540
She has the ability.

608
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,940
This doesn't
match the brand's tone at all.

609
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,420
This looks old.

610
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,260
This doesn't look vibrant.

611
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,540
Ms. Song.

612
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,660
According to your requirements
and budget,

613
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,992
all the available slots are here.

614
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,220
Okay, let me take another look.

615
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,260
Sure, I'll go to the restroom.

616
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,680
If you need anything, just call me.

617
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,180
Okay.

618
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,860
Ms. Han.

619
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,060
How is it?

620
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,580
We finally got the brand agency.

621
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,538
This is the first product photo
to be released.

622
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,843
We mustn't make any mistakes
in the details.

623
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,060
The models she found are different

624
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,100
from what I envisioned.

625
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,460
Is it that serious?

626
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,300
What's wrong?

627
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,140
They're not suitable at all.

628
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:43,149
Take a look for yourself.

629
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,700
I think it's okay.

630
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:52,490
What kind of feeling do you really want?

631
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,820
The theme is natural.

632
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,160
So, the model I want

633
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,250
should not only be beautiful

634
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,363
but also have an affinity.

635
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,460
It's best if she has

636
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,060
a cute and girlish feeling.

637
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,060
I see.

638
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,450
By the way, I suddenly remembered
a junior from my university days.

639
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,687
She works as a model agent.

640
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,660
How about I ask her?

641
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,780
Sure.

642
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,460
But you have to remember.

643
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
We're doing packaging
for intimate care products.

644
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,461
The tone must be fresh and natural.

645
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:18,200
Avoid those models

646
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,920
with noses higher than their foreheads.

647
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,660
Got it.

648
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,460
Leave it to me.

649
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,425
Trust my aesthetics.

650
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,420
Alright.

651
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,060
Now that you said it,

652
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,701
these models really don't seem suitable.

653
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,540
Exactly.

654
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,720
(Fubang Holdings)

655
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,300
Che, what are you doing?

656
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,740
Have you eaten?

657
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,100
Do you miss me?

658
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,820
I was shooting outside today

659
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,380
under the scorching sun.

660
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,860
Look, my skin is all red.

661
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,540
It's really painful.

662
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:54,160
It'll only get better if you kiss it.

663
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,580
Qingyin, are you dating Qingche?

664
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,780
No.

665
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,780
Then why did you go,

666
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,980
"I miss you,"

667
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,500
"Kiss."

668
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,300
And now, you're giving him a nickname.

669
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,300
It's called tactics.

670
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,660
Recently,

671
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,820
I've looked at so many accounts
of relationship bloggers.

672
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,980
Now it's trendy
to give your man a nickname.

673
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,410
Calling him Qingche

674
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,985
is just a habit
I developed since I was a child.

675
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,700
Now I can have

676
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,700
a romantic relationship with him.

677
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,100
I want to change

678
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,580
my image as his sister in his mind.

679
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,140
Starting now,

680
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,620
I want him to see me as a woman.

681
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,540
(Alice: Urgent Need! One product model
in Haicheng. Photo shoot tomorrow.)

682
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,180
(Amy: What product is it?)

683
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,820
(Alice: It's a female intimate store
called "Stardust Rogue".)

684

Mengnan.

685
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,260
We'll take on this job.

686
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,980
I'd like to meet this Ms. Song.

687
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,300
We need to be careful.

688
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,380
Ensure safety first.

689
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,820
Xiaoli.

690
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,140
The model we originally booked

691
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,380
still hasn't arrived.

692
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:24,740
We only rented the studio

693
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,900
for three hours today.

694
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,820
What's going on?

695
00:28:27,178 --> 00:28:28,654
(Wait a moment. Let me confirm.)

696
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,060
Okay, hurry up then.

697
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,020
Qingyin, we're here.

698
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,780
Why the rush? Wait a bit longer.

699
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:52,940
But

700
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,540
there isn't much time left
until the shoot.

701
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,540
Being on time is not considered late.

702
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,500
True.

703
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,500
This job pays little, but it has
a lot of work and high demands.

704
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,220
We even had to snatch it
from other models.

705
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,460
All because of Song Xingchen?

706
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,580
Isn't that reason enough?

707
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,900
This morning,

708
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
I even did special skincare and lifting.

709
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,060
How is it?

710
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,220
As beautiful as a goddess.

711
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,100
Look at the texture of my skin

712
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,900
and my perfect lines.

713
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,540
I want her
to know the difference between us.

714
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,740
I want her to realize she's hopeless.

715
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,540
Who's in charge here?

716
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,340
Why is she here?

717
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:52,814
What are you doing here?

718
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,020
For work, of course.

719
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,100
Work?

720
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,820
Are you today's model?

721
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,100
I'm today's model.

722
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,454
You don't welcome me?

723
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,900
Welcome, of course.

724
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,100

00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:11,170
Let's prepare to start.

727
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,847
This is the first set.

728
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:20,740
Go and try it on.

730
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,380
Hello?

731
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,460
(Is she there?)

732
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Miss, how did you arrange this?

733
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,720
The person who came is Gao Qingyin.

734
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,716
I'm really speechless.

735
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,580
What? Su Qingche's sister?

736
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,020
Wait.

737
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,740
I contacted my high school junior.

738
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,980
Well, let it be.

739
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,900
I hope she has good business skills.

740
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,180
It's too late to change now.

741
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,916
(Let's try this for now.)

742
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:57,420
Okay.

743
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,629
Finish up and come over
as soon as you're done.

744
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:00,967
Bye.

Also, it should be fresh,
natural, and enjoyable...

752
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:14,860
Wait.

753
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,100
After all,
it's a shoot for intimate care products.

754
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,100
The shooting environment is so noisy.

755
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,660
It will affect my performance.

756
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,780
What do you want to do then?

757
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,900
Let's have
the unrelated people leave first.

758
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,860
Excuse me, everyone.

759
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,040
Except for the photographer
and lighting director,

760
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,490
everyone else, take a break first.

761
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,260
Okay.

762
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,740
Can we start now?

763
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,220
Yes.

764
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,740
Let's begin.

765
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,900
(Open your eyes wide
and take a good look.)

766
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,180
(See who's truly the most beautiful?)

767
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,740
Wait a moment.

768
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,500
Miss Gao.

769
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,061
We want a sense of youthfulness.

770
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:06,620
You were a bit too exaggerated.

771
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,940
Relax a bit more.

772
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,980
(Youthfulness?)

773
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,700
(It's a piece of cake for me.)

774
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,738
This is the second set.

775
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,140
I don't want it. It's too ugly.

776
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,260
This is the simplest white dress.

777
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,220
Besides,

778
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,500
today's main focus is on the product,

779
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,220
not you.

780
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,940
Well, I won't trouble you then.

781
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,340
But the color of your clothes

782
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,380
won't blend well with the background.

783
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,100
It won't harmonize.

784
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,820
I know you don't understand,

785
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:45,294
so consider this a lesson for you.

786
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:47,940
Yes.

787
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,020
Is this acceptable?

788
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,020
It's alright.

789
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,740
Xingchen.

790
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,739
We agreed on three hours,

791
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,880
but the progress is too slow.

792
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:06,140
We might exceed the time limit.

793
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,700
I know.

794
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,020
Let's get it done soonest.

795
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,820
Sure.

796
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,420
Qingyin, let's get you changed.

797
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,860
What's the rush?

798
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,480
(Dominant Guy Falls For Me)

799
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,540
Che.

800
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,260
I caught a cold from the shoot today,

801
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:45,338
and I have a slight fever.

802
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,900
Can you pick me up after work?

803
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,080
(Studio 1)

804
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,260
I'm here.

805
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,040
How's it going? Which set are we on?

806
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,740
You're finally here.

807
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,260
We have one more set to go.

808
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,940
Where is she?

809
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,740
She's changing.

810
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,487
Leave the rest to me.

811
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:39,338
Go and take a break.

812
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,340
Great. I can't feel my legs anymore.

813
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,100
I'm leaving.

814
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,060
Sure. Go ahead.

815
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,740
The theme for our next set is nature.

816
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,180
We want a fresh image

817
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,180
and a dynamic vibe.

818
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,540
Who are you?

819
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,980
I'm one of Stardust Rouge's bosses.

820
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,047
I'll handle it from here.

821
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,060
By the way,

822
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,060
I'm also Song Xingchen's best friend.

823
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,327
(How dare you compete
with my best friend for Captain Lu.)

824
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,100
(Let me see)

825
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,780
(how capable you truly are.)

826
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,820
Do I need to repeat my request?

827
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,420
Who are you trying to scare?

828
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,100
I'm a professional.

829
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,860
I won't back down from your requests.

830
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,420
Fan and mist, please.

831
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,060
Stop it.

832
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,540
Are you trying to freeze me to death?

833
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,980
We seek to create an outdoor setting

834
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,020
graced by the gentle fall of rain.

835
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,540
We also promise
to end it as soon as possible.

836
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,860
Can't you do it, Miss Gao?

837
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,060
Let's continue then.

838
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,300
How's it going?

839
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,980
That's enough.

840
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,540
Let's not get her sick.

841
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,916
It's for business purposes.

842
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,272
Why does it seem
like you're settling a personal grudge?

843
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,180
Rest assured, I know what I'm doing.

844
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,180
Stop.

845
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,020
That's enough. It's too cold.

846
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:46,900
Why isn't there a break

847
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,500
for your shoot?

848
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,500
Are you trying to mess with me?

849
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,712
Here we go again.

850
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,580
So why did you take on this job?

851
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,505
We specifically mentioned that we

852
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:02,420
have a tight deadline.

853
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,940
And you must stand in front
of the fan for a long time.

854
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:06,610
We need a model with such experience.

855
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,660
Moreover, we'll pay extra.

856
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,180
I didn't read the agreement properly.

857
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,820
I'm sorry, Qingyin.

858
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,620
If you can't handle it,

859
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,580
I can have someone

860
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,540
to get me another model.

861
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,860
You're too tense now,

862
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,580
so the results aren't looking good.

863
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,740
No way.

864
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,900
I, Gao Qingyin,

865
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,740
have never given up on a shoot midway.

866
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,980
Don't tarnish my reputation

867
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,540
especially in front of Song Xingchen.

868
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,420
Sure.

869
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,700
Let's continue.

870
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,620
To be honest,

871
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,580
she's unexpectedly good.

872
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,180
I think so too.

873
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,780
She's indeed

874
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,500
youthful and energetic.

875
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,500
She doesn't need Botox for firm skin,
and she looks good

876
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,580
in every shoot.

877
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,003
Oh, give it a rest.

878
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,540
Compared to you back then,

879
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,620
she lacks slightly.

880
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,300
No, perhaps even half.

881
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,900
Appearance is also
a part of her ability.

882
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
I must say

883
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,574
that Qingche
has a decent childhood sweetheart.

884
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,500
What? Are you feeling threatened now?

885
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,620
Not to the extent

886
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,020
of fighting with a young lady.

887
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,840
(Studio 1)

888
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,020
Song Xingchen is an assertive

889
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,860
and sly woman.

890
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,299
Her best friend, too,

891
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,163
is as annoying
as the shop assistant last time.

892
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:31,570
Birds of a feather flock together. I'm exhausted.

893
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,140
I told you not to push yourself.

894
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,540
Hurry up.

895
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,860
Get changed and take a warm bath.

896
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,600
Let's not delay your schedule tomorrow.

897
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,425
This is a matter of a woman's dignity.

898
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,260
I won't let her treat me as a joke.

899
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,380
Qingyin.

900
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,967
I'm not trying to nag at you,

901
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,185
but aren't you acting a little

902
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,020
too subtle?

903
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,900
What do you mean?

904
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,900
First of all,

905
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,860
you are prettier and younger

906
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,660
than her,

907
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,580
but what if

908
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,860
she is Qingche's type?

909
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,140
No way.

910
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,360
(Qingche: How are you feeling?
Where are you?)

911
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,120
(Qingyin: Yongkang Street No. 23)

912
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,780
I still have a trump card.

913
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,260
Watch closely.
It's time for me to make a move.

914
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,100
Zip all these photos
and email them to me.

915
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,900
We'll decide which color tone
will look good after retouching.

916
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:30,356
This one looks good.

917
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,140
Song Xingchen.

918
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,820
What's up?

919
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,580
After giving it some thought,

920
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,740
I think I should
clarify matters with you.

921
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,700
What matters?

922
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,060
Qingche belongs to me.

923
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,700
I hope you won't bother him anymore.

924
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,340
Don't you have any shame?

925
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:51,980
It's fine.

926
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,316
Thanks for the hard work.

927
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,540
Let's call it a day and pack up.

928
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,460
Go and help them tidy up.

929
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,580
Anyway,
I wanted to have a chat with her.

930
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,618
Sure. Call me if you need anything.

931
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,860
This is the main purpose of your visit,
isn't it?

932
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,980
Qingche promised to marry me.

933
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,740
If it weren't
for your sudden appearance,

934
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,220
he wouldn't have abandoned me.

935
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,420
Marry you?

936
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,260
Are you two engaged?

937
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,380
Of course.

938
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:30,341
Our parents know each other, and we are

939
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,374
in an arranged marriage.

940
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,980
You see,

941
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,460
I'm pretty and outstanding.

942
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,300
Qingche treats me well too.

943
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,900
You better give up on him soon.

944
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,380
Girl.

945
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,380
The adult world is not as you imagine.

946
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,140
I can't help it that Su Qingche

947
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,460
likes me.

948
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,260
Is it normal for adults

949
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,580
to two-time their partner?

950
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,580
Despite entangling with your ex,

951
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
you flirt with Qingche.

952
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,740
Before understanding the truth,

953
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:17,760
don't talk nonsense.

954
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,716
Whether or not Su Qingche chooses you,

955
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,980
you shouldn't come to me.

956
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,940
You should settle it with him.

957
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:23,940
Understand?

958
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,220
Hi.

959
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,220
Is this Studio 12?

960
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,860
Yes.

961
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,360
Are you still shooting?

962
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,940
Qingche.

963
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,220
Here to pick me up?

964
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,780
How are you feeling?

965
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,860
Did you cooperate with the team?

966
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,540
Of course, I did.

967
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,620
Look.

968
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,980
I think I'm catching a cold.

969
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:43,820
Qingche.

970
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,860
Touch my forehead.

971
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,660
Am I having a fever?

972
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:47,900
Let me check.

973
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,538
You don't have a fever.

974
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,260
You shouldn't call him by his name.

975
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,700
You should call him Mr. Su.

976
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,460
What brings you here, Xiaoli?

977
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,589
Is Xingchen here too?

978
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,820
Xingchen, I...

979
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,020
It was a coincidence.

980
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,140
I happened to meet Xingchen
for a shoot today,

981
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,380
so I worked really hard.

982
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
Let me explain.

983
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,952
Qingyin told me she wasn't feeling well

984
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,905
and might have a fever,

985
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,900
so she asked me to come.

986
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,120
I came because of that.

987
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,367
I didn't know you were here too.

988
00:42:29,374 --> 00:42:30,180
Otherwise...

989
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,300
It's normal.

990
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,180
I don't have to report my whereabouts
to you.

991
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:37,820
Erm.

992
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,260
Did she cause you any trouble?

993
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,980
No.

994
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,300
Miss Gao is very capable.

995
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,087
We would've had a smooth cooperation...

996
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,620
if not for your sudden appearance.

997
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,180
Xingchen.

998
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,300
In terms of work,

999
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,140
I've sincerely
completed the task for you.

1000
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,520
You better not turn things around.

1001
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,180
Be professional at work.

1002
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,860
If you have other questions,

1003
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,007
please pick the right time.

1004
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,740
Aren't you here to pick someone up?

1005
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:00,800
Take her away quickly.

1006
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:02,690
That's not it. Xingchen, listen to me.

1007
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,660
Xiaoli.

1008
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,460
Talk to the photographer.

1009
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:06,778
Select the shots from today,

1010
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:08,203
and we'll have them retouched later.

1011
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,820
Go ahead. Leave the rest to me.

1012
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,260
Bye.

1013
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,300
Xingchen.

1014
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,660
Since we're here,

1015
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,340
why not let Qingche
give you a ride on the way?

1016
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,460
No, thank you.

1017
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,900
Xingchen.

1018
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:21,820
Xingchen.

1019
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,460
Qingche.

1020
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,260
Qingyin.

1021
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,300
I treat you as my sister.

1022
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,825
