(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 12=

24
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,220
Xingchen.

25
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,540
Xingchen, it's raining.

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,420
Let me take you back.

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,300
No need.

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,283
Qingyin is eagerly waiting

29
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:51,340
for you to drive her home.

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,578
I won't trouble you
to take a detour for me again.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,440
I really didn't know
she was lying to me.

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,260
Is that so?

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,087
It seems you're not doing your duty

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,250
as her childhood sweetheart.

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,603
You don't know her well enough.

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,530
Are you mad again?

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,100
Why am I mad?

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,940
With my budget,

39
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,580
I can't afford a model at her level.

40
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,980
It's thanks to you.

41
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,620
I really didn't know

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,060
why she would be here.

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,180
Did something happen?

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,100
You can tell me.

45
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,167
You can tell me everything.

46
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,860
Captain Su.

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,660
If you're already

48
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,180
engaged to another women,

49
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,180
you shouldn't date someone else.

50
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,020
Engaged?

51
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,500
Who's engaged?

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,260
How could I...

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,700
She's a girl.

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,460
It's unlikely for her

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,654
to tell such a lie in public.

56
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,660
I swear.

57
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,700
I don't have
any engagement promises with her.

58
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,620
I don't know which of your words is true

59
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,421
and which is false.

60
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,900
But if you really want to be with me,

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,020
please first deal with Qingyin.

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,540
There's nothing between me and her.

63
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,654
What do I need to deal with?

64
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,460
Why did you come?

65
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,860
Madam Hu told me you were here.

66
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,458
She asked me to pick you up on my way.

67
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,580
Xingchen.

68
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,780
You have to trust me.

69
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,900
I have other things to do.
Let's talk later.

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,580
Are you okay?

71
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,940
It's my first time seeing you so upset.

72
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,820
It's nothing.

73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,860
Why would my mom ask you to come?

74
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,101
Of course, I have
to attend Professor Song's birthday.

75
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,520
Madam Hu said you were here,

76
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:33,590
so she asked me
to give you a ride home for dinner.

77
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,359
I'm too busy today.

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,380
I forgot to buy a gift.

79
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,460
Cake and flowers.

80
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,640
I've prepared them for you.

81
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:40,980
Thank you.

82
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,690
Just a small effort.

83
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,380
Xingchen.

84
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,140
It's your dad's birthday,

85
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,900
and you forgot
about such an important occasion.

86
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,540
Luckily, Tang reminded you.

87
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,740
Dad, I'm sorry.

88
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,940
Here are some flowers for you.

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,700
Wishing you a happy birthday.

90
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,780
Look, my daughter cares about me.

91
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,779
This is a gift for you, Professor Song.

92
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,020
Wishing you a happy birthday.

93
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,300
Thank you, Tang.

94
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,403
I'll put it here.

95
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,780
Come.

96
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,180
Let's skip the formalities.

97
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,540
Start digging in.

98
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,980
Come.

99
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,980
Let's eat.

100
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,940
I remember this shrimp.

101
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,540
I remember back in school,

102
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,400
Xingchen would bring

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,980
this shrimp dish you made to school.

104
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:27,374
Every time, I could finish it all.

105
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,260
You still remember. That's nice.

106
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,940
Here. Your favorite.

107
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,620
Eat more. I'm on a diet.

108
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,780
If you keep dieting,
you'll become a pole.

109
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,940
Parents always
see their children as thin.

110
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,740
Besides, I'm on a healthy diet.

111
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm just
controlling excessive fat intake.

112
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,940
Madam Hu.

113
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,460
Xingchen usually takes good care
of her health.

114
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
As long as she's mindful.

115
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,574
How about this?

116
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,820
I suggest we toast Professor Song.

117
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,060
Wishing him a happy birthday
and good health.

118
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,540
- Alright.
- Come.

119
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,945
Dad, happy birthday.

120
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,380
Happy birthday.

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,083
Thank you.

122
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,940
Professor Song.

123
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,643
You have to say a few words.

124
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,698
What should I say?

125
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,660
Understood.

126
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,540
Let me make a birthday speech.

127
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,580
Well, today is my birthday,

128
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,380
and I'm very happy that you all came

129
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,420
to celebrate with me.

130
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,020
Time flies.

131
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,660
In the blink of an eye, I'm almost 60.

132
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,380
Xingchen.

133
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,020
My dear daughter.

134
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,340
What worries me the most right now,

135
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,020
firstly,

136
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,380
is your body.

137
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,620
Secondly,

138
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,900
whether you'll be lonely.

139
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,580
You don't want to get married.

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,980
I...

141
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,820
I respect your opinion.

142
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,020
But think about it carefully.

143
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Your mom and I

144
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,100
will leave you someday.

145
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
You'll be all alone.

146
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,300
If you...

147
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,900
If you're all alone, I'll be...

148
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,980
Dad.

149
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,540
What are you talking about?

150
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,900
Can you stop worrying needlessly?

151
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,980
You're acting like
a sentimental teenager.

152
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,100
Come.

153
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,620
We're quite old now,

154
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,610
yet you're still quite emotional.

155
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,780
Xingchen.

156
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,340
Your dad is right.

157
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,660
That's what I'm worried about too.

158
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,260
So,

159
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,820
you hurry up

160
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,380
and find a boyfriend.

161
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,140
After that,

162
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,300
let me have some grandchildren.

163
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,260
I'll take care of them.

164
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,100
Rest assured.

165
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,580
I will definitely find a boyfriend.

166
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,780
Have you found a suitable one?

167
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,820
Back then,

168
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,660
Tang made the standards quite high.

169
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,140
If you want to find someone

170
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,220
better than him,

171
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,152
it'll be difficult.

172
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,780
Madam Hu.

173
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,580
Xingchen has grown up.

174
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,180
I absolutely
trust her judgment and decision.

175
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,300
No matter what choice she makes,

176
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,620
I can accept it.

177
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,860
Good.

178
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,860
I love hearing that.

179
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,180
Come.

180
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,180
Once again,
happy birthday, Professor Song.

181
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,260
Thank you.

182
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,860
Happy birthday.

183
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,540
Thank you.

184
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,420
May I ask you a question?

185
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,180
Go ahead.

186
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,500
After me,

187
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,220
have you dated anyone new?

188
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,180
Why are you asking this?

189
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:47,716
I haven't dated anyone.

190
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,340
Regardless of what my parents say,

191
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,420
don't think too much.

192
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,660
We can only be friends.

193
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,043
A lifetime is a long time, isn't it?

194
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,020
Just like you're doing business now,

195
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,900
but you won't give up being a doctor.

196
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,660
Right?

197
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,290
What's your plan for the future?

198
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,780
I plan to pursue further studies

199
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,180
once Stardust Rogue is stable.

200
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,300
Since I resigned at this point,

201
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,694
I need a doctoral degree
to work in a public hospital.

202
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,900
You're so busy right now.

203
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:20,660
Will you have time to prepare for exams?

204
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,003
The school I applied to isn't
admitting students this year.

205
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,580
When I'm done with this busy period,

206
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,660
I'll take my time to prepare

207
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,520
and see if there's
an opportunity next year.

208
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:28,887
After all, I'm your dad's student,

209
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,260
almost like a family member.

210
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,229
If you need anything,
feel free to tell me anytime.

211
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,380
(Su Qingche)

212
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,660
Goodbye, then.

213
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,620
Xingchen.

214
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,300
I just want you to remember.

215
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,500
No matter what you do,

216
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,460
I will support you.

217
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,220
I'm leaving.

218
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,780
Good night.

219
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,820
(Su Qingche)

220
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,100
(Today's Moments)

221
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,700
Come in.

222
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,660
Professor Tang.

223
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,660
Are you busy?

224
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,900
I'm reading your paper.

225
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,661
Have a seat.

226
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,180
Do you think

227
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,060
I will pass this time?

228
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,181
What do you think?

229
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,740
I think I can.

230
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,900
Every day, I must go to Xingchen's shop

231
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,832
to help out for free.

232
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,820
I've written this for days.

233
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,100
In that case,

234
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,140
you're not working hard enough.

235
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,860
Come on, Uncle Ruize.

236
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,460
Give me a break.

237
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,460
I heard

238
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,780
Great Aunt Xiaofang is on your side.

239
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,420
Xingchen is just confused

240
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,900
by Qingche now.

241
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,180
I'll help you
bring her back to her senses.

242
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,620
Are you trying to please me now?

243
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,060
How can you call this pleasing?

244
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,500
It's just a simple request.

245
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,980
You don't have to worry

246
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,661
about my affair with Xingchen.

247
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,580
She has her own choices and judgments.

248
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,730
Don't cause trouble.

249
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,540
Very well.

250
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,580
Your thesis

251
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
may be far from my expectations,

252
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,500
but as an elective course,

253
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,060
you'll pass.

254
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,140
Really?

255
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,540
I'll get going, then.

256
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,220
Go ahead.

257
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,220
Uncle Ruize?

258
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,620
Have a look.

259
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,500
These are the photos I selected
from yesterday.

260
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,340
These are not bad.

261
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,870
Great for our homepage promotion.

262
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,100
I'll send them for editing.

263
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,580
Sure.

264
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,220
By the way,

265
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,134
how was your dad's birthday yesterday?

266
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,500
With his favorite student present,

267
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,380
he was elated.

268
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,740
Tang Ruize was there too?

269
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,780
Oh, my.

270
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,500
He's making great strides.

271
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,300
Things have turned this way eventually.

272
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,660
Are you catching up on a drama?

273
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,380
Anything is possible.

274
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,820
What if the young one isn't reliable?

275
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,060
You might get back
with the elite in academia.

276
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,140
Besides,

277
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,820
Su Qingche's childhood sweetheart
caused trouble yesterday,

278
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,829
so he loses a point.

279
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
But did you ask him

280
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,941
about their arranged marriage?

281
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:44,460
Is it true?

282
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,140
He said it isn't.

283
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,060
But who knows

284
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,640
what actually happened?

285
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,980
Babe.

286
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,660
I think it's right for you
to observe him now.

287
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,494
His childhood sweetheart
appeared this time,

288
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,900
but who knows
if someone else will appear next?

289
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,980
I've been overwhelmed
by our business lately.

290
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,367
I'm too exhausted to handle this.

291
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,260
True.

292
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,460
We've almost

293
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,740
cleared our stock.

294
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,380
After taking over LYS,

295
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,300
shouldn't we also

296
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,196
revamp the studio?

297
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,540
The items on display should be replaced

298
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,020
to align with the brand's image.

299
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,105
You're right.

300
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,501
We should get this place renovated.

301
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,700
As for the rest,

302
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,060
we can settle them ourselves.

303
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Sounds good.

304
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,740
I think

305
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,380
these walls

306
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,020
should be repainted.

307
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,780
We might also need

308
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,140
to get some carpentry work done.

309
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,700
Perhaps I should

310
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,460
ask if anyone

311
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,620
around us is willing to help.

312
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,980
Sure. Go ahead.

313
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,130
I'll tidy this place up.

314
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,460
Sure.

315
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,040
(Han Xiaoli: Looking for helpers

(Han Xiaoli: Looking for helpers
for shop renovation. Limited budget.)

317
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,620
Ms. Han.
Are you looking for renovation helpers?

318
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,940
(I volunteer.)

319
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,220
Are you sure you can?

320
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,900
Remember what you did

321
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,460
to my house?

322
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,540
It's a different case this time.

323
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,260
This job isn't as difficult.

324
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,940
Moreover,

325
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,220
I can get you more help.

326
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,820
Most importantly,

327
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
we don't ask for pay.

328
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:39,980
Alright.

329
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,140
I'll reluctantly
trust you one more time.

330
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,340
Wait for me.

331
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,820
I found someone.

332
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,940
So soon?

333
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,180
Who is it?

334
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,780
Lu Qun.

335
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,460
He said he'll get more people to help.

336
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,500
Lu Qun?

337
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,780
I've noticed that this name

338
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,220
has been popping up in your life
frequently lately.

339
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,980
What's going on?

340
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,980
What?

341
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,580
Are you the only one who can date?

342
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,860
Why can't we

343
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,220
test things out as friends?

344
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,420
Of course, you can.

345
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,860
Anyway, I feel something is off.

346
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,300
It's normal, though.

347
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,740
Should I put this here?

348
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,660
When are they coming?

353
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,660
Let me tell you.

Your chance is here.

355

Song Xingchen is renovating her shop,

356
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,980
and they need helpers. Let's go.

357
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,780
I'm busy. I can't.

358
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,580
I'm telling you.

359
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,740
If you come with me,

360
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,981
you'll find out her feelings
toward her ex-boyfriend.

361
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,260
But if you don't,

362
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,620
you'll overthink

363
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,460
and end up breaking up with her.

364
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,500
I don't want to know

365
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,700
how she feels toward her ex.

366
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,260
I have a temper too.

367
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,020
Alright.

368
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,220
You have a temper,

369
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,180
but I've agreed that I'd go.

370
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,500
The boys will come with me later.

371
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,300

Aren't you busy?

375
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,527
I've done my work.

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,300
He'll treat us once we're done.

378
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,100
Great.

379
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,020
Is this enough?

380
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,060
It should be.

381
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,220
Bosses.

382
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,460
Polar Night is here.

383
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,980
You're here.

384
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,660
We'll definitely come
when Xingchen needs help.

385
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,540
Thank you, boys.

386
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,060
You're here too, Captain Su.

387
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,180
Boys.

388
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,100
Let's get started.

389
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,740
Alright.

390
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,420
Come on.

391
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,300
Oh, dear.

392
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,580
They aren't here to demolish the place,
are they?

393
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,700
Looks fine.

394
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,860
Take this.

395
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,020
I can tolerate anything

396
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,180
that happens to my outfit

397
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,180
but not my hair.

398
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,180
Zhou Yao.

399
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,260
Do you need help?

400
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,860
Don't worry about it, Xingchen.

401
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,260
Lu Qun, let me help.

402
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,460
I'm totally fine.

403
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,380
Are you sure?

404
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,340
Yes, I am.

405
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,140
Xie Yuan.

406
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,140
Need any help?

407
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,540
No worries. I'll do it.

408
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,420
Babe. Have some water.

409
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,460
No, thanks.

410
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,460
Give them to me.

411
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,900
Go and get some towels.

412
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,460
Sure.

413
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,060
Have some water. Pass Lin Mu one.

414
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,260
Sure. Thanks, Xingchen.

415
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,340
Zhou Yao. Have some water.

416
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,610
Thanks, Xingchen.

417
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,540
Lu Qun, have some water.

418
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,460
Thanks.

419
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,100
I'm fine.

420
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,065
You didn't drink, did you?

421
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,460
Zhou Yao.

422
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,701
Wipe your sweat.

423
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,660
Thanks.

424
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,740
Go ahead.

425
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,620
Wipe your sweat.

426
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,220
My hands are dirty.

427
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,860
Wipe your sweat too.

428
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,380
You stink even from far away.

429
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,580
I got dirt all over.

430
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,661
Why don't you help me?

431
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,060
That's enough.

432
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,060
Wipe it yourself.

433
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,300
You're considered wife material,
Ms. Song.

434
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:56,980
Lu.

435
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,540
Is that the girl

436
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,380
from the escape room
and the karaoke joint?

437
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,380
Yeah, that's her.

438
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,580
I just saw her blushing

439
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,260
when she saw you.

440
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,260
Seriously?

441
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Yeah, just now.

442
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,620
Alright, go on with your work.

443
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
(Stardust Rouge)

444
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,260
(Stardust Rouge)

445
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,272
Thirsty? Want some water?

446
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,500
Are you okay? Did it hit you?

447
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,796
Want to give me another shot?

448
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,980
Please be careful.

449
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,860
I'm sorry about yesterday.

450
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,140
Gao Qingyin told me she had a fever,

451
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,900
so I wanted to help if I could.

452
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:51,980
It was on my way anyway.

453
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,760
I don't even know if she was faking it.

454
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,949
Next time, I'll let Lu Qun handle it

455
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,900
in a similar situation.

456
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,260
I know.

457
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
She was playing tricks yesterday.

458
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,340
So...

459
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,552
Are you not angry?

460
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,300
Well, I'm still upset.

461
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,420
However, I'll forgive you

462
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,820
since you brought your friends

463
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,058
to work as laborers today.

464
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,981
What happened between you
and Tang Ruizhe last night?

465
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,820
Yesterday was my dad's birthday,

466
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,020
and he's my dad's student.

467
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,820
We just had dinner, nothing more.

468
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,060
You and him...

469
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,380
What's wrong with us?

470
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,620
One thing about me

471
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,100
is that I never look back.

472
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,620
An online show?

473
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,620
I've been quite busy lately.

474
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,220
What?

475
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,814
I can earn credits from it?

476
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,340
Alright.

477
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,500
I'll join.

478
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,620
Bro.

479
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,540
You made it.

480
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,100
Let me brief you on this.

481
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,260
This reality show
is called "Supermodel".

482
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,260
It features five new models

483
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,900
who are paired with five photographers.

484
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,170
Each pair will take 20 shots.

485
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,900
Unfortunately, one of the photographers

486
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:10,900
couldn't make it today,

487
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,820
so

488
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,040
I asked you to take his place.

489
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,020
Don't worry.

490
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,120
I'll seize this chance.

491
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,580
6,550 yuan in total.

492
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,660
Scan it.

493
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,060
What's wrong?

494
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,180
Who's the girl in black?

495
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,065
Do you know her?

496
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,540
No.

497
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,180
Gao Qingyin.

498
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,740
She and you are teammates.

499
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,060
She's a good model.

500
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,563
Give a good performance.

501
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,500
Mister.

502
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,940
Have we met somewhere?

503
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,180
You look a bit familiar.

504
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,916
How could you see me before?

505
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,780
We are complete strangers.

506
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,780
Quit pretending.

507
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,100
I recognized you at a glance

508
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,260
from the updated guest list.

509
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,220
You fooled me
at Song Xingchen's store last time.

510
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,860
Are you ready to settle the score today?

511
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,260
It's all a misunderstanding.

512
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,701
There's no misunderstanding here.

513
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,300
You're on Song Xingchen's side.

514
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,660
That makes you my enemy.

515
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,700
You and Xingchen...

516
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,380
She's making moves on my Qingche.

517
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,072
Wanna be my rival?
Her entire family will be implicated.

518
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:37,820
Su Qingche is your boyfriend?

519
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,900
If Xingchen hadn't messed things up,

520
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,305
we'd be a thing sooner or later.

521
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,780
Come on.

522
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,660
Whatever.

523
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,020
Well,

524
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,900
if you feel
I can't capture your essence well,

525
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,860
let's swap partners.

526
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,860
In your dreams.

527
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
Today, you're partnering with me.

528
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,420
Otherwise, I'll quit.

529
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,020
(Supermodel)

530
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,180
Ready?

531
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,260
Well,

532
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,300
if you manage a decent shot

533
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,540
for the theme,

534
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,476
I'll let it slide.

535
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,980
Brighten the lights slightly.

536
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,460
Three, two, one.

537
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,700
Again.

538
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,620
Get ready.

539
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Three, two, one.

540
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,340
What are you doing?

541
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,380
Can you keep it professional?

542
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,140
This show only eliminates photographers,

543
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
not models.

544
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,300
Got it?

545
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,140
Fine.

546
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,860
Tell me.

547
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,620
What does it take to get you on board?

548
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Help me out with Qingche.

549
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,660
No way.

550
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,740
Song Xingchen is my aunt.

551
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,300
If you mess with her,

552
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,134
we'll have a problem.

553
00:28:59,163 --> 00:28:59,752
For real?

554
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,047
She's your aunt?

555
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,020
Yes, genetically and all.

556
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,460
I thought you worked for her.

557
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,180
I never expected the family tie.

558
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,660
You're in deep trouble now.

559
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,100
Hurry up.

560
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,860
Time is ticking.

561
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,460
Okay,

562
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,860
that's how you want it?

563
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,580
I'll play along.

564
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,940
I...

565
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,860
Alright, that's enough.

566
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,940
I'm done.

567
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,900
Let me check.

568
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,700
These photos are not good.

569
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,580
You need to replace

570
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,940
a photographer like him.

571
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,060
I'm just the cameraman.

572
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,963
I don't handle these.

573
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,740
No.

574
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,460
These photos are ugly.

575
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,060
My career will take a nosedive
once the show airs.

576
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,940
Remember,

577
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,100
you chose the poses

578
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,140
and expressions.

579
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,380
No one forced you to do so.

580
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,527
Trying to stab me in my back?

581
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,740
If so, I can quit.

582
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,723
And you'll have

583
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,403
to bear the social shame later.

584
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,363
That's a wrap.

585
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,100
You...

586
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,620
(Supermodel)

587
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
Thanks to those photos,

588
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,860
you can expect a trip back to school.

589
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,220
Qiancheng.

590
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,820
Bro, I tried my best.

591
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,660
Blame it on Gao Qingyin.
She's a pain to work with.

592
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,300
What are you talking about?

593
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,260
The judges reviewed all the photos,

594
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,660
and your group scored the highest.

595
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,860
What?

596
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,740
They commented

597
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,340
there's a "first love" vibe.

598
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,260
It's pretty engaging.

599
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,140
First love?

600
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,220
Excuse me,

601
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,500
you can't be serious.

602
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,700
The PR department mentioned

603
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,820
they will promote your group's photos.

604
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,140
Don't forget me if you get famous.

605
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,380
I can't imagine how your otaku fans

606
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,140
will take these.

607
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,060
Oh, and...

608
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,700
Su Qingche.

609
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,660
You...

610
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,860
How is it?

611
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:14,900
You two.

612
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,500
Help.

613
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,700
This is so good.

614
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,020
Does this look good on me?

615
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,740
Mu, what brings you here too?

616
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,140
Who did you buy it for?

617
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,780
Stop teasing me.

618
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,699
Who did you buy it for?

619
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,520
Come snag it from me.

620
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,130
Give it to me.

621
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,500
I bought it for you.

622
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,020
It's for you, okay?

623
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,340
Girls.

624
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,287
Why are you all chilling by yourselves?

625
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,300
This is boring.

626
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,500
How about

627
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,540
you join me for some fun?

628
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,060
What's your problem?

629
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,980
Don't be so hostile.

630
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,700
You

631
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,380
look like my ex-girlfriend.

632
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,380
Since we have such a fate,

633
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,780
can I ask for your number?

634
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,100
What are you saying?

635
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Am I not pretty?

636
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,580
Why don't you ask for my number?

637
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,985
Let's see whether you can have it.

638
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,740
Why does it matter to you
if I talk to her?

639
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:03,940
Get lost.

640
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,927
Get lost before we give you a beatdown.

641
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,820
You.

642
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,380
Just wait.

643
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,620
Will he round up to get revenge?

644
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,340
He wouldn't dare.

645
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,660
What can he do to us in broad daylight?

646
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,500
Lucky you're here.

647
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,180
Otherwise,

648
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,740
we wouldn't dare to speak up.

649
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,780
It's terrifying.

650
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,700
Did we get stares
because we dressed too short today?

651
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,340
Cut the crap.

652
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,820
You did nothing wrong.

653
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,620
But many girls

654
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,740
don't know what to do

655
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,580
when this happens.

656
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,020
First,

657
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,420
learn to ask for help.

658
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,020
Next, learn to protect yourself.

659
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,980
I'll ask Captain Su

660
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,660
to organize a self-defense class.

661
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,980
I'll buy some pepper spray
from Xingchen.

662
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,860
Spray him.

663
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,540
He pissed me off.

664
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,620
He groped me.

665
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
Was it?

666
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,060
He groped me.

667
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,660
We need to clean up a bit later.

668
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,740
Next time,
we'll give everyone a proper shoutout.

669
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,309
Thanks, everyone.

670
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,340
You put in some good work.

671
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,060
Not a big deal.

672
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,420
We saw enough
lovey-dovey stuff this afternoon.

673
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,087
It seems like I'm off the hook
for treating dinner tonight.

674
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,260
No. Everyone's tired, right?

675
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,260
Yeah.

676
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,980
Then you hustle.

677
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,174
I'll take them out for dinner.

678
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,060
Thanks.

679
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,460
Call me if Polar Night needs help.

680
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:31,900
Let's go.

681
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
See you.

682
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,380
Bye, Xiaoli.

683
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,540
Captain Su.

684
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,580
This is a workplace.

685
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,380
You wouldn't want your team

686
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,140
to see you as unprofessional.

687
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,420
I can't help it.

688
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,220
How can I hold back my feelings for you?

689
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,860
How about we play a game?

690
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,883
Another one of your tricky ideas?

691
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,100
Let's see

692
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,540
who can hide their feelings for longer.

693
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:39,940
Well...

694
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,300
What does the winner get?

695
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
What do you think?

696
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,380
Rest assured. I'm a professional.

697
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,180
I don't believe it.

698
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

699
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,820
(Women's Self-Defense
Public Welfare Event Planning)

700
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,420
Listen up, everyone.

701
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,580
I'll start the briefing shortly.

702
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,740
Today's meeting is convened,

703
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,860
thanks to the Women's Federation.

704
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,060
They hope Polar Night

705
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,180
can host a public welfare event

706
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,780
on women's self-defense techniques.

707
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,180
We'll host this along with Team Sucheng.

708
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,980
So, the locations will be

709
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,410
in Sucheng and Haicheng respectively.

710
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,980
This is a rare opportunity,

711
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,580
relying on the public exposure

712
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,220
of our vaccine transportation
and daily rescue activities.

713
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,340
This is a chance to prove ourselves

714
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,740
and enhance our reputation.

715
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,940
Everyone must be spirited.

716
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,060
Yes!

717
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,660
I'll be in charge of Sucheng.

718
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,300
Captain Lu will lead in Haicheng.

719
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,580
As for the video recording in Haicheng,

720
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,620
any volunteers?

721
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,300
I can recommend a foreign aid.

722
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,060
Alright, that's settled.

723
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,300
As for other details,
Captain Lu will handle them.

724
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,690
If you have any questions,

725
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:07,340
you can ask him.

726
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,060
Dismissed.

727
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,660
Besides first-aid course,

728
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:14,370
I also want to participate

729
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,574
in the demonstration
of women's self-defense techniques.

730
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,780
Sure, I'll teach you then.

731
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Why not let me teach?

732
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,180
Got it.

733
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,380
Your voluntary service

734
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,458
is an absolute honor.

735
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,260
Miss.

736
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,660
Do you have an appointment?

737
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Missy.

738
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:49,860
I...

739
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,820
am Captain Lu's girlfriend.

740
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,860
That, I don't care.

741
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,500
You can't enter without an appointment.

742
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,780
Seriously?

743
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,140
I'm sorry, miss.

744
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,780
Without an appointment, you can't...

745
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,980
Captain Lu.

746
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:02,560
What's wrong?

747
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,420
Darling!

748
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,260
Who are you?

749
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,660
Who am I?

750
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,700
You're joking.

751
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,500
Ms. Chen, right? Why are you here?

752
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,580
Mr. Lu.

753
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,300
I missed you,

754
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,580
so I'm here.

755
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,540
Ms. Chen.

756
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,860
We'll talk this out,

757
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,700
but let me go first.

758
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,500
What are you doing?

759
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,380
You called me "babe" yesterday.

760
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,527
Why is it "Ms. Chen" today?

761
00:37:25,694 --> 00:37:28,060
When did I call you "babe"?

762
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,420
Do I even know you?

763
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,820
You held my hand.

764
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,260
Now, you want to let go?

765
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,980
I politely supported you last night.

766
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,780
That's not called holding hands.

767
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,060
Lu Qun.

768
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,260
What's the meaning of this?

769
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,900
You said
you wanted to hold my hand forever.

770
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,100
Are you playing with me?

771
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,930
Who confessed and asked me

772
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,138
to be his girlfriend yesterday?

773
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,500
Player's going to play, indeed.

774
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,500
Ms. Chen.

775
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,940
You've mistaken me for someone else.

776
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,700
Stay right here.

777
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,980
Help me out.

778
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,700
Dream on, womanizer.

779
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,900
I'm innocent.

780
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,060
Help me out, please.

781
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,300
Money!

782
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,540
How much?

783
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,352
A blank check.
Fill in whatever you like.

784
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,340
Lu Qun.

785
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,900
Who's this?

786
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,500
I'm his wife.

787
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,340
Wife?

788
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,060
Aren't you single?

789
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,820
We married on a whim.

790
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,580
On a whim.

791
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,540
This is for you.

792
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,460
Garbage.

793
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,149
Serves you right.

794
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,740
Nothing on your hands?

795
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Do something useful.

796
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,860
Flip some documents.

797
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,340
Quit idling around.

798
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,900
Is the training in place?

799
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,900
Will you pay up?

800
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,300
Of course.

801
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,380
How much?

802
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,660
Five hundred? Reasonable.

803
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Five thousand?

804
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,060
Isn't that too harsh?

805
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,980
I think, given our relationship,

806
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,220
we can be kinder.

807
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,500
Okay.

808
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,020
Done.

809
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,620
That's about right.

810
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,460
There it is. This works.

811
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,140
Captain Su.

812
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,260
Are you teaching today?

813
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,660
Xingchen said you signed up too.

814
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,420
Welcome.

815
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,540
I came early to familiarize myself.

816
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,420
Hey, nephew.

817
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,820
You're the foreign aid.

818
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,980
My rate is high.

819
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,639
If it weren't for Song Xingchen's sake,

820
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,780
I wouldn't have come.

821
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,100
Thanks.

822
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,300
Song Xingchen has briefed me earlier.

823
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,500
Now, I'll snap a few shots

824
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,780
and preview them on Weibo.

825
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,100
Show me some standard poses.

826
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,140
Is everyone ready?

827
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,900
Weiling, you go first.

828
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,620
Lin Mu.

829
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,980
Lin Mu, come over.

830
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,820
Lin Mu isn't here.

831
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,980
He's always on your mind.

832
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,100
No way.

833
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,740
Then, Lin, come over.

834
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,240
This is the over-the-shoulder throw.

835
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,620
Let me show you.

836
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,700
Feet parallel, shoulder-width apart.

837
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,300
Grab the wrist with your right hand.

838
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,620
Step forward and lift the back

839
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,620
onto your shoulder.

840
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
Engage your core and lift upward.

841
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,300
Got it?

842
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,580
Xingchen, Xiaoli.

843
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,060
Wanna have a try?

844
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,540
I'll do it.

845
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,140
Sure.

846
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,660
Now, who will be the bad guy?

847
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,940
I'll do it.

848
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,580
Me.

849
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,020
I will.

850
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,060
I can. Me!

851
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,740
Just kidding.

852
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,260
How playful of you guys.

853
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,340
I'll do it.

854
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,740
Use any method.

855
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:49,280
You just have to knock me down to win.

856
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,620
