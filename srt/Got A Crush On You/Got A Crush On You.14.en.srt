=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 14=

24
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,985
Good morning, Colonel.

25
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,260
Grandpa.

26
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,432
I have training later.

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,567
I won't eat now. I'll be off.

28
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,020
Wait.

29
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,940
Your parents passed away early.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,740
So I must

31
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,300
oversee your marriage.

32
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,660
I must

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,020
review your partner too. Got it?

34
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,660
Got it. You can rest assured.

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,620
When the time is right,

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,540
I'll definitely arrange for you to meet.

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,580
What do you mean by the right time?

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,140
Are you waiting until you have a child?

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,580
Then you'll inform me as a formality?

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,980
How is that possible?

41
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,580
Tell me.

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,458
She can't enter the family
if she doesn't pass your review.

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,494
Good that you understand.

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Rest assured. I know.
No need to say more.

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,300
Recently, I've been thinking

46
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,980
about visiting the old house in Sucheng.

47
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,992
Alright, I'll arrange
for someone to take you back.

48
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,700
You can go now.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,312
Is there really nothing else?

50
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,620
Go.

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Yes, Colonel.

52
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,700
Stardust Rogue?

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,700
(A red heart toward the sun: Hello!)

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,076
(Stardust Rogue: Hello.)

55
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,420
(Dear.)

56
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,860
Dear?

57
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,460
What's with the address?

58
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,300
(A red heart toward the sun:
Is what you sell here legitimate?)

59
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,140
(Stardust Rogue: Dear, rest assured.)

60
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,140
(Our products are strictly selected,)

61
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,860
(and we have proper authorization.)

62
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,540
(You can shop with confidence.)

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,540
It looks legitimate.

64
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,580
A red heart toward the sun?

65
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,940
Could this be the buyer's parents?

66
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,620
(Stardust Rogue:
Hello, this is a life tip.)

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,780
(Pajamas are a part of life)

68
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,380
(and also an attitude toward life.)

69
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,020
Love yourself and love your other half

70
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,580
is a kind of progress.

71
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,300
What nonsense is this?

72
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
A twisted argument, more like.

73
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,140
Stardust Rogue.

74
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,540
Scram.

75
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,040
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,140
(Babe.)

77
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,940
(I promised Su Qingche)

78
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,180
(to go to Sucheng
for self-defense training.)

79
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Go ahead.

80
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,647
I'm here at Polar Night with Qiancheng
to record some material.

81
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,300
Bye.

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,140
Quickly, take pictures.

83
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,840
(Han Xiaoli: Oh, youth!)

84
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,380
Qiancheng, come over quickly.

85
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,060
Come over quickly. Look.

86
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,180
Oh my god.

87
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,127
Quick, take pictures.

88
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,100
Lin Mu has a good figure too.

89
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,647
A bit inferior to Captain Su's.

90
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,712
What are you looking at? Let me see.

91
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,540
(Han Xiaoli: Oh, youth!)

92
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,140
Han Xiaoli is infatuated with these?

93
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,020
These are nothing.

94
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,905
You wouldn't understand.

95
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,060
Women appreciate disciplined men.

96
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,900
I have to let her broaden her horizons.

97
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,374
Are you recording material?

98
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,460
Yes.

99
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,220
Xie Yuan.

100
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,530
How about you join in?

101
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,940
I shouldn't.

102
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,860
Come on, join in.

103
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,780
I'll do it.

104
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,300
Are you okay?

105
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,260
Why am I not?

106
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,860
There's no sun indoors.

107
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,363
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

108
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,020
This

109
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,500
is called a man's armor.

110
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,860
I wore them here to give them to you.

111
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,660
Today, I'm going to show everyone

112
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,060
what Polar Night Team's combat pinnacle
looks like.

113
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,420
Take this.

114
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,960
- Well done.
- Well done.

115
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,860
How was it, Xiaoli?

116
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Not bad.

117
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,658
Are you crazy? There are so many people.

118
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,872
Are you giving up?

119
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,540
No.

120
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,820
Giving up?

121
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,780
Yes.

122
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,100
Come.

123
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,500
Thanks.

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,180
Did everyone see that?

125
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,620
From now on, combat training

126
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,100
will be at this intensity.

127
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,900
Now, let's talk

128
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,060
about the schedule
for tomorrow's activities.

129
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Qin will
handle tomorrow's reception work.

130
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,996
Make sure to register
when the students arrive.

131
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,980
This one here is Qiancheng.

132
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,060
He's in charge of our filming tomorrow

133
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,660
and the publicity work later on.

134
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,080
Ding Weiling.

135
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,700
You'll work with me tomorrow.

136
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,701
We'll demonstrate
women's self-defense techniques.

137
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,780
That's about it for today's work.

138
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,778
Everyone, dismiss.

139
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,780
I was quite hot just now, right?

140
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,940
It was okay.

141
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,410
At least much better
than when you first arrived.

142
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,260
Qiancheng, I'm quite photogenic, right?

143
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,247
The second-in-command is trying
to take over the first place, huh.

144
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,100
Captain Su is not here.

145
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,900
I have to maintain my image.

146
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,220
Garbage.

147
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,192
Is that pile of stuff...?

148
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:17,660
Oh my!

149
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,260
There are so many trophies over there.

150
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,060
It must be Su Qingche's, right?

151
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,740
You.

152
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:26,414
(Number One in Diving, Lu Qun)
Hurry up and wipe

153
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,649
your glasses clean to see clearly.

154
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,400
Lu Qun.

155
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,810
(Comrade Lu Qun,
Exemplary Vanguard in Earthquake Relief)

156
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,340
Lu Qun? Yours?

157
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,996
You really
can't judge a book by its cover.

158
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,220
What impression
did I leave on you before?

159
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,620
I must say

160
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,625
the lady from yesterday
left quite an impression.

161
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,140
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

162
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,260
Why don't you believe me? I...

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,780
(Nana)

164
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,620
(Nana)

165
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,580
Who is this?

166
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,980
Let me tell you.

167
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,660
Getting first place in diving
is especially difficult.

168
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,620
I was almost diving to 131 feet.

169
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,540
My nose was bleeding...

170
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,700
Your phone has been ringing.

171
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,960
Are you not going to answer it?

172
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,100
Really?

173
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,300
It is ringing indeed.

174
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,540
Who is it?

175
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,820
(Nana)

176
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,540
Real estate agent.

177
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,300
I wanted to buy a house a few days ago,

178
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
so they keep texting me.
They're diligent.

179
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,460
Don't mind them.

180
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:26,980
Lu!

181
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,665
Nana is looking for you.
She said you hung up her call.

182
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,900
(Lu, come visit us soon.)

183
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,420
(Look who I'm with.)

184
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:35,940
(Come.)

185
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,900
(Hello.)

186
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,560
- (Lu, come visit us.)
- (Come visit us.)

(Visit us soon.)

191
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,580
Zhou Yao, it's time to get off work.
Why haven't you left for dinner yet?

192
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,818
I'll go home to have dinner now.

193
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,472
That's also a real estate agent?

194
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,700
If I say she is, would you believe it?

195
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,980
What do you think?

196
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
What did I do?

197
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,300

- Captain Wu. Long time no see.

00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:29,330
(Polar Night Rescue)
Welcome.

201
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:30,741
This is my team member, Su Xingchen.

202
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,232
(Sucheng Rescue)
Xingchen, meet Captain Wu.

203
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:32,920
Nice to meet you.

204
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,700
Qingche, it's great you could come.

205
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,832
You even brought a strong foreign aid.

206
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,810
Our teams work closely.

207
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,940
Let's skip the formality.

208
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,920
Many have signed up today.

209
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,020
Most of them have arrived.

210
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,780
Get familiar with the venue first.

211
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,900
We'll start in half an hour.
How about that?

212
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,860
Sure, you go ahead.

213
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,723
We'll take a look around by ourselves.

214
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,380
Alright.

215
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,429
I juggle between customer service

216
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,934
and being your practice partner here.

217
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,820
Didn't he say it?

218
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,420
You're a strong foreign aid.

219
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,100

239
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,980

241
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,620

Me?

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,220
How did you know?

244
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,300
Did Lu Qun tell you?

245
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,380
(It doesn't matter how I know.)

246
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,043
If you're in Sucheng,
why aren't you visiting me?

247
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,614
You leave an old man like me here alone.

248
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:26,421
Is that right?

249
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,260
There are many relatives at home.

250
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,500
Can't they accompany you?

You must come back tonight.

256
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,460
But I'm really busy, Grandpa.

257
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,260
I'm warning you.

258
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,500
You can't come back empty-handed.

259
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
Bring Song Xingchen back too.

260
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,220
Wait. How do you know?

261
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,120
Your grandfather wants you back?

262
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,380

263

insisting that I go see him.

264
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,323
Lu Qun must have
given out my location again.

265
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:56,020
It's always him.

266
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,283
Grandpa also said...

267
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,420
Said what?

268
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,140
He knows you're here too,

269
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,458
so he wants to see you.

270
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,860
He wants to see me?

271
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,600
What do you think?

272
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,060
What can I think?

273
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,963
Are you scared?

274
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,900
Scared of what?

275
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,076
Have you
brought another woman home before?

276
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,980
No, this is the first time.

277
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,140
Well. Who knows.

278
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,100
Let's go.

279
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,900
Let's go.

Bro, make me look handsome later, okay?

281
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,180
Leave it to me.

282
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,300
Don't worry. Go ahead.

283
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,780

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,060
I called her, but she hasn't answered.

291
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,300
- It's okay. You go ahead.
- Okay.

293
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,100
Weiling, where are you?

294
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,780
(I'm stuck with something on my way.)

295
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,436
(There's a car accident on Yufeng Road.)

296
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,820
(A car overturned at the scene.)

297
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,180
(I'm participating in the rescue.)

298
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,390
Really? Do you need assistance?

299
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,510

300
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,300
(I can handle it here. It's just...)

301
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,180
It's okay.

302
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,700

Be careful and prioritize saving lives.

304
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,460
What happened?

305
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:34,290
Ding Weiling was supposed
to assist me for the on-site drill,

306
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,992
but due to an accident,
she can't make it.

307
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,900
Other members can't come too.

308
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,220
Some are occupied,

309
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,792
and some are dozens of kilometers away.

310
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,860
It's my negligence.

311
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,607
If Qingche had been in charge,

312
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,410
he would have
kept one or two as backups.

313
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:49,300
I just saw Qin. Can't she do it?

314
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,180
No, she can't. She hasn't learned it.

315
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,900
Besides, many came here

316
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,934

317
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:54,820
She has to guide them.

318
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,900
How about me?

319
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,660
You?

320
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,740
Can my figure handle it?

321
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,260
But you haven't learned it.

322
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,700
After the last drill,

323
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,220
I went back and practiced

324
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,300
a bit.

325
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,900
And during high school,

326
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,300
I was in the gymnastics team.

327
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,020
That's not enough.

328
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,254
It'll be embarrassing
if the teaching doesn't go well.

329
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,300
But you don't have any other choice now.

330
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,780
Who said they weren't nervous just now?

331
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,660
I'm not nervous.

332
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,300
Don't be nervous.

333
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,060
Every year around this time,

334
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,900
we would return
to the old house in Sucheng.

335
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,060
Old house?

336
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,460
With earth bricks
and a landscape garden?

337
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,540
You'll find out soon.

338
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,500
What's your grandfather like?

339
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,180
He's someone

340
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,540
who gives a stern first impression.

341
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,380
But he has a kind heart.

342
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,900
Let me tell you something.

343
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,220
Lu Qun used to be Grandpa's orderly.

344
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,020
He's a military retiree.

345
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,300
So, what should my identity be

346
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,780
when I go to your place later?

347
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,020
A friend or a colleague?

348
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Grandpa specifically
asked me to bring you back.

349
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,820
What do you think?

350
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,720
(Lu Qun)

351
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,340
I was just thinking about calling you.

352
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,083
You gave out my location again.

353
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:32,100
(You're carefree now,)

354
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,752
(returning to the old house in Sucheng.)

355
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,170
(I'm having a headache over here.)

356
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:35,898
(What happened?)

357
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,180
I...

358
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,860
Fortunately, an angel came to my aid.

359
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,749
(Otherwise, I would be in big trouble.)

360
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,054
(I'll tell you when you come back.)

361
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,100
I'm going to have a close combat

362
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,414
with Ms. Song's bestie later.

363
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,540
What did you say?

364
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,700
Hey, Ms. Song.

365
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,980
(It's nothing,)

366
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,700
(I was just making a metaphor.)

367
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,620
Nothing happened.

368
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,500
You can rest assured.

369
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,396
I'll hang up first.

370
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:06,100
Bye.

371
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,020
If your friend dares
to mess with my bestie,

372
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,880
you're in big trouble.

373
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,869
I'm responsible for that?

374
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:12,700
Of course, you are.

375
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,180
If your friend broke my bestie's heart,

376
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,660
you'll be held accountable.

377
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,060
Ma'am, you're right.
I'll keep a close eye on him.

378
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,780
You'd better be.

379
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,980
Hello, everyone.

380
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,260
Welcome to Polar Night Rescue.

381
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,780
Today's theme is
women's self-defense techniques.

382
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,860
Now, we'll learn our first move.

383
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,340
Imagine
someone grabbing your shoulder at night.

384
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,900
Bravo!

385
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,940
The key to this move

386
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,100
is that you must remember

387
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,340
to lower and rotate your body.

388
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,540
You need

389
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,580
to bring your arm to this position.

390
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,620
Don't let it go further in.

391
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,580
We're demonstrating.

392
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,596
You just do the move,
and I'll throw myself over.

393
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,180
Alright, now the second move.

394
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,700
If someone
grabs your neck like this, you...

395
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,820
Impressive. That's a real throw.

396
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,140
The key to this move is

397
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,140
to firmly grasp their thumbs.

398
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,900
A woman's strength

399
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
is never as strong as a man's.

400
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,740
Now, the third move.

401
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,940
If someone comes from behind

402
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,756
and wraps their arms
around your shoulder...

403
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,020

404
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,560
(Women's Self-Defense
Public Welfare Event)

405
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,060
Qingche, you're back.

406
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,620
Is Grandpa home, Ms. Zhang?

407
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,540
Yes, he's home.

408
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,260
He's been waiting for you.

409
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,980
This must be Ms. Song.

410
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,380
Hello, I'm Song Xingchen.

411
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,900
What a lovely young woman. Come on in.

412
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,900
Why are you staying still? Nervous?

413
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,498
You're thinking too much.

414
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,100
Mind the steps.

415
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,100
Take a look.

416
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:15,980
What's wrong?

417
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,180
I think my high heel got stuck.

418
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,500
Can you pull it out?

419
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,700
It's stuck tight.

420
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,540
Does it hurt?

421
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,540
Not really.

422
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,300
Why is it stuck so hard.

423
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,060
So this is the wild kitty
from Stardust Rouge,

424
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,740
the disloyal woman Qingyin described.

425
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,180
Song Xingchen.

426
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,580
Grandpa.

427
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,020
You are...

428
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,940
Grandpa, I'm Song Xingchen.

429
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,180
I see.

430
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,087
Grandpa, give us a moment.

431
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,345
I'll take her to change shoes.

432
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,500
Doesn't look like much of a wild kitty.

433
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,180
Just a little kitty.

434
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,740
Is it inappropriate to do that

435
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,258
in front of your grandfather just now?

436
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,923
Don't think too much about it.

437
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,340
Just be yourself,

438
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,460
like usual.

439
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,500
Relax a bit.

440
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,500
My grandfather likes

441
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,940
to grow flowers and plants.

442
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,860
He also keeps fish.

443
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Each fish has its own name.

444
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,410
This one is called...

445
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,780
Watch your words.

446
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,540
Don't badmouth me in front of outsiders.

447
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,420
Did I say anything bad?

448
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,458
Xingchen, you tell Grandpa what I said.

449
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,100
It's getting late now.

450
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,660
Is this young lady staying here?

451
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,220
Hurry up and tidy up the room.

452
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,060
I can tidy up the room

453
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,260
anytime later.

454
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,620
But if I let her stay here alone,

455
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,620
I might lose her.

456
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,100
You have

457
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,180
learned a lot from Lu Qun, haven't you?

458
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,820
You're eloquent now.

459
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,534
Didn't you ask me to learn from him?

460
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,820
You've become uncontrollable now.

461
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,860
Old Mr. Su, it's time for dinner.
It's getting late.

462
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,980
Let's eat.

463
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,378
Don't be fooled by his stern look.
He's actually kind.

464
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,900
Take a seat.

465
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,809
- Since you two are coming,
- Let me hang it for you.

466
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,338
we prepared such a big table of dishes,

467
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,620
but I can't eat half of them.

468
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,614
Sorry for the trouble, Old Mr. Su.

469
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,660
How old are you?

470
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,300
Twenty-nine.

471
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,420
Almost thirty.

472
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,420
Not yet.

473
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,860
But not young anymore.

474
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,940
Grandpa, Xingchen

475
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,420
is an exceptionally talented girl.

476
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,580
She's ambitious...

477
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,780
I didn't ask you, did I?

478
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,820
I come from a military background.

479
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,220
Our family is well-educated.

480
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,860
Qingche has always been

481
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,980
an outstanding student,

482
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,460
like exceptionally outstanding.

483
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,500
Career-wise,

484
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,690
he's doing quite well too.

485
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,940
To put it in trendy terms,

486
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,740
he has gained financial freedom.

487
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,860
Qingche is indeed outstanding.

488
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,500
Old Mr. Su, you've

489
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,620
raised an admirable grandson.

490
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,460
I come from a family of educators,
and I study medicine.

491
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,840
I plan to continue my studies,
so I start a business

492
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,945
to earn some tuition fees.

493
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,820
I see. A family of educators.

494
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,980
But judging from the way you dress,

495
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,100
I can't tell at all.

496
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,620
Nowadays,
young people prefers to dress freely.

497
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,580
You've seen quite a lot of the world.

498
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,887
I believe you wouldn't judge people
by their appearance.

499
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,100
I wonder what soup

500
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,716
did Ms. Zhang make today.

501
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,620
West Lake beef soup.

502
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,727
It's your favorite, Grandpa.

503
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:33,860
Let me get you some.

504
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,020
It smells so good.

505
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,283
These are all made
with seasonal vegetables.

506
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,180
What do you do now for work?

507
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,660
I'm a partner at Stardust Rouge now.

508
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,540
We mainly

509
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,420
sells women's supply,
lingerie, and sleepwear.

510
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,460
We also have some fashion items.

(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

512
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,020
How did the filming go today?

513
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,620
Don't worry. I'm a professional.

514
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,460
You performed brilliantly.

515
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,240
It's nothing. You've done well too.

516
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,820
Do you mind lending me a laptop?

517
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,860
I'll back up the footage.

518
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,980
Go get it from Zhou Yao downstairs.

519
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,380
I almost broke my bones for this shoot.

520
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,858
Make sure
to handle the photos well.

521
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,020
Sure. See you around.

522
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,660
Take care.

523
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,420
You worked hard today, Captain Lu.

524
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,380
Is everything okay?

525
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,940
Have you forgotten
you threw me many times today?

526
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,260
Didn't you say it was a demonstration?

527
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,980
Even so,
I still fell to the ground for real.

528
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,380
I'm made of flesh and blood too.

529
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,140
How about you help me
apply Red Flower Oil to ease the pain?

530
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,140
It's there.

531
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,060
Okay.

532
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,220
Thanks.

533
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,380
Um.

534
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,660
Where should I stick this?

535
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,220
No, rub some Red Flower Oil

536
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,860
where it's bruised first,

537
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
and then apply the patch.

538
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,260
I got it.

539
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,180
Do you know how to do this?

540
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,340
Rest assured.

541
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,300
Ouch, be gentle.

542
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,420
Are you trying to kill me?

543
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,780
It's a secret acupressure technique
Xingchen taught me.

544
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,020
After this,
I guarantee you to feel refreshed.

545
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,020
I wonder when my injuries will heal.

546
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
You told me to do it.

547
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,900
Are you trying to play the victim now

548
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,060
to ask for compensation?

549
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,420
As if I would do that.

550
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,860
Who knows.

551
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,100
What do I seem like to you?

552
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,460
A playboy? Or a rogue?

553
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,660
A playboy plus a rogue, I guess.

554
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,100
If we continue

555
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,180
to spend more time together,

556
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,500
I might get an additional label.

557
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,580
What label?

558
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,620
Incompetent.

559
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,340
Originally, I founded this rescue team.

560
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,300
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

561
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,820
But later I realized

562
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,340
I couldn't lead the team by myself.

563
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,860
So, I brought in Qingche.

564
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,820
During this time

565
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,780
when he led the team,

566
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,980
I got a strange feeling.

567
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,620
I felt

568
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,140
that if he were not around,

569
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,340
I mean if he were not in the team,

570
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,690
I would be able to handle it on my own.

571
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,260
But today…

572
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,340
What's wrong?

573
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,900
Is your spirit crushed?

574
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,980
Qingche and Dr. Song
went to Sucheng today.

575
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,340
I just realized

576
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,900
how difficult it is to lead everyone

577
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,300
to accomplish something.

578
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,340
Although the activity ended well,

579
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,180
the process was a mess.

580
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,580
If it weren't for your help today,

581
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,290
I wouldn't know how to wrap it up.

582
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,580
Forget promoting Polar Night
through this activity.

583
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,620
Its reputation almost took a hit.

584
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,260
Don't compare yourself to Captain Su.

585
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,970
Comparison game can be a real downer.

586
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,660
Sometimes,

587
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,340
I envy him.

588
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,700
Be careful.

589
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,420
Usually, when the second male lead

590
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,540
says that in a romance novel,

591
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,940
it foreshadows a dark transformation.

592
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,970
Have you watched too many dramas?

593
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,340
Qingche and I will always be united.

594
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,980
Always be united?

595
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,260
I bet you're the one

596
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,500
who spilled their itinerary
to Old Mr. Su.

597
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,900
It's just a brief mention.

598
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,780
No wonder.

599
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,050
I wondered why he was suddenly
called back to the old house.

600
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,140
It's okay. They'll have to face it

601
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,700
sooner or later in their relationship.

602
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,540
I completely

603
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,730
understand what you said just now.

604
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,220
What do you understand?

605
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,025
You're more capable than I am.

606
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,300
If it weren't for Xingchen,

607
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,660
my shop might have collapsed long ago.

608
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,520
When I consider it more closely,

609
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,900
I realize they do
have some unique qualities.

610
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,780
They have courage,

611
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,220
decisiveness,

612
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,940
clear thinking

613
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,450
and the determination to give their all
when faced with challenges.

614
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,260
You're more insightful

615
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
and summarize better than I do.

616
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,700
A soldier who doesn't want
to be a general isn't a good soldier.

617
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,940
Be grateful.

618
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,580
We have friends like them around us.

619
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,940
I didn't expect you,
besides watching cheesy romance dramas,

620
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,756
to also
enjoy female empowerment pep talks.

621
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,740
Bro, that's a quote from Napoleon.

622
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,300
Get some common sense, okay?

623
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,380
Well, it's normal for someone
who's a useless playboy rascal

624
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,820
to lack common sense.

625
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,380
Useless? Well, not necessarily.

626
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,540
As for being a rascal,

627
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,060
considering the heartfelt talk
you just had,

628
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,700
I think there's hope.

629
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:14,980
What about playboy?

630
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,700
That's a settled matter.

631
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,540
I think it's unlikely
to remove that label.

632
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,700
I'm good to go now. Let's go.

633
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,980
Okay. We're leaving.

634
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,580
Xiaoli.

635
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,220
Thanks a lot today.

636
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,570
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

637
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,620
Lu.

638
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,700
Qingyin?

639
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,060
This is for you.

640
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,460
For me?

641
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,100
I only brought a gift
for Qingche last time.

642
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,180
This time, it's for you.

643
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,860
Really?

644
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,020
I just went to the office
to find Qingche.

645
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,660
He's not there. Where is he?

646
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,265
Old Mr. Su called and asked him
to go back to our hometown.

647
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,110
He went back to our hometown?

648
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,140
Why didn't he invite me?

649
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,180
Qingyin, he's got company.

650
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,220
So don't meddle in it.

651
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,300
Someone is accompanying him? Who?

652
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Song Xingchen?

653
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,140
I didn't say that.

654
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,180
Perfect timing.

655
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,980
Let's see if you can
pass Grandpa's test.

656
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,260
You didn't say anything
to Old Mr. Su, did you?

657
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,340
No comment. I have to go.

658
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,100
Bye.

659
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,260
Qingyin, you…

660
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,540
Grandpa.

661
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Is this a mahogany chessboard?

662
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,420
You're an expert, right?

663
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,540
Do you know chess?

664
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,860
I know a little.

665
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,540
I can play a game with you, Grandpa.

666
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,700
Please.

667
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:21,940
Sure.

668
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,740
Are you sure you want
to play chess with him?

669
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,860
Don't worry. I won't embarrass you.

670
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,220
No, it's not… Okay, go ahead.

671
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,180
You'll see.

672
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,420
Grandpa, you go first.

673
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,620
Black first, then white. Ladies first.

674
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,660
Okay.

675
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
(Wait up.)

676
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,540
(Listen to me, okay?)

677
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,660
(Let go of me!)

678
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,116
(We've been together for so long.)

679
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,180
(Why don't you trust me?)

680
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,858
(But now that this has happened,)

681
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,170
(how do you expect me to trust you?)

682
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,230
(Please stop making a scene.)

683
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:24,340
(Come on.)

684
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,940
(I can't take it anymore.)

685
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,540
(He just happens to like both)

686
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,860
(of us at the same time.)

687
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,959
(It's not a big deal.)

688
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,421
- Xiaoli, I bought this for you.
- Why are you making a fuss?

689
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,300
- No, it's still warm.
- Leave.

690
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,100
Leave right now.

691
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,740
If you don't, I'll make you.

692
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,340
Lu Qun?

693
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,500
What are you doing?

694
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:46,940
I…

695
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,900
(Please, you're my little sister.)

696
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,220
Why are you here?

697
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,300
Well, I got you some snacks on my way.

698
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,460
I thought you might be hungry.

699
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,516
We live on opposite sides of the city.

700
00:38:02,523 --> 00:38:03,665
How is it "on your way"?

701
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,300
Tell me. What are you really up to?

702
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,300
I just wanted to say,

703
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,283
can we keep our conversations
in the training room

704
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,374
during the day to ourselves,

705
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,830
especially with Song Xingchen?

706
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,500
I don't blabber that much, okay?

707
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,240
Don't worry.
I know you care about your reputation.

708
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,420
That's good.

709
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,220
Have a seat.

710
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,060
Okay.

711
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,260
Does it still hurt?

712
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,060
No. This steel body can handle anything.

713
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,734
Not hurt at all.

714
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,700
Can Song Xingchen play chess, too?

715
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,820
Of course.

716
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,380
She's a National Go
Second-level Athlete.

717
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,820
When she got into high school
with special privileges…

718
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,460
Really?

719
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,860
What is she doing?

720
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,178
She's playing chess with Old Mr. Su.

721
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,220
She's acting on impulse again.

722
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,420
This might offend Old Mr. Su.

723
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,700
How could it be?

724
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,363
Old Mr. Su enjoys
having a chess partner.

725
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:23,180
It's a plus.

726
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,340
You probably don't know.

727
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,060
Song Xingchen's all in
when it comes to Go,

728
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,540
regardless of family connections.

729
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,820
Put it here.

730
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,700
Here.

731
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
No.

732
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,100
Wait. My eyes

733
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,060
are a bit blurry.

734
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,287
Grandpa, you should
make your move without regrets.

735
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,520
You're a veteran revolutionary.

736
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,672
You should keep your word.

737
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,660
What does "regret" mean?

738
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,260
I'm just trying different moves.

739
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,570
(To win Old Mr. Su's favor,
take it easy on the chess game.)

740
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,220
It's your turn.

741
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,720
I'll take this piece.

742
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,020
Okay.

743
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,380
It's a dead end.

744
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,780
Take three.

745
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,540
Grandpa, I lost.

746
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,780
Next time, go easy on me
with a few extra pieces,

747
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,300
or else you're bullying the youngsters.

748
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,940
Be confident.

749
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,860
With effort,
there's still room for victory.

750
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,500
When I watch others play chess,

751
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,180
they can only look three moves ahead.

752
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,660
But you see the whole board.

753
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,260
I truly admire your skill.

754
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,980
Of course.

755
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,260
Grandpa, I need to go out for a second.

756
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,460
Who am I?

757
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,220
I led soldiers into battle.

758
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,780
If I don't see the whole board,

759
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,563
can I deploy troops
and set up formations?

760
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,060
Exactly.

761
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,300
Your level is consistently stable.

762
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,510
Xingchen went so easy on you.
Wasn't winning this chess game a breeze?

763
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,660
Do you have the right to speak?

764
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,580
You don't even know how to play Gomoku.

765
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,060
What are you even saying?

766
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,340
But this young lady's chess skills

767
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,420
are not bad.
