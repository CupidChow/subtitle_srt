=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 1=

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,280
(Purple Flavour)

25
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,300
As a doctor, Song Xingchen

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,980
dresses like a female star every day.

27
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,900
Right. The hospital's performance
requirements are so strict.

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,580
She ranks last every quarter.

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,700
If everyone
in our hospital is like this,

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,980
not wanting to make money,

31
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,900
we'll have to live on air together.

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,980
She relies on being good-looking.

33
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,060
I guess she got promoted
to attending doctor due to her looks.

34
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,980
Those who know, know.

35
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,580
Sorry.

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,380
I'm late.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,970
Congratulations, Xingchen.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,710
Today, we're here to celebrate your promotion
to attending doctor.

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,180
Come, let's
congratulate Xingchen together.

40
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,300
Mr. Zhang always takes care of you.

41
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,460
Shouldn't you have a drink with him?

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
Everyone.

43
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,540
Thank you for coming today.

44
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,100
Also, thanks to Mr. Zhang
for nurturing me over the years.

45
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,980
I'll toast to everyone.

46
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,620
Let's raise our glasses.

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,200
Congratulations to Xingchen's promotion
to attending doctor.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,060
Cheers.

49
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,940
- Congratulations, Xingchen.
- Congratulations.

50
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,020
Today's gathering
is not a promotion banquet.

51
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,740
It's a farewell dinner.

52
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,180
I've resigned.

53
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,340
Resigned?

54
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
Why did you resign?

55
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,280
Between professionalism and performance,

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,010
I think professionalism
is more important.

57
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,100
Of course.

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,940
Thank you for taking care of me
over the years.

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,580
Goodbye, everyone.

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,740
(My name is Song Xingchen.
29 years old this year.)

61
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,260
(Originally, I was)

62
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,100
(a sensible and excellent child.)

63
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,140
(I obediently
met my family's expectations)

64
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,420
(and got into medical school.)

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,720
(I did my residency
and went through the standard training.)

66
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,740
(With the recommendation of my mentor,)

67
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,580
(I started working
at a private hospital.)

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,260
(Following the normal trajectory,)

69
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,010
(I'd apply for a professional title)

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,940
(and become a renowned doctor.)

71
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,460
(But now,)

72
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,100
(everything has changed.)

73
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,860
Here.

74
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,000
Have you really thought it through?

75
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,540
Of course. Otherwise?

76
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,860
You've planned this for a long time,
Song Xingchen.

77
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,100
Well done.

78
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,220
Of course, it's not that simple.

79
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,380
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

80
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
But this is also good.

81
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,100
Anyway,

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,220
I couldn't stand it long ago.

83
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,900
For the sake of surgery,

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,460
you not only need to focus on academics

85
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,820
but also take shifts regularly
to care for patients.

86
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,900
There are times when you don't sleep

87
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,460
for two days and nights.

88
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,740
Doctors are all like this.

89
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,500
That's not something to complain about.

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,820
But...

91
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,340
I joined this hospital
after I graduated.

92
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,300
I still have some feelings for it.

93
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,220
But people have to aim higher.

94
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,880
I still have to go for further training.

95
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,100
You're already preparing
for further training now.

96
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,570
How about joining me
in starting a business?

97
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,340
Me?

98
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,780
A women's supply store?

99
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,140
What's wrong with that?

100
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,900
Okay.

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,300
For the happy lives of the ladies,

102
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm willing to put in all my effort.

103
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,260
Let's go. Let's welcome

104
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,820
the upcoming 30s together.

105
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,140
Cheers.

(Haicheng City Go Tournament.

108
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,180
You're already preparing
for further training now.

109
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,970
How about joining me
in starting a business?

110
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,460
I'll treat you to some meat.

111
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,060
(Oh no.)

112
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,140

to help her with the store.)

(Recipient:)

116
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,060
Thanks.

117
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,780
You're welcome.

118
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,620
(Why are they almost expired?)

119
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,560
(Stardust Rouge)

120
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,220
(Stardust Rouge)

121
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,820
(Stardust Rouge)
Hello?

122
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,220
Why did you
send me a bunch of old stock?

123
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,940
It's a month away from expiration.

124
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,150
(How can you get this price
if it's not old stock?)

125
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,060
(They're not expired
and are authentic, right?)

126
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,180
That's true.

127
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,980
But I can't sell them at all.

128
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,850
Who would buy a bunch
of almost expired things

129
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,820
and keep them at home?

130
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,860
(We only handle delivery, not sales.)

131
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,760
(You have to solve it yourself.)

132
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,740
How can you...

133
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,700
Hello?

134
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,380
Xingchen, you're here.

135
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,100
Come in and sit.

136
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,820
About what you told me yesterday...

137
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,020
I had too much to drink yesterday.

138
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,020
Don't take it to heart.

139
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,500
We agreed to eat meat together.

140
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,420
I can't.

141
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,180
Xingchen.

142
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,360
There's a problem
with this batch of goods I bought.

143
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,740
I heard about it.

144
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,500
This is a good opportunity.

145
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,660
How is this an opportunity?

146
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,820
It's a big pit.

147
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,420
I can jump in by myself,

148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,940
but I can't drag you in with me.

149
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,620
Crisis is an opportunity.

150
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,380
If you let me invest at a low price now,

151
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,820
it's a good deal for me.

152
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,450
I estimate the value of your shop
to be 300 thousand.

153
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,340
I'll contribute 150 thousand and myself.

154
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,940
If we make a profit, we split it 50-50.

155
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,020
Isn't that a good deal?

156
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,580
I know you mean well,

157
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,460
but

158
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,410
it's really troublesome this time.

159
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,210
I really don't want
to drag you into this.

160
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,300
Look at me.

161
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,900
Don't worry.

162
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,460
Even if it's a big pit,

163
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,740
we can level it.

164
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,300
Ms. Han, look forward working with you.

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,420
What are you hesitating for?

166
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,380
You may lack confidence in yourself,

167
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,700
but don't forget who I am.

168
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,860
When things are tough,

169
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,940
Song Xingchen
will overcome all obstacles.

170
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,980
Alright.

171
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,700
We need to sell this batch of goods

172
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
within two months.

173
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,860
Since it's called "Stardust Rouge",

174
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,700
we need to get on the go.

175
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,780
(Beilun District
Binhai New City Hospital)

176
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,220
On ultrasound, there's nothing wrong.

177
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,700
But the child in the belly

178
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,700
changes every day.

179
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,620
We can't do the check every day, right?

180
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,780
I wanted

181
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,740
(Office of the director)
to do a comprehensive examination again.

182
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,780
(Office of the director)

183
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
(Office of the director)
Money is a small matter.

184
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,660
(Office of the director)
Mainly, we want to buy peace of mind.

185
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,300
Our hospital
just updated its equipment last month.

186
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,220
I think it's especially suitable
for families like yours.

187
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,900
It seems like Song Xingchen
doesn't want to work anymore.

188
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,540
Exactly.

189
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,760
Everyone in our department
knows the performance metrics.

190
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,020
But she pretends not to know.

191
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,800
She doesn't want to do this and that.

192
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,260
She ranks last in the metrics
every quarter.

193
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,620
She's the best at pretending.

194
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,860
Really.

195
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,110
I admit I'm not as good as you all
in terms of quota.

196
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,980
I'm just decent in my specialty.

197
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,220
(Welcome to Block No. 11 Fashion Street)

198
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,940
(Welcome to Block No. 11 Fashion Street)
Look. What's that?

199
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,820
(Welcome to Block No. 11 Fashion Street)

200
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,500
(Welcome to Block No. 11 Fashion Street)
It's a puppy.

201
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,980
Isn't that dangerous?

202
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,540
Hey, kid, what's going on?

203
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,260
A little dog climbed up there.

204
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,740
What should we do, Miss?

205
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,380
What's happening?

206
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,620
Sir.

207
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,860
Is there a tenant on the third floor?

208
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,260
We should go up now to save the dog.

209
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,060
Third floor, right?

210
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,820
No one here.
They've all gone abroad.

211
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,310
The door is locked. You can't get in.

212
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,700
I'll call for rescue.

213
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,700
Don't worry.

214
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,860
Be careful!

215
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,620
Be careful!

216
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,940
Be careful.

217
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,340
Be careful.

218
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,780
Impressive. I feel scared just watching.

219
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,020
Be careful.

220
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,140
Come over here.

221
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,940
Here.

222
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,740
Come here.

223
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,260
Come here.

224
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:44,900
Come on.

225
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,580
Be careful!

226
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,700
Quick. Let's help

227
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,420
to catch it.

228
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,100
Here it comes.

229
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,940
How about that man?

230
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,740
Hey, what's up?

231
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,940
(Don't forget today is your duty day.)

232
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,540
Got it.

233
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,260
I'll be there soon.

234
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,060
Here. Hold it.

235
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,100
It's fine.

236
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,460
It's just its front leg

237
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,260
is twisted.

238
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,460
Take good care of it.

239
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,940
Be more careful.

240
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,580
Don't leave the dog
in a dangerous place.

241
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,500
Understood.

242
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,940
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thank you, Miss.

243
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

244
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,260
We're here

245
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,700
to announce something important.

246
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,380
Let's welcome the new captain

247
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,380
of Polar Night Rescue,

248
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,980
Su Qingche, Captain Su.

249
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,020
Hello, everyone. Su Qingche here.

250
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,060
Let me introduce Captain Su first.

251
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,980
Captain Su graduated
from the International Security Academy,

252
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,140
the most authoritative institution

253
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,100
in the field
of counter-terrorism worldwide.

254
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,100
Captain Su has also served
in international rescue missions

255
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,900
and worked as an instructor
at the Lorburg Counter-Terrorism School.

256
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,220
As you all know,

257
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,140
Polar Night Rescue

258
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,060
is a purely voluntary team.

259
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,180
We don't get paid.

260
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,780
As part

261
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,540
of the government's rescue force,

262
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,860
we have to go
into the heart of disasters.

263
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,140
Now, I take on the role of captain.

264
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,020
It won't be much different

265
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,100
from Captain Lu.

266
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,940
I just hope

267
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,540
to strengthen

268
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,180
and expand our grassroots rescue force,

269
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,380
help more people,

270
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,260
and establish Polar Night Rescue

271
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,350
as a prominent rescue brand.

272
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Let's welcome Captain Su.

273
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,900
Xingchen.

274
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,980
How come you have time
to come home for dinner?

275
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
Is your work not busy?

276
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,060
Yeah, it's not busy.

277
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,900
Private hospitals
are different from public ones.

278
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,260
They have specific quota
and are very busy.

279
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,740
How come you have some free time now?

280
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,620
I had been working overtime before,

281
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,220
so it's my turn to take a break now.

282
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,900
A while ago,
a few old friends and I had a gathering.

283
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,740
You won't believe it.

284
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,100
Someone knows Mr. Zhang
from your department.

285
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,740
How is he like?

286
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,220
He's fine.

287
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,380
Good.

288
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,740
How about this?

289
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,020
Let's arrange a meal
with Mr. Zhang some day.

290
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,780
Dad, can you two stop meddling

291
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,340
in my work?

292
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,820
Okay, we won't meddle in your work.

293
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,220
But for other things,

294
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,740
you have to let us handle them.

295
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,780
We have...

296
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,100
arranged a blind date for you.

297
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,020
(Su Qingche)
arranged a blind date for you.

298
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,540
I won't go on a blind date.

299
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,220
Do you even know what type I like?

300
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,620
You even have a type?

301
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,380
I like handsome ones.

302
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,740
What's the use of handsome guys?

303
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,260
I mean handsome as in...

304
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,420
Forget it. You won't understand.

305
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,180
I've seen this information.

306
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,340
This young man has a good background.

307
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,300
Look. He is excellent.

308
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,460
Are you going or not?

309
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,680
Alright,
let's arrange a meal with Mr. Zhang

310
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,300
and talk about your career.

311
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,500
Shall I call him now?

312
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,620
I'll go.

313
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,860
I'll have to eat more now

314
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,300
in case I lose my appetite tomorrow.

315
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,120
(The Most Outstanding Volunteer
in Haicheng City: Lu Qun)

316
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,940
Come on. Get up. Let's continue.

317
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,180
I'm done.

318
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,100
You're crazy.

319
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,300
No more?

320
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,220
Yeah.

321
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,820
Really? Is it that tiring?

322
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,340
No one confronts their buddy
so aggressively.

323
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,460
You didn't practice enough
and have regressed.

324
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,020
The firefighting equipment here
is insufficient.

325
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,620
The equipment
should be inspected every six months.

326
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,180
Dude.

327
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,940
We're just a charity.

328
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,360
We don't have money to get those things.

329
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,420
Is it a money problem?

330
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,500
It's a safety awareness problem.

331
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,500
Alright.

332
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,540
Dude, you just took office today,
and you're nagging at me.

333
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,100
Are you a robot?

334
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,660
What's the use
of constantly training me anyway?

335
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,860
Tonight, when you go home,

336
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,020
pick a handsome outfit.

337
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,020
Get ready for your blind date tomorrow.

338
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,300
How do you know about the date?

339
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,140
Well.

340
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,860
Grandpa is concerned about you.

341
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,620
Being his only grandson,

342
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,860
you're never at home.

343
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,660
Of course, he wants

344
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,900
to find a woman to tie you down at home.

345
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,540
I wonder what Grandpa does to bribe you.

346
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,260
That's not cool.

347
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,500
Don't say that about Grandpa.

348
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,580
He didn't bribe me at all.

349
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,980
Anyway,

350
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,540
Grandpa asked me

351
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,300
to send your resume to the matchmaker,

352
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,780
including your assets,

353
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,020
your most handsome photo,

354
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,260
and your home address.

355
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,260
Most importantly,

356
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,660
I wrote your resume, so good luck.

00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,140
Hey.

359
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,820
How did it go, babe?
Have you confessed today?

360
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,020
(Not yet.)

361
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,380
My mom wants me
to pick between spilling the resignation

362
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,660
or going on a blind date.

363
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,060
I picked the blind date.

364
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,580
How's the guy
your mom found for you this time?

365
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,460
Can he meet your approval?

366
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,680
(How long
since you were in a relationship?)

367
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,380
(Before, you didn't have time.)

368
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,460
(This time,)

369
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,140
I think you should find a suitable one

370
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,880
and give it a try.

371
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,300
If I can find one,

372
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,980
why do I need a blind date?

373
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,220
Besides,

374
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,420
my focus now is to manage the store
and pursue further studies.

375
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,060
Even if I really want to date,

376
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,940
what I expect is a mutual

377
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,500
and balanced love.

378
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,180
That's right.

379
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,700
The so-called blind date

380
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,780
is to let a group of people

381
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,650
who are least skilled
in wooing the opposite sex

382
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,380
try their luck
with the most challenging catches.

383
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,220
Ms. Song, be careful.

384
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,780
No, it's this man who should be careful.

385
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,660
I'm going to mess it up.

386
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,060
What are you planning to do?

387
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,300
First, deliberately be late.

388
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,100
Second, wear revealing clothes.

389
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,660
Third, argue about everything.

390
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,300
No man

391
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,140
can endure this three-pronged attack.

392
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,580
I wish you success then, Ms. Song.

393
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,140
(I'll be waiting for you at the store.)

394
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,740
Okay. Miss you.

395
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,780
(Bye.)

396
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,580
Bye.

397
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
(Restaurant No. 1 Building)

398
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,860
(Su Qingche)

399
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,500
(I deliberately
dressed like this today.)

400
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,460
(It should be enough to scare him away.)

401
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,820
(Su Qingche)

402
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,460
You're Su Qingche, right?

403
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,980
Ms. Song?

404
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,380
That's me.

405
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,510
Nice to meet you.

406
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,820
(It's her.)

407
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,620
Take a seat.

408
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,380
Ms. Song.

409
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,140
You're 15 minutes late.

410
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,820
I didn't even notice.

411
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,820
Why come on a blind date?

412
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
Family requirements.

413
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,820
That makes two of us.

414
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,660
(Su Qingche)

415
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,580
(Su Qingche)
Based on the profile here,

416
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,260
you're a firefighter?

417
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,470
Not a government official.

418
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,780
And you are...

419
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,620
A doctor?

420
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,020
Not anymore.

421
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,140
What do you mean?

422
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,860
I'm not a doctor anymore.

423
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,620
My current identity

424
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,140
is the manager
of a women's supply store.

425
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,280
(Stardust Rogue)

426
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,340
What did you say?

427
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,180
You heard me.

428
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,580
You should update your profile.

429
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,100
I see your profile
isn't very reliable either.

430
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,260
International Security Academy

431
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,300
and Counter-Terrorism School's
instructor.

432
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,460
Are you a counter-terrorism enthusiast?

433
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,620
Ms. Song,
are you questioning my profession?

434
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,500
Probably only naive girls

435
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,300
will believe in your crafted image.

436
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,540
You're acting quite well.

437
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,580
Looks about 30% convincing.

438
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,980
Ms. Song, you have high standards.

439
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,220
Alright, let's get to the process.

440
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,580
If you don't mind,

441
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,060
report your height, weight,

442
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,900
salary, savings,
and family relationships.

443
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,100
Sir.

444
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,300
Isn't it a bit impolite
to look at people like this?

445
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,100
Sorry.

446
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,220
I was just thinking,

447
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,540
have we met somewhere before?

448
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,820
Do you think this tactic works on me?

449
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,900
Let's get to the point.

450
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,700
Sorry.

451
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,900
I don't want to answer those questions
you asked earlier.

452
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,620
Then, Mr. Su,

453
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,340
is there anything you can reveal?

454
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,460
House?

455
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,180
Car?

456
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,380
Exes?

457
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
It's all in the profile.

458
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,880
How can I tell if it's exaggerated
just by looking at the profile?

459
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,460
Speaking of profiles,

460
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,900
your profile

461
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,060
has a big gap.

462
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,440
It's not favorable for your blind date.

463
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,700
What gap?

464
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,940
(Song Xingchen)
Is it you in this photo?

465
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,660
Of course, it's me.

466
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,220
(Song Xingchen)
It's an exact match.

467
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,620
Any objections?

468
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
No objections.

469
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,940
Just a friendly reminder.

470
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,860
It says in your profile

471
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,140
that you have no dating experience.

472
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,210
Have you been single since childhood?

473
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,820
Why act innocent?

474
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,380
It seems you have

475
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,220
a high opinion of my profile.

476
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,780
That's not the case.

477
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,860
I just feel like you go for wool
and come home shorn.

478
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,700
You're not very emotionally intelligent.

479
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,460
You're quite good at talking.

480
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,580
So sharp-tongued.

481
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,580
You're not too shabby yourself, Mr. Su.

482
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,580
(Gentle personality, pure and lovely,
a wife material?)

483
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,780
(Successful career, refined gentleman,
handsome appearance?)

484
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,020
(- Unreliable.
- Unreliable.)

485
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,900
In that case,

486
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,380
I won't accompany you any longer.

487
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,740
You should hurry to the next date.

488
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,620
Next date? What next date?

489
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,660
You have another one?

490
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,780
Do you really not know,
or are you pretending?

491
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,080
(Stardust Rogue)

492
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,700
Unbelievable.

493
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,800
(Stardust Rogue)

494
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,980
(Grandpa: I want to eat durian.)

495
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,500
(Stardust Rogue)

496
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,540
(No, I placed the order
just for the free gift.)

497
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,300
(Now you tell me that you don't have it.
Bad review.)

498
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,020
I'm back.

499
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,900
Hey.

500
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,300
How was your blind date?

501
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,020
He looks okay.

502
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,940
But we only met for about 15 minutes.

503
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,340
And we argued from start to finish.

504
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,740
Did he win?

505
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,860
Of course not.

506
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,700
But I achieved my goal.

507
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,580
I just wanted to make him back off.

508
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,980
No further follow-up.

509
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,400
What's wrong with you?

510
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,620
Babe, let me tell you.

511
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,340
Our store's flawless record

512
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,140
was just shattered a moment ago.

513
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
What happened?

514
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,380
This afternoon, there was a customer.

515
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,740
When delivering the item to her,

516
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,340
the delivery man was half an hour late,

517
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,060
and the free gift was missing.

518
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,780
I begged and pleaded.

519
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,100
My lips are almost worn out.

520
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,490
She said our "Deliver what's promised"
is false advertising

521
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,040
and insisted on giving us a bad review.

522
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,900
This is like a beauty
having a mole on her face.

523
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,380
Is there anything we can do
to salvage this?

524
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,340
Our previous gifts

525
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,260
were all given out.

526
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,580
I asked her
if we could give her other gifts,

527
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,340
but she refused.

528
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,600
She insisted on the previous one.

529
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,220
She even said

530
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,690
that if we don't give her
the previous gift,

531
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,140
she'll add another complaint.

532
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,380
Alright, I got it.

533
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,720
I'll go to the supermarket
right away and send it to her.

534
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,620
You quickly tell her

535
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,380
that we'll send her
triple the gifts as compensation,

536
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,820
and she must cancel the bad review.

537
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,580
Wait a moment.

538
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,210
The supermarket ones are expensive.

539
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,420
Isn't this a loss-making business?

540
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,380
Babe.

541
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,940
A good start is half the battle.

542
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,540
We can't die at the starting line.

543
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,180
I'm going now.

544
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,300
Excuse me.

545
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,620
Is there still stock of this?

546
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,420
You can check over there.

547
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,260
Okay, thank you.

548
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,900
You have a girlfriend
and went on blind dates?

549
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,580
Don't that something Security Academy

550
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,740
teaches moral education?

551
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,380
International Security Academy.

552
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,200
It's about the same.

553
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,940
A small suggestion.

554
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,660
This one works better.

555
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,300
Is she a twin?

556
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,060
Grandpa.

557
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,340
Grandpa.

558
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,860
I bought durian for you.

559
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,820
How was it?

560
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,100
How was what?

561
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,020
What how was what?

562
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,420
Where did you go?

563
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,580
Oh, the blind date.

564
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,460
Not for me.

565
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,860
How so?

566
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,460
Is there a big difference
between the person and the photo?

567
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,740
Is she not good-looking?

568
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,420
Or is her height not suitable?

569
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,710
It has nothing to do with those.

570
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,740
Then it's the personality.

571
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,620
Were you stingy with your words

572
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
and made the atmosphere awkward,

573
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,340
scaring her away?

574
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,340
I didn't.

575
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,620
What do you mean you didn't?

576
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,180
You sure did.

577
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,420
You, being a vigorous young man,

578
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,940
why aren't you
showing any insight in this aspect?

579
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,540
You always hang out with those men.

580
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,260
What kind of success can you achieve?

581
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,940
I came back, didn't I?

582
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,010
Didn't I return to the country?

583
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,980
Since you're back,
don't go anywhere else.

584
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,900
Just work well in the rescue team.

585
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,780
Learn from Lu Qun.

586
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,620
See how he interacts with girls.

587
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,580
In this aspect, he's strong.

588
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,540
Grandpa, are you joking?

589
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,260
Lu Qun doesn't even choose
when looking for a girlfriend.

590
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,140
Shouldn't one look for a girlfriend

591
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,620
whose values align with their own?

592
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,700
Oh my.

593
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,740
You're this old,

594
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,980
and you've never been in love.

595
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,260
Now you're talking about values?

596
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,020
Don't use that to hoodwink me.

597
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,380
I still think

598
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,100
that building a career first
before starting a family is good.

599
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,180
Here we go again.

600
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,740
What does "building a career first
before starting a family" mean?

601
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,800
Or is it "starting a family first
and then building a career"?

602
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,300
Both are nonsense.

603
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,260
At each stage of life,

604
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,140
you have to do things suitable
for that stage.

605
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,660
If you date when you're in high school,

606
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,380
that's early dating.

607
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,180
If you're at your age,

608
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,900
and you still don't have a girlfriend,

609
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,700
you must have a problem.

610
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,820
I'm talking about something serious.

611
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,180
Are you ignoring me?

612
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,340
Get up. Stand up.

613
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,100
Wait. Is militarized management

614
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,460
still necessary for my age?

615
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,540
Doesn't what I say matter?

616
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,500
It does.

617
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,660
Alright, spill it. What's going on?

618
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,500
Report.

619
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,740
I did try to get along well,

620
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,060
but the difference

621
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,900
between our working domains
is too large.

622
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,060
I don't think we will have any

623
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,100
common language.

624
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,780
Didn't the matchmaker say

625
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,140
she graduated from medical school

626
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,280
and has a corresponding job?

627
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,140
As for you, you're in the rescue team.

628
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,420
One rescues the dying
while the other assists the injured.

629
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,820
Isn't that a good match?

630
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,740
How is she not for you?

631
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,300
She told me herself

632
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,700
that she's no longer a doctor

633
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,420
and is now selling lingerie.

634
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,780
Selling lingerie...

635
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,900
She runs a women's supply store?

636
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,540
Yes.

637
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,140
But...

638
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,220
Wait. Even if she gave up

639
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,540
on becoming a doctor,

640
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,580
she could have opened a pet shop

641
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,900
and become a vet for pets.

642
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,060
That would have matched her.

643
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,740
Exactly.

644
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,340
Alright.

645
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,780
Let's forget about this.

646
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,880
Since you think it's inappropriate,
then so be it.

647
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,700
By the way,

648
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,060
I'm planning

649
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,060
to visit my old comrade recently

650
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,660
and might not be home for a few days.

651
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,300
So, tonight,

652
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,100
why don't we have something to drink?

653
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:29,860
Sure.

654
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,580
I'll whip up some side dishes.

655
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,820
Great. Come on.

656
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,740
Let's go.

657
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,140
It's fine if he's not interested.

658
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Why did you
say my daughter's conduct is an issue?

659
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,660
(Well, why did your daughter
open that kind of shop?)

660
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,200
(Don't you feel embarrassed about it?)

661
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,300
(That guy is young and successful.)

662
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,620
(Your daughter is almost thirty)

663
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,260
(and will be too old
if she doesn't marry soon.)

664
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,060
(Do you understand?)

665
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,980
(Get her to find a decent job.)

666
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,820
You better explain it to me clearly.

667
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,140
What indecent thing
is my daughter doing?

668
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,980
(I'm even embarrassed to say it.)

669
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,940
(How did you educate your daughter?)

670
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,340
(If this continues,)

671
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,040
(I won't introduce anyone else to you.)

672
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,820
Give it to me.

673
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,980
Please inform Su Qingche

674
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,930
that before
accusing someone of misconduct,

675
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,900
he should
examine his own moral character.

676
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,580
Why is he blind dating
when he's not single?

677
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Is he a rascal?

678
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,180
How dare he look down on my profession?

679
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,700
How shameless and hypocritical.

680
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,980
If you say I'm too old,

681
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,740
then what is he?

682
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,100
A rotten cabbage no one wants?

683
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,860
Chen.

684
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,540
Did you say your blind date

685
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,620
already has a girlfriend?

686
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,340
Mom.

687
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,180
Since you have the money,
use it to buy skincare products.

688
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,860
Can you stop wasting your money

689
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,100
on blind dating websites?

690
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Also, about my photo.

691
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,180
Can you not use

692
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,100
my 18-year-old photo?

693
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,740
You look pretty in it.

694
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,740
Stop.

695
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,180
I feel something's not right.

696
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,980
He said

697
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,620
that you have an indecent job.

698
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,940
What does that mean?

699
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,380
That's right.
What does that mean? Explain.

700
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,860
I resigned.

701
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,220
- What?
- What?

702
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,860
No wonder you kept refusing when asked

703
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,940
to meet your superiors.

704
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,580
Turns out you've already resigned.

705
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,980
If you've resigned,

706
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,580
what's your current job?

707
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,460
I opened a store with Xiaoli.

708
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,420
What store?

709
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,420
A women's supply store.

710
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,860
- What?
- What?

711
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,100
You.

712
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
Song Xingchen, you've gone too far.

713
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,940
You should have some limits
when helping your friend.

714
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,340
You can invest in her store,

715
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,980
but how could you give up

716
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,300
such a good job?

717
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,260
You're just having wild fantasies.

718
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
You haven't experienced
the harsh realities of society.

719
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,180
Old man, quick.

720
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,500
Go and find your ex-colleague

721
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,380
and get her back to work.
Get her job back.

722
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:39,980
Wait.

723
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,380
What's wrong with me
opening a small business?

724
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,580
Moreover, I'm only
helping Xiaoli with her store.

725
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,850
Once she gets through this phase,

726
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,460
I'll continue my studies.

727
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,340
A small business?

728
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,900
You gave up being a doctor
for a crooked job.

729
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,900
I can't even say that I'm your mother

730
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,220
because it's so embarrassing.

731
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,700
Dad.

732
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,820
Ma'am.

733
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,460
Calm down.

734
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,460
The child

735
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,980
has her own life plans.

736
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,540
That's very natural.

737
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,460
Let's support her, okay?

738
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,380
Chen, go on with your matters.

739
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,500
Remember to come home often.

740
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,700
I'll make you soup.

741
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,340
Thank you, Dad.

742
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Song Xingchen.

743
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Come back here!

744
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,260
Ma'am.

745
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,900
Calm down.

746
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,380
Calm down.

747
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,020
Am I still your boss?

748
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,680
Of course.
You're the boss of this family.

749
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,970
Yet you always flatter your daughter.

750
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,860
I wouldn't dare.

751
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,770
Over the years,
she had been such a good child,

752
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,300
but now she's turned into this.

753
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,900
Nothing about her seems right,

754
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,500
and it's because of your indulgence.

755
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,740
Wait.

756
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,580
Ma'am, listen to me.

757
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,500
Let's just consider this
as her rebellious phase.

758
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,620
Do you think opening a shop is easy?

759
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,780
Just let her try it out.

760
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,260
She doesn't know what failure is.

761
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,220
Let her experience failure
and face setbacks.

762
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,940
As she said,

763
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,660
she'll continue her studies
if she fails.

764
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,220
Do you really think she's eighteen?

765
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm asking you.
Are you going to do something?

766
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,060
- Will you do something?
- I will.

767
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,550
All you do is mess with these things.

768
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,140
Will you take care of this?

769
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,740
Will you?

770
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,940
I will.

771
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,340
I certainly will.

772
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,180
(Han Xiaoli)

773
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,600
(These expired products
are considered hazardous waste.)

774
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,220
(The garbage collection station
is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.)

775
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,620
(Later, head to the store)

776
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,740
(and handle it, Chen.)

777
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,380
What about you?

778
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,900
(I stayed up late to post listings
and urgently need to catch some sleep.)

779
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,780
You say my conduct is not upright

780
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,780
and even humiliated my mom.

781
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,380
I'll give everything back to you.

782
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,860
(First prize. Champion)

783
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,540
Everyone.

784
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,220
Look at the cabinet on the right.

785
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,380
They are all the honors
Captain Su received.

786
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
On the left

787
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
are all the awards
and medals

788
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,580
that my beloved ex-captain received.

789
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
All of you should learn from them.

790
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,710
Looks like Captain Su is quite capable.

791
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,140
Alright. Stop chatting.

792
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,620
The food is done, so come and eat.

793
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,100
Sure. Coming.

794
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,740
Let's go. Time to eat.

795
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,500
Hurry up.

796
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,500
Here. Sit.

797
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,640
These are home-cooked dishes.

798
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,100
Eat whatever you like.

799
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,300
Have some.

800
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,700
I'll go.

801
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,900
Who is it?

802
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,740
Do you have any dietary restrictions?

803
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,540
This fish has a bit more spice.

804
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,060
Are you Mr. Su Qingche?

805
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,820
I am.

806
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,220
The sender is Happy Kitten.

807
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,180
Please sign for it.

808
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,860
Is that so? Sure.

809
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,180
Here.

810
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,860
Thank you.

811
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,860
Happy Kitten?

812
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,260
Qingche.

813
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,180
You have a package.

814
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,060
It's from a Happy Kitten.

815
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,620
What kitten?

816
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,710
What are you talking about?

817
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,620
Is it something embarrassing?

818
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,180
Why not open it here? Right?

819
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,820
- Right.
- Open it.

820
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,540
Qingche.

821
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,260
(Stardust Rogue)
Didn't know you were freaky.

822
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,980
Qingche.

823
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,660
Don't worry.

824
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,220
I've already warned them.

825
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,580
This matter won't spread anymore.

826
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,220
Can you tell me

827
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,500
what my current image
is within the team?

828
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,540
The sexy prince
who just returned to the country.

829
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,900
(Group chat: That's so embarrassing.)

830
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,100
(The sender is called Happy Kitten.
Hands down to the captain.)

831
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,820
Lin Mu is really something,

832
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,420
gossiping and adding you into the chat.

833
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,620
That's so dumb.

834
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,140
(Grandpa: Come home
and explain who is Happy Kitten.)

835
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,380
They're purely gossiping.

836
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,220
But you seem

837
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,260
addicted to ratting me out.

838
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,180
I'm curious as to how you

839
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,740
managed to report
to my grandpa behind my back

840
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,580
while telling me

841
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,740
that you'll never betray me.

842
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,900
I just used a little sweet talk.

843
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,540
Oh, right. Qingche.

844
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,900
Didn't you want to talk to me

845
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,340
about expanding our team's influence

846
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,280
and cooperating
with various sectors of society?

847
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,700
I put in a lot of effort

848
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,860
and finally secured a rescue exercise.

849
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,500
Yes.

850
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,340
Only by expanding
our rescue team's influence

851
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,700
can we receive more rescue missions.

852
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,340
Right.

853
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,260
But

854
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,620
you, don't change the subject on me.

855
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,780
How would I dare to change the subject?

856
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,210
I just want to save you some dignity

857
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,500
so everyone can forget about this.

858
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,000
Do you want my help
in saving yours?

859
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,540
No. I don't have any dignity.

860
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,540
No need. Don't me mad.

861
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,910
You can scold me,
but don't touch my hair.

862
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,500
Then you'd better remember this lesson

863
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,620
