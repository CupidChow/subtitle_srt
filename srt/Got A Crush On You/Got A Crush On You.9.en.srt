I went to the dorm today.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,610
The dormitory assistant said

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,120
she found some letters in the mailbox.

28
00:01:58,123 --> 00:01:59,560
They were all addressed to you.

29
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:00,218
Letters?

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,900
After so many years,
why are there still letters?

31
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,820
I don't know.

Professor.

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,500
Is this your girlfriend from back then?

37
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,180
Allow me to ask.

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,700
Is she my senior?

39
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,740
A beautiful memory from the past.

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,380
Why did you break up?

41
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,820
Reality.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,460
We couldn't find a compromise.

43
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,700
That's a pity.

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,780
Now that you're back,

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,500
if both of you are still unmarried,

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,425
there's a chance
to rekindle the relationship.

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,134
She might not feel

48
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,334
the same way about me anymore.

49
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,580
That's nothing.

50
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,350
Try to win her back.

51
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,280
You're handsome, decent,

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,320
and a university professor.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,700
Definitely a high-quality man.

54
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,380
Alright, get off work.

55
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,580
Go home.

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,420
Awake now?

60
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,460
Your toiletries are in the bathroom.

61
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,381
Use them as you like.

62
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
You are...

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,820
I'm cooking porridge.

64
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,300
It's overcooked.

65
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,060
No big deal. Hurry up.

66
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,980
Let me do it.

67
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,060
Has your fever subsided?

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,220
It has. Don't worry.

69
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,140
Then I'll leave it to you.

70
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,581
I don't know how to cook anyway.

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,461
Is there anything left in the fridge?

72
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,820
Not bad.

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,340
There are some vegetables.

74
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,836
My parents cooked the last time
they visited.

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,220
These are leftovers from last time.

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,940
Looks delicious.

77
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,860
If you like it,

78
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,180
I can cook it for you every day.

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Every day?

80
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,740
Are you trying to stay here?

81
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,500
Didn't you invite me here yourself?

82
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,534
So, you want to freeload on my food?

83
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,220
I've cooked everything.

84
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,100

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,500
I...

86
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,180
What I?

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,820
Look at you stuttering.

88
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,660
I was just kidding.

89
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,820
So, can I?

90
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,420

If you're done, hurry up and leave.

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,120
Why are you in such a rush
to get rid of me?

96
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,060
Otherwise?

97
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,734
Do you still want to hang around here?

98
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,860
I still have a bit of a headache.

99
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,900
Headache?

100
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,140
Really?

101
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,940
There's nothing I can do about it.

102
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:23,260
Go.

103
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,740
No, wait.

104
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,220

109
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,580
Go find Lu Qun then.

110

But

126
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,450
looking at the number of registrations

127
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,060
and the volume of reports,

128
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,860

we need to step up our efforts.

132

But Qin,

133
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,180
you're handling Weibo and public account

134
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,180
very well.

135
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,380

136
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:56,940
No.

137
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,080
It's mainly Captain Su's quick thinking.

138
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,290
He came up with the idea.

139
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,580
Alright.

140
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Now,

141
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,860
let's continue to work hard.

142
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,180
Hopefully, next year,

143

Sorry.

Do I need an appointment to see Qingche?

156

May I ask your name, miss?

157

I don't know.

Probably another girl enchanted
by Captain Su's charm.

166

I must say. She's quite pretty.

167

Right?

168
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,020
Really?

169
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,860
Go quickly.

there's a Miss Gao looking for you.)

with the last name Gao recently?

Gao. Gao Qingyin.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,460

Qin, wait for a moment.

179
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,300
How did she come?

180
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,100
Last night, you were with Xingchen.

181
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,260
She came looking for you.

182
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,909
I stopped her.

183
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,145
She must be anxious today.

184
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,020
Qin, she's waiting at the front desk,
right?

185
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,660
No.

186
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,378
I asked her to wait
in the reception room.

187
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,540
Let her come up.

188
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,260
(Alright.)

189
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,940
This is bad.

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,010
If she finds out about you and Xingchen,

191
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,021
she'll definitely explode.

192
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:49,380
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.

193
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,580
Where are you going?

194
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,260
It's not that scary, right?

195
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,660
Just spend more time with her.

196
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,300
I accompany her?

197
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,790
Why don't you find me for good things?

198
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:57,420
Goodbye.

199
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,665
You must accompany me.

200
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,340
Listen.

201
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,500
I'm not joining you today.

202
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,060
Surprise.

203
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,540
Qingyin, you're back.

204
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,100
You're here.

205
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,940
Qingche.

206
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,460
I missed you so much.

207
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,420
Qingyin.

208
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,129
You changed your clothes today.

209
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,420
You look radiant.

210
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,020
Not bad.

211
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,700
You look good.

212
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,339
Why didn't you guys feel surprised

213
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,220
when you saw me?

214
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,580
- We are.
- Of course, we are.

215
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,140
Yes.

216
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,180
Qingche, I bought a gift for you.

217
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,300
Wait a moment.

218
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,819
More like shocked.

219
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,909
Can you react faster later?

220
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,520
When she comes, you pull her away. Okay?

221
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,030
Alright.

222
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,900
You even prepared a gift.

223
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,660
There's no need.

224
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,260
Look.

225
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,580
I made this.

226
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,160
If you put it on the table,

227
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,180
it can accompany you.

228
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,220
Does it look like me?

229
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,380
How is it? Beautiful?

230
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,180
Nice.

231
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,500
From now on, it can accompany you.

232
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,740
It looks a bit like Han Xiaoli.

233
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:50,300
And this tie.

234
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Do you like this color?

235
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,860
There's our initials on it.

236
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,420
Time for a new watch, too.

237
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,780
Look.

238
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,660
How is it? Do you like it?

239
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,860
It does look good.

240
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,865
Do you like it?

241
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,220
Babe,

242
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,900
have some fruits.

243
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,860
He stayed over at your place yesterday.

244
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,740
What's on your mind?

245
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,500
Your face is red.

246
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,940
Looks like there's a chance.

247
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,220
I hinted at him.

248
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,260
And then...

249
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,780
And then?

250
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,340
I told him I would date him,

251
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,300
but he didn't respond.

252
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,980
He fell asleep instead.

253
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,980
I was speechless.

254
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,300
So, was he genuinely unaware,

255
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,690
or was he intentionally ignoring it?

256
00:12:29,694 --> 00:12:30,820
I have no idea.

257
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,620
Anyway,

258
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,020
I'm not repeating it.

259
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,570
What are you looking for?

260
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:44,740
I lost one of my earrings.

261
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,060
Isn't that great?

262
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,487
Out with the old, in with the new.

263
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,890
It's a good chance to buy a new one.

264
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,540
No, I can't.

265
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,780
I have OCD.

266
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780
I have to find it,

267
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,905
or I'll be really annoyed.

268
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,140
Qingche.

269
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,070
Qingyin.
I see you're wearing high heels today.

270
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,300
You must be tired from walking.

271
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,290
Let's sit and talk. Come.

272
00:13:00,298 --> 00:13:00,700
Sit there.

273
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,140
Have a seat.

274
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,940
Sit down and talk.

275
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,750
- Take your time.
- Yes, have a seat.

276
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,340
Take your time.

277
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,500
Actually, I can...

278
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,740
It's okay. Sit back down.

279
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,860
Qingyin, listen to Qun.

280
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,340
It's easy to sprain your ankle

281
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,225
in such high heels.

282
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,820
He's right.

283
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,420
Okay.

284
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,140
I only listen to you, Qingche.

285
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,980
(Song Xingchen)

286
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,180
So, what should we eat today?

287
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,140
Let's not.

288
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,992
Maybe in two days.

289
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,620
After I finish the work on my hands,

290
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,380
I'll arrange a welcome dinner for you,
okay?

291
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,940
Okay.

292
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,180
I've decided on the place.
You decide on the time.

293
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,500
It'll be just the two of us.

294
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,540
Qingyin.

295
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,140
Let me show you around the place.

296
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,460
- I mean it.
- You don't have to.

297
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,120
Look at how interesting
their training is.

298
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,420
Go ahead. Go with Qun.

299
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,159
Go ahead, Qingyin.

300
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,100
- I'm not going.
- Go.

301
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,140
- Qingche.
- They're all interesting people.

302
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,020
It's cool. Look.

303
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,639
This is strength training,
with comprehensive equipment.

304
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,949
There's also a canoe over there.

305
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,740
Look over there.

306
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,860
So many muscular guys
are training there.

307
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,030
And there's physical training
on that side.

308
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,150
There's also rock climbing.

309
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,140
- Over there is...
- Lu.

310
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,260
Who's Song Xingchen?

311
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,500
She's a teammate of ours.

312
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,820
How old is she?

313
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,900
What does she do?

314
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,860
Is she pretty?

315
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,780
I heard she's a businesswoman.

316
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,025
She's not pretty.

317
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,060
Not as pretty as you.

318
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,580
Does she come often?

319
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,340
Just once or twice.

320
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,060
You know me.

321
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,860
I only look at pretty girls.

322
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:17,700
Others can't be seen.

323
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,340
Lu, I want to play that.

324
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,140
Sure.

325
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,003
I'll get it for you.

326
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,220
Why is it here with me?

327
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,500
Doesn't this big earring
feel heavy to you?

328
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,100
I finally sent that troublemaker away.

329
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,020
I need a break.

330
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,540
What is this? Is it hers?

331
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,620
Hold on.

332
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,940
That's Song Xingchen's, isn't it?

333
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,100
You sure made rapid progress.

334
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:21,100
How intense of you.

335
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,300
Don't be ridiculous.

336
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,660
I must've accidentally

337
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,980
brought it out from her place.

338
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,140
Why didn't I notice it yesterday?

339
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,500
I'll call FlashEx.

340
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,660
Are you stupid?

341
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,360
This is such a good opportunity.

342
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,180
You have to seize it.

343
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:38,500
Take the chance and ask her out.

344
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,820
Oh, right.

345
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,180
I was a bit out of it last night,

346
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,460
but

347
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,700
I believe

348
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,060
I heard something she said.

349
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,220
What a woman wants
is to be unequivocally possessed.

350
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,020
What did you answer?

351
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,900
I said I was a bit out of it.

352
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,740
I...

353
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,980
I think I answered her,

354
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,140
but I don't remember what I said.

355
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,220
You've really met a pro this time.

356
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,180
She's not an ordinary girl.

357
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,900
For her,

358
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,580
you're a novice in love,

359
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,020
while she's the expert one.

360
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,480
Think about it.

361
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,900
How coincidental is it

362
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,460
that you happened
to bring out an earring from her place?

363
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
She's giving you a chance
to ask her out,

364
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:26,860
forcing you to take the initiative.

365
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,700
I'll just tell her first

366
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,220
that her earring is with me, right?

367
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,040
(Su Qingche: Your earring is with me.)

368
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,140
So, it's with you.

369
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,440
Sure made me search high and low.

370
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,380
What are you saying?

371
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,420
So, when do you plan to return it to me?

372
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,260
She replied.

373
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,140
She asked when I'd return it to her.

374
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,260
How about I text...

375
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,260
Don't rush.

376
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,180

Meeting you again, a sweet concern.

380
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,820
Bro.

381
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
It's cheesy.

382
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,540
I didn't date

383
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,759
through the entire alphabet,

384
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,199
but I've covered all 12 zodiac signs.

385
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,340
Just reply as what I've said.

386
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,300
Add one more line.
"How about dinner tonight?"

387
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,380
What was it again?

388
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,540
Lost isn't the earring

389
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,980
but my grace of return.
Meeting you again, a sweet concern.

390
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,020
And then,
ask her out for dinner tonight.

391

393
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,060
When did he become so cheesy?

394
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,820
Is that something Captain Su said?

395
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,360

I'll return it to you.)

I'll go if I have no plans tonight.)

Who is it?

398
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,960
My package has arrived.

399
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,900
Babe, listen.

400
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,700
Our store's order rate
has declined recently.

401
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,460
What about
degrading your consumption?

402
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,900
Babe, this isn't consumption.

403
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,940
I'm planning

404
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,990
to include women's products
in our sales range.

405
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,340
Yeah.

406
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,469
If we only sell lingerie,

407
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,300
our repeat purchase rate won't increase.

408
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,119
I went with Polar Night
to deliver vaccines

409
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,660
and learned that many girls on the team

410
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
didn't even know
how to use tampons.

411
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,300
It shows market gaps for women's items.

412
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,380
So, what you bought is...

413
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,460
For studying.

414
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,112
Take a look at this model.

415
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,460
We need to research

416
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,700
why their product sales are so high.

417
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,820
I know this one.

418
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,087
It's quite popular recently.

419
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,180
We should learn

420
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,980
how they choose and market.

421
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,860
Well,

422
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,060
it's never too old to learn.

423
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,540
Look how cute their packaging is.

424
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,300
It's very innovative.

425
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,220
It's never too old to learn.

426
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,500
The chance is here.

427
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,500
What?

Babe, listen.

431

The past is the past.

432
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,540
Don't jump back into the fire pit.

433
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,020
Do you know

434
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,860
what it means

435
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,220
when a woman shows no interest

436
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,980
in her ex?

437
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,420
It means he's not even a man

438
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,620
in my eyes.

(Haicheng University)
Our main topic today

440
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,043
is e-commerce's several characteristics.

441
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,920
(Characteristics of E-commerce)
Look at the screen.

442
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,580
The first is universality.

443
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,460
It means that e-commerce

444
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,300
is a platform

445
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,340
that can change the way consumers,
businesses,

446
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,740
banks, governments, and others transact.

447
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,420
Its scope of use

448
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,220
possesses the feature of universality.

449
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,420
He's surprisingly popular.

450
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,900
The second

451
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,060
is coordination.

452
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,620
Companies

453
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,460
will analyze value curves

454
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,420
to better meet consumers' expectations
and demands

455
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,660
and achieve higher profits.

456
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,580
Does anyone have any other questions?

457
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,167
Feel free to raise your hand and ask.

458
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,220
You there.

459
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,300
Do you have any questions?

460
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,860
Professor Tang. I'd like to ask

461
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,829
how to attract one's own consumers

462
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,100
in the vast online market.

463
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,100
The first

464
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,220
is precise differentiated positioning.

465
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,300
And the second

466
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,900
is unique brand-added value.

467
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,340
We can take Catherine's Secret
as an example.

468
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,420
What are its consumer's traits?

469
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,700
Sophisticated urban women.

470
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,740
Since its success caters

471
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,340
to the needs of this consumer segment,

472
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,660
here comes a question.

473
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,340
How did it become neglected?

474
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Lack of inclusivity.

475
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,740
Only women with superior figures

476
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,620
are the largest buying group.

477
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,060
Putting consumers' interests first

478
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,100
decides
whether a service-oriented company

479
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,340
can achieve greatness.

480
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,020
Sophisticated urban women.

481
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:25,500
The principles are interchangeable.

482
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,700
Therefore,
delving deep into the supply chain

483
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,860
and ensuring quality
is essential for survival.

484
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,380
Take a seat.

485
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,825

486
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,887
Class dismissed.

487
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,580
Sir, I have another question.

488
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,970
How can costs be managed effectively

489
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,940
in e-commerce operations?

490
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,540
Sir, how do we expand our online store?

491
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,780
Sir, I also have a question.

492
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,060
Xingchen.

493
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,407
You're leaving already?

494
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,940
I'm here to learn.

495
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,460
Thanks for answering my question.

496
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,940
You came to attend my class.

497
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,820
It's my honor.

498
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,060
Let me take you back.

499
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,660
No need. I can go back easily.

500
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,380
On the way back,

501
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,500
I can help you answer some

502
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,723
questions about the store.

503
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,740
Alright.

504
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,940
Let's go.

505
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,100
How did she come?

506
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,039
Based on the direction,

507
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,300
she probably just
finished Professor Tang's open class.

508
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,879
You said last time

509
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,000
that your aunt had a relationship
with Professor Tang.

510
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,540
Is that her?

511
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,250
Something's going on between them.

512
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
If I remember correctly,

513
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,820
your aunt runs an online store, right?

514
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,700
It's closely related to your main theme

515
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,698
of internet economy.

516
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,260
That makes sense.

517
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,520
From your store's series of analyses,

518
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,900
I see price reduction, clearance,
and reduction of products.

519
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,527
Since you've already found the problem,

520
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,660
you should have some preliminary ideas.

521
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,940
I want to expand our store's products

522
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,420
from single-use items

523
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,860
to women's products.

524
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,380
You're doing product consignment now.

525
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,420
Maybe you can develop your own brand
in the future.

526
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,620
I also think so.

527
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,300
I've set my sights on a Japanese brand.

528
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,420
You're still the same as before.

529
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,356
You always want to do things well.

530
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,380
You know me.

531
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,140
I never give up
what I want to do easily.

532
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,860
If you need support, just say it.

533
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,020
Thank you.

534
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,820

535
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,260
No need.

There's no free lunch in this world.

537

You don't even accept a meeting gift?

538
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,800
If I accept, I must return your favor.

539
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,460
I'm so stingy.

540
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,900
I won't buy anything for you.

541
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,820
Okay.

542
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,040
I was abrupt.

00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,980
♪If tomorrow is another sunny day♪

564
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,860
♪Shall we make a date at this moment♪

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,020
♪Don't let me miss you too much♪

566
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,340
♪If tomorrow brings raindrops♪

567
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,900
You're becoming more and more
like a hipster.

568
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,660
The past doesn't matter anymore.

569
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,820
It's all in the past.

570
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,260
I'm sorry

571
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,709
about things from before.

572
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,100
I chose to go abroad.

573
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,980
It's been so many years.

574
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,900
I've already moved on.

575
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,820
Back then, we were still young.

576
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,300
Everyone have the right

577
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
to pursue their dreams.

578
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,738
You had your persistence,

579
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,460
and of course, I had mine.

580
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,460
No matter what,

581
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,500
we're still friends now.

582
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,180
If you need any help,

583
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,232
just ask me anytime.

584
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,660
Don't worry.

585
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,420
I will.

586
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,621
How about I treat you to dinner tonight?

587
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,140
Or let me treat you.

588
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,240
After all,
you helped me sort out my thoughts.

589
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,930
Sounds reasonable.

590
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,930
What do you want to eat?

591
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,660
(Su Qingche)

592
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,780
Wait a moment.

593
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,180
(Su Qingche: What do you want to eat?
Your earring is calling you.)

594
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,020
(Song Xingchen: Sorry.
Something came up. Let's reschedule.)

595
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,580
(Sorry.)

596
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,796
(Something came up today.)

597
00:26:13,818 --> 00:26:14,660
(Let's reschedule.)

598
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
(Su Qingche: Okay.)

599
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,500
Mengnan.

600
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,340
Where's my bag?

601
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,740
Wait for me here.

602
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,820
I'll go up and get it.

603
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,140
Plan failed.

604
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,020
What plan?

605
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,209
Why are you back again?

606
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,934
Aren't you...

607
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,180
What's wrong? Not happy to see me?

608
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,700
I forgot to take my bag.

609
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,740
By the way,

610
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,180
you haven't answered my question.

611
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,540
What plan?

612
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,129
There was supposed
to be a dinner appointment,

613
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,990
but it's canceled now.

614
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,660
Well then,

615
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,780
how about you come with me for dinner?

616
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,919
What's wrong?
Why not get down?

617
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,420
It's too high. I can't get down.

618
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,660
Can you help me down?

619
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,100
It's not that high.

620
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,900
Come on.

621
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,700
Let's go.

622
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,740
Let's go.

623
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,300
Walk slower.

624
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,820
My feet hurt.

625
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,460
That's why I told you
to change your shoes.

626
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,220
But you wouldn't.

627
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,860
I won't. These are limited edition.

628
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,945
I need to let them come out
and see the world.

629
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,140
I think the back of my heel
is rubbed raw.

630
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,260
Can you help me?

631
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,420
You're really something. Come.

632
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,460
Su Qingche.

633
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,460
What a coincidence.

634
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,180
Is this a date?

635
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,461
This is my sister, Gao Qingyin.

636
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:29,940
Not a sister.

637
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,100
Just a neighbor

638
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,661
I've watched grow up since childhood.

639
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,580
Sister?

640
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,420
We're childhood sweethearts.

641
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,060
- You are...
- Qingyin, stop it.

642
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,660
I'm Song Xingchen.

643
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,640
(Song Xingchen)

644
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,780
Hello, Xingchen.

645
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,580
Qingche, my foot still hurts.

646
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,140
Then I'll let Lu Qun
take you to the hospital.

647
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,660
I think I can endure a little longer.

648
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,980
Are they your friends?

649
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,180
Who is this?

650
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,700
Hi, I'm Tang Ruize.

651
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,363
Xingchen's friend from university.

652
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,500
Ex-boyfriend.

653
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,500
I thought exes were supposed

654
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,300
to avoid each other at all costs.

655
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,820
I thought childhood sweethearts

656
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,007
were supposed to have
a pure neighborly relationship.

657
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,580
(She told me she was busy.)

658
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,700
(Turns out she's
meeting her ex-boyfriend.)

659
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,140
(He found a replacement)

660
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,540
(as soon as I flaked on him.)

661
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,860
(Quite the options, huh?)

662
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,900
In the adult world,

663
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,180
there's no "avoiding each other".

664
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,669
Only "not willing to interact".

665
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,700
You're so right.

666
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,420
Just like I'm Qingche's ex-girlfriend.

667
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,460
But also current...

668
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:41,180
No, you...

669
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,980
There's your favorite steak here.

670
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,820
Do you remember?

671
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,220
I don't want to eat. Okay?

672
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,380
Qingche.

673
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,420
Qingche, where are we going?

674
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,620
Rather than choosing a day,

675
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,620
why not today?

676
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,980
It's lively.

677
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Originally, Captain Su wanted to treat.

678
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,340
Right?

679
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,420
Let's go.

680
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,500
Qingyin, what nonsense are you talking about?

681
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,819
What ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend?

682
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,060
Qingche, I'm helping you.

683
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,860
Are you helping me?

684
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,043
You're causing trouble for me.

685
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,432
What's your relationship with her?

686
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,900
She's my teammate.

687
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,180
Do you like her?

688
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,180
Is it that obvious?

689
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,980
Then that's settled.

690
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,380
She's acting arrogant
because she has an ex-boyfriend.

691
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,749
You should also have an ex.

692
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,390
You can't lose.

693
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,290
I don't have an ex.

694
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:30,950
I am.

695
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:31,420
You are not.

696
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,820
You can't lose.

697
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,740
Let's go.

698
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,060
Come on. Just listen to me.

699
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,020
What are you doing?

700
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,860
Qingche.

701
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,780
There's your favorite Borscht soup.

702
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,740
Should we order it?

703
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,940
Anything is fine.

704
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,620
Good evening, everyone.

705
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,400
Today, we are offering
a couple's special.

706
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,847
Would you like to give it a try?

707
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,500
Excuse me, we're not...

708
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,345
That works. It saves us from ordering.

709
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,140
Two sets, please.

710
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,940
Alright, any dietary restrictions?

711
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,420
Ours should be non-spicy.

712
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,832
Qingche can't handle spicy.

713
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,660
Make ours extra spicy.

714
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,785
Professor Tang and I love spicy food.

715
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,860
Mr. Tang.

716
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,060
What's your profession?

717
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,660
I teach at university.

718
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,580
Did you and Xingchen
know each other in university?

719
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,098
How long have you been together?

720
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,180
Two years.

721
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,700
Campus love,

722
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,940
so enviable.

723
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,930
You mentioned having something to do.

724
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,740
I attended Professor Tang's class

725
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,540
and gained a lot.

726
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,580
Nice.

727
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,420
A date after class

728
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,500
sounds good.

729
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,460
You have plenty of dating options

730
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,580
to choose from.

731
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,820
Why bother?

732
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,980
Xingchen.

733
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,740
You and Professor Tang
seemed compatible.

734
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,020
It's a shame things didn't work out.

735
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,940
Getting married would've been

736
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,338
the icing on the cake.

737
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,980
It's regrettable.

738
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Your earring.

739
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,500
How did your earring end up
with Qingche?

740
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,380
I slept over at her place,

741
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,460
and accidentally brought it back.

742
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,620
Slept over at her place?

743
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,900
How's my couch for sleeping?

744
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,580
It's comfy,

745
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,660
but a bit short.
I can't stretch out my legs.

746
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,060
Indeed, it's inappropriate.

747
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,740
If you're ever homeless,

748
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,500
don't suffer at my place.

749
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,700
My place has more rooms.

750
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,500
Next time...

751
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,380
No need.

752
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,780
Qingche, can you help me cut the steak?

753
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
I can't cut it myself.

754
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,140
Here you go.

755
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,540
I remember you like broccoli.

756
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,700
Thanks.

757
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,820
Sure.

758
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,460
Qingche, feed me.

759
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,900
Okay.

760
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,460
So delicious.

761
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,260
Excuse me.

762
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,740
I need to use the restroom.

763
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,940
Qingche, I'm going too.

764
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,060
Thanks.

765
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,140
Unexpectedly,

766
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,420
you won Qingche over your side

767
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,420
in the few weeks I was away
on a business trip.

768
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,229
Fate has a funny way of intervening,

769
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,580
and there's no stopping it.

770
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,900
Such fate

771
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,340
came a bit late

772
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,660
in your life.

773
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,860
I'll support him in what he knows

774
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,660
and teach him what he doesn't.

775
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,380
Or do I have to be like you,

776
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,180
unable to cut a steak?

777
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,740
You're just a fling.

778
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,660
Unlike me,

779
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,780
I've known Qingche since childhood.

780
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,060
Yet,

781
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,345
you still ended up
being his ex-girlfriend.

782
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,020
Do you know how many admirers

783
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,620
I've helped him fend off?

784
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,540
You don't know him.

785
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
It was just a dare,

786
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,940
or else, could I still be sitting here

787
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,930
as his ex-girlfriend?

788
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,420
Girl.

789
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,940
You two don't look like exes.

790
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,300
I didn't expect you,
who claimed to be single,

791
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,589
to have an ex-girlfriend.

792
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,020
When did you two start dating?

793
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,621
- Two years ago.
- Since childhood.

794
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,625
How long did you date?

795
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:15,810
- Three years.
- Six months.

796
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
I secretly admired him
for two and a half years.

797
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,740
Here.

798
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,260
Your favorite.

799
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,740
Thanks.

800
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,540
Mr. Su.

801
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,974
Do you have a girlfriend now?

802
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,500
Not at the moment.

803
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,020
Since I was little, I've decided

804
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,540
I'll only marry Qingche.

805
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,140
How about we get back together?

806
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,100
Let's stop this act.

807
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,620
See.

808
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,980
Pursuing Qingche
is like melting ice. It takes work.

809
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,420
I have someone I like.

810
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,060
Who's the girl?

811
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,300
I feel stuffy in here.

812
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,580
I need some fresh air.

813
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,380
Sure.

814
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,580
Since we've finished eating,

815
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:22,610
how about we leave now?

816
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:27,660
Let's go.

817
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,260
I'll send you home.

818
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,647
It's fine. I can manage on my own.

819
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,140
Let me give you a ride.
I'm going the same way.

820
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,740
Alright, thanks.

821
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,820
Bye.

822
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,700
Qingche, my parents have urgent matters

823
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,658
and need me to go home.

824
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:47,540
Let Professor Tang take Xingchen home.

825
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,258
Alright. I know you need to go home.

826
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,152
I'll take you then.

827
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,860
Qingche.

828
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:51,620
I got it.

829
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,020
She didn't show any concern to you

830
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,220
and wasn't jealous, either.

831
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,500
She definitely doesn't like you.

832
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,780
The car is here. Get in.

833
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
To Century Garden.

834
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,334
Aren't you coming with me?

835
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,363
I have something to attend to.
You go first.

836
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,060
Qingche.

837
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,120
(Yintai Mall)

838
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,460
(Qingyin)

839
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,620
Hey, Qingyin.

840
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,100
How did Song Xingchen and Qingche meet?

841
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,580
Why are you asking this?

842
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,460
Don't fool me. I know all about it.

843
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,500
Come on, tell me.

844
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,220
Otherwise, you won't have peaceful days.

845
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,380
They met through a blind date.

846
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,620
A blind date?

847
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,460
Yeah.

848
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,420
Grandpa selected Song Xingchen

849
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,940
as a blind date candidate.

850
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,120
(Mengnan)

851
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,780
Hey.

852
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,980
(How was the dinner with Qingche?)

853
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,420
There was a bit of a situation.

854
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,100
No.

855
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,060
I'll not let her linger around Qingche.

856
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,420
(But you're going to Paris
for a fashion show.)

857
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:33,460
(This is the opportunity
you've always wanted.)

858
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,220
I'm not going.

859
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,800
(You and Qingche
have been friends for so long,)

860
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,090
(and nothing has changed.)

861
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:39,660
(Why not focus on your career)

862
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,380
(and elevate yourself?)

863
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,500
No matter what,

864
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,060
I won't give up easily.

865
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,989
About that boy from earlier...

866
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,494
Have you known him for a long time?

867
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,549
It's still all very new.

868
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,740
Do you like him?

869
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,980
Who wouldn't like

870
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,060
someone lively and cheerful?

871
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,540
I feel old

872
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,860
when you say that,

873
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,340
especially mentally.

874
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,930
Calling yourself old?

875
00:39:12,952 --> 00:39:13,620
What a joke.

876
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,019
The people who attended your class today

877
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,540
were there to see the handsome

878
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,580
and knowledgeable you.

879
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
Do you think so, too?

880
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,920
What are you doing?

881
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,100
What was all that about?

882
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,940
Is it necessary to explain to you?

883
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,940
Captain Su.

884
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,820
If you encounter this situation,

885
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,843
your girlfriend goes
to see her ex-boyfriend,

886
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,780
what will you do?

887
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,380
He's already in the past.

888
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,700
What are you?

889
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,100
Present.

890
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,140
The most important thing
is to seize the present.

891
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,949
What I asked wasn't about that.

892
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,220
What was it then?

893
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,900
I said I liked someone.

894
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,340
Why did you nudge me
under the table with your leg?

895
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,040
That's because you and Gao Qingyin

896
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,140
teamed up to tease me,

897
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,260
making me feel uncomfortable.

898
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,900
You're not exes, right?

899
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,710
Of course not.

900
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,450
I haven't been in a relationship.
It was ...

901
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:28,260
No need to explain.

902
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,540
I don't want to know.

903
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
Are you jealous?

904
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,820
Jealous? It's you, Captain Su.

905
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,820
Yes.

906
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,260
I'm jealous.

907
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,180
I won't give you any chance

908
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,900
to rekindle old flames

909
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,220
because you're mine.

910
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,020
You have a knack

911
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,580
for talking to yourself.

912
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,100
When did you ever ask
if I agreed or not?

913
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,500
Well, I'm asking you now.

914
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,820
Song Xingchen.

915
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,140
I like you.

916
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,140
Can you be my girlfriend?

917
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,740
No.

918
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:32,940
Why?

919
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,420
There's no space for anyone else

920
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,260
to meddle between us,

921
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,100
be it a sister or a brother.

922
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,980
Your actions today

923
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,220
make me to delay
the start of our relationship.

924
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,300
So, in fact,

925
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,820
you intend to accept me?

926
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,820
It depends on your actions.

927
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,220
