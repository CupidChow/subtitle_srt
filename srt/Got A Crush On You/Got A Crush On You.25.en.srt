=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 25=

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,120
Dad. Mom.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,799
You guys called me home in a hurry.

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,240
What is it?

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
What's wrong?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,240
I have to ask you something.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,920
What is it?

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,440
(Priestley University)

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,720
Mom.

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,239
I was going to find a suitable time
these couple of days

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,239
and break it to you guys.

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,160
Too late for that.

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
Mom.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,799
This isn't my fault.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
I got the news on short notice.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Besides,

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,999
I'm just going overseas

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
to learn some advanced
medical skills.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,199
I'll come back to serve the nation.

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
And the people.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,279
I know.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,439
It's normal for people

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,919
who study medicine

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,719
to start working at thirty.

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,880
It's not that I don't support you,

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,640
but what about Su?

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,159
You two have finally settled down,

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,759
but now you're planning something else.

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,519
You keep having second thoughts.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,399
Do you want to continue
with this relationship?

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,360
Mom, there's no conflict
between these things.

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,520
Qingche and I have made a promise.

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,079
When I study abroad,

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,159
we will fulfill

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,439
the dreams we want to.

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,760
That's good, isn't it?

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,279
What promise?

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,799
Even young couples who live together

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,280
break up nowadays.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,510
Not to mention long distance couples
like you two. That cannot happen.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,919
Mom, I know.

64
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,880
You don't understand anything.

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,359
Fine.

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,080
This can only be settled with you two
getting married.

67
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,839
Mom, I know what I'm doing.

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,239
Stop getting worried, alright?

69
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,320
What do you know?

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,960
Alright, I don't want to talk to you.

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,560
Mom.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,480
Ma'am.

73
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,200
What are you...

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,240
I have business here.

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,160
What business do you have?

76
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,439
I want to see your captain, Su Qingche.

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,320
Have you made an appointment?

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Appointment?

79
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
I have to make appointments?

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,640
You know Song Xingchen, right?

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
I'm her mother.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,719
Hello, Mrs. Song.

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,440
I'll set you up right away.

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,720
(Captain Su, your mother-in-law is here.)

85
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,739
Captain Su's mother-in-law is coming.

86
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,380
(Captain Su, your mother-in-law is here.)

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,680
Mrs. Song, what brings you here?

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,559
Let's go to my office.

89
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,359
Hello, Mrs. Song.

90
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,639
Hello, Mrs. Song.

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,920
You guys get back to work.

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
That's the office, Mrs. Song.

93
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,120
Let's go inside.

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,719
Mrs. Song.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,639
I washed some fruits.

96
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,760
You can have some.

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,420
I'll get a glass of water for you.

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,440
Su.

99
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,599
Stop it.

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,719
I need to talk to you.

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,519
Right away, Mrs. Song.

102
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
I'll get you a glass of water.

103
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,280
Okay, Mrs. Song. Shoot away.

104
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,640
Last time you were at our place,

105
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I didn't get to talk to you.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,079
Now,

107
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
what do you two

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,240
plan to do?

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,479
We are planning

110
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,800
to keep dating.

111
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,960
Just keep dating?

112
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
What do you mean?

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,119
Men

114
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,839
should take responsibility.

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,400
Of course.

116
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,199
Don't worry, Mrs. Song.

117
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,440
I'll be responsible for Xingchen
my whole life.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,119
Talk is cheap.

119
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,040
I want to see action.

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,479
Mrs. Song, this

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,240
is the ring I'm going to us
to propose to Xingchen.

122
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,560
Actually,

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,359
that night, when she told me

124
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,239
she was going abroad,

125
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
I'd already made up my mind

126
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,120
to propose to her.

127
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,799
I really love your daughter.

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,200
She's the girl I'll protect forever.

129
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,919
I will take good care of her.

130
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,240
Stay with her.

131
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,639
Time and distance

132
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,519
are no problem for me.

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,840
I'll be here

134
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,200
waiting for her.

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,240
Good.

136
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,040
Su.

137
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,119
My daughter

138
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,520
found the right man.

139
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,720
I believe

140
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,480
you can make her happy.

141
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,879
(Gao Qingyin's Moment)

142
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,160
Hello?

143
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,280
Where are you?

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,199
(The rescue team.)

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,560
Okay, wait for me.

146
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:35,162
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,440
Qiancheng.

148
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,879
Tell me the truth.

149
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,280
When did this happen?

150
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,400
You ran all the way here for this?

151
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,200
You and Qingyin are...

152
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,960
Yeah.

153
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,559
This is a mess.

154
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,759
You are Xingchen's nephew,

155
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,040
and Qingyin is my sister.

156
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,680
What's your relationship now?

157
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,919
What else can it be?

158
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,880
We are not related in anyway.

159
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,800
Why?

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,599
Do you two have objections?

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,199
No.

162
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,000
Even if you do, keep it to yourself.

163
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,920
I like her.

164
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,479
I grew up in a matriarchy.

165
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,359
My mom.

166
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,440
Great aunts.

167
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,999
And you, Song Xingchen.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,920
All of you are stronger than men.

169
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,600
Then I met Gao Qingyin.

170
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,559
It was the first time

171
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,440
I felt needed by a girl.

172
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,120
When I see her happy,

173
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,320
I get happy.

174
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,920
Who else would I woo but her?

175
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,400
Have you thought this through?

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,959
What part of her do you like?

177
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,879
Why are you guys...

178
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,680
Do I need a reason to like someone?

179
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,839
If I like someone, I tell them.

180
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
If I love someone, I treat her nice.

181
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,600
Being hesitant

182
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,640
means nothing.

183
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,920
Forget it. Nothing can be changed.

184
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,079
I'm telling you,

185
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,759
she's my sister.

186
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,280
Treat her well. Don't bully her.

187
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,639
You think Gao Qingyin will let herself
get bullied?

188
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,719
You should tell her

189
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,520
not to bully Qiancheng.

190
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,520
Hold on.

191
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,919
You guys go ahead.

192
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,160
And I'll go ahead.

193
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,279
What I meant was

194
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,680
Qiancheng's a guy, so he should
relent for the girl.

195
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm here, lad.

196
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,879
Grandpa? When did you get here?

197
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,160
Why didn't you tell me?

198
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,519
If I didn't come back,

199
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,640
you'd probably forget about me.

200
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,799
I'm sorry.
It's been busy these couple of days.

201
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
Forgot to call you.

202
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,520
Lately, I heard

203
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,239
that Song Xingchen

204
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
is going abroad.

205
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,119
Did Lu Qun tell you that?

206
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Don't change the subject.

207
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,200
Stand firm.

208
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,560
Stand firm and answer my question.

209
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,119
Actually,

210
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,520
the academy she applied to said
they weren't taking any more students.

211
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,040
But now,

212
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,080
a top medical school is taking her in.

213
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,199
She's brilliant, isn't she?

214
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
Shut it, don't change the subject.

215
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,240
What about your relationship?

216
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
Have you settled everything.

217
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,720
I was going to propose.

218
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Nice.

219
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,640
Not bad.

220
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,839
You punk.

221
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,559
Keep going ahead.

222
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,119
Before she goes overseas,

223
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
settle this matter.

224
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,600
This,

225
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
this,

226
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,720
and this. That's all.

227
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120
- Okay, thanks.
- Give us a moment, please.

228
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,559
What's wrong, Ms. Han?

229
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,920
Did you get rich?

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
Yep.

231
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,159
I'm telling you,

232
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,120
our shop just sold

233
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,000
fifty sets of belly wrap.

234
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
Fifty sets?

235
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,960
Really?

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,279
Really. I'm telling you,

237
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,239
the feedback is awesome.

238
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,960
The customers say our product's flexible

239
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,039
and nice to the eyes.

240
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,039
Of course.

241
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,879
It's our shop.

242
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,800
I know.

243
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,540
(I can't open R&N's page.
How can I get my refund?)

244
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
Xiaoli.

245
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,080
Wanru's shop is ruined.

246
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
All gone.

247
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,720
What happened?

248
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,320
Check it out.

249
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
Insider news.

250
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,159
R&N is under audit again
for selling fake stuff.

251
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,360
It's possible

252
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,720
they might close down permanently.

253
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
I knew this would happen.

254
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,199
Honestly,

255
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,879
we've been waiting for Wanru
to get walloped,

256
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,599
but when it really happens,

257
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,320
I feel pity for her.

258
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,879
Years of hard work,

259
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,280
gone.

260
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,120
But think about it this way.

261
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,999
If she's not taught a lesson now,

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,840
she might end up worse down the line.

263
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,040
True.

264
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,840
You have to learn from your mistakes.

265
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,280
That's a good thing.

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,200
Xingchen.

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,960
We're celebrating the team formation's
anniversary tomorrow. Why not come with me?

268
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,840
Sure.

269
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,599
These are the dirty laundry, right?

270
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,640
I'll clean them.

271
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
Xingchen.

272
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,839
You don't need to do that.

273
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,880
You've been exhausted

274
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,399
making new products lately.

275
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,360
I'll clean them.

276
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,400
Do I look that weak?

277
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,199
This is what boyfriends are for.

278
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,880
To help you with your workload.

279
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you, my dear boyfriend.

280
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,479
Babe.

281
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,800
You're here. Come in.

282
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,119
This is what you wear?

283
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,360
What's the complaint?

284
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
It's an important day today.

285
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,359
It'd be rude

286
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,800
if you don't look glamorous.

287
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,719
I think this is good, isn't it?

288
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,559
It's just an anniversary.

289
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Not a fashion show.

290
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,519
I heard all the girls on the rescue team

291
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,039
dress like royalty.

292
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,559
You're the captain's girlfriend.

293
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,400
Even if you don't care about yourself,
at least care about him.

294
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
This is nice.

295
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,279
No, I'm telling you, no.

296
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,920
Let me see.

297
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,159
The pink one's nice.

298
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,279
It fits your skin tone.

299
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
Try this on.

300
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,479
Xiaoli, where are you and Lu Qun?

301
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,799
Did I get the time wrong?

302
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,080
Why isn't there anyone here?

303
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,820

belongs to us.

322
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,520
Xingchen.

323
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,280
I know of your worries.

324
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,280
Because you were abandoned once,

325
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
you're scared.

326
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,600

the same way.

327
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
But you don't have to worry.

328
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,120

329

or distance,

330
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,520
they cannot separate us.

331
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,440
It's just time zone difference.

332
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I can have dinner with you
in the morning.

333
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,960
I can have breakfast with you at night.

334
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,919
I'll video call you before you sleep

335
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,040
so you can look at me.

336
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,120
I will not miss any moment of your life.

337
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,240
What is this?

338
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,280
After putting it on,

339
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,639
we can always

340
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,560
feel each other's heartbeats

341
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,680
as if we're never apart.

342
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,440
No matter when,

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,680
no matter what you're doing,

344
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,000
we will never be apart.

345

Now

346
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,320
is an important time

347
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,760
in your life.

348
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,120
You're pursuing

349
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,639
your career.

350
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,999
It might not

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,920
be a good time

352
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
to make a family.

353
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,120
Before you leave,

354
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,720
I want to give you a promise.

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,600
I,

356
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,960
Su Qingche,

357
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,600
will always love you.

358
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,360
We'll always be in love.

359
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
That's the promise I give you.

360
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,479
I hope one day in the future,

361
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,160
when you are ready,

362
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,560
this is not a necklace anymore.

363
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,599
It will be something you can wear

364
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,760
over your finger.

365
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,160
to become professionals.

449
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,159
Now we are capable

450
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,560
of launching citywide rescues,

That's for the good stuff.

466
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,560
And now it's business.

467
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,360
It's the rainy season now.

468
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,600
Everywhere is impacted.

469
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,520
We have received requests for assistance
from the government.

470
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,120
This mission will be hard,

471
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,400
because we'll dive deep
into the impacted areas.

472
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,679
On top of that, we have also received

473
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,440
orders from the Ministry of
Emergency Management.

474
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,879
Three tourists

475
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,479
have gone missing in the mountains.

476
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,360
We must do all we can

477
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
to find the tourists

478
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,040
and save the victims of the rain.

479
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,360
Get preparing, people.

480
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,520
We'll set off in an hour.

481
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,600
Yes.

483
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Hello, Xingchen.

484
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,839
My mentor

485
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,199
arranged a surgery for me in two days.

486
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,359
It's a critical patient.

487
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
I need to join.

488
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,200
That's why

489
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,479
I might go home a couple days late.

490
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,200
No problem.

491
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,920
You do your work.

492
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,360
I am going

493
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,200
to my grandpa's for a couple of days.

494
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Take care.

495
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,360
I'll be waiting for you.

496
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,760
Miss you.

497
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,800
Okay.

498
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,680
See you.

499
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,039
You lie to her every time
you have a mission.

500
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,480
Doesn't your conscience hurt?

501
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,840
You're condemning me?

502
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,520
Did you tell Han Xiaoli?

503
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,839
Do I have to?

504
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,239
I never tell this to her.

505
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,760
She listens to me.

506
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120

507
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,160
Present.

508
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,520
You're here.

509
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,640
Why didn't you call me?

510
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,040
What do you have to tell me?

511
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
Why didn't you reply to my texts?

512
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,399
We were in a meeting,

513
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,720
so I didn't have time.

514
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,040
Why are you dressed
like a CEO today?

515
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,439
If I don't dress to kill,

516
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,679
the partners won't listen to me.

517
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880
You have a point.

518
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,679
What, is it ugly?

519
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,199
It's beautiful.

520
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,000
Let's talk in my office.

521
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,360
Come with me. Mind the steps.

522
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,080
Did you really not reply to me
because you were in a meeting?

523
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,880
Yeah, I was in a meeting.

524
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,519
Or do you just not want to reply?

525
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,439
I wouldn't dare.

526
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,000
What would you like for dinner?

527
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,280
Let me think.

528
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,640
Eat what you want.

529
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,320
You must be tired.

530
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,799
Right.

531
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,720
What were you going to tell me?

532
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,360
Um...

533
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,080
We

534
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,439
are actually

535
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,679
going on a mission later.

536
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,479
It'll take a few days.

537
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,519
Out of town and a bit dangerous.

538
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,760
I didn't dare tell.

539
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,280
I thought it was something else.

540
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Go, but be careful.

541
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,320
Really?

542
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,680
You're so understanding.

543
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,720
I'll celebrate your birthday
after I come back.

544
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
It's alright.

545
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,839
I had a meeting before I came,

546
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,600
so I'm thirsty now.

547
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,020
I'll get some water for you right away.

548
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,420
(Goddess Group)

549
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,000
Babe.

550
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,719
I can explain.
It's not what it looks like.

551
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,040
Explain, my foot.

552
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,280
I thought you deleted that chat group.

553
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,960
What is this?

554
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,199
That's my old phone.

555
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,279
It's my alt account in there.

556
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,879
I haven't used it in forever, I swear.

557
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,080
Then why is the battery still on?

558
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,799
You didn't take the phone home

559
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,080
and left it in the office instead.

560
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,000
Bravo, Lu Qun.

561
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,480
You got smart.

562
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,199
No.

563
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,520
Let's break up.

564
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,479
No.

565
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,119
I only changed because I
need to leave town.

566
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,359
It's inconvenient going out of town.
I need a phone.

567
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,119
This isn't my fault.

568
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,719
Xiaoli.

569
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
Xiaoli.

570
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,560
I...

571
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,120
Honestly.

572
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,400
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)
Is this the last batch of necessities?

573
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,040
Yes.

574
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,399
Then it's the medical supplies?

575
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,200
Yep.

576
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,440
Sure.

577
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,280
What should I do?

578
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,840
She misunderstood me again.

579
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,240
Honestly, you.

580
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,999
Alright, stop moaning.

581
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,160
We're setting off soon.

582
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,560
Look alive.

583
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,279
Told you no necklaces

584
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,279
during rescues.

585
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,960
You're breaking the rules. Take it off.

586
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,120
What do you know?

587
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,439
More than you.

588
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,079
You know more than me?

589
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,960
But you should really think

590
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,240
about how you

591
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,720
will face Xiaoli after your come back.

592
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,399
I think

593
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,279
after I come back,

594
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,839
I'll give her

595
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,199
all my phones

596
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,760
and explain everything.

597
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,320
That should settle it, right?

598
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,360
Depends on whether
you're sincere enough.

599
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,320
Alright.

600
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,199
Go over the inventory once.
I'll go to check things out.

601
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,520
Sure, go.

602
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Why aren't you calling me yet today?

603
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,920
Are you at your grandpa's place?

604
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,720
Why aren't you texting or calling?

605
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,179
(Voice Call)

606
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,940
(Qingche)

607
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,540
(No new message from Su Qingche)

608
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,340
(Code range mountain torrent warning)

609
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,919
(News: Haicheng has been impacted
by days of rain.)

610
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,800
(The winds are at level seven or eight.)

611
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,432
(Han Xiaoli)

612
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,960
Hello?

613
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Hello, Xingchen.

614
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,679
Su Qingche and Lu Qun
might be in trouble.

615
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,800
What?

616
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
How's it going?

617
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,759
Can't get through.

618
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,240
I don't know what's going on.

619
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,120
So what should we do now?

620
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,119
Haicheng University set up
an emergency medical team.

621
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,239
I've registered.

622
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,319
Take me to the campus.

623
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,080
You're leaving after you came back?

624
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,840
No matter what,

625
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,839
I need to be at the place
closest to him.

626
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,720
I want to face this with him.

627
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,719
To be honest,

628
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,120
I envy you.

629
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,280
I want to be with Lu Qun,

630
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,040
but I can't help him with anything.

631
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,840
You have to take care of yourself.

632
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,280
Making sure the home ground is safe

633
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,200
is a kind of support too.

634
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,720
Here.

635
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,839
Captain Su.

636
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,720
Water.

637
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,599
You haven't taken a break in three days.

638
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,760
You can't hold on like this.

639
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,680
This path's blocked.

640
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,400
I wonder how Lu is doing.

641
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,680
Any more water?

642
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,359
No.

643
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,600
We finished it long ago.

644
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,039
Any more water?

645
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,879
No.

646
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,080
This is the last bottle.

647
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,960
Thanks.

648
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,999
You three are too bold.

649
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,239
Going outside during a hurricane?

650
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,360
You could die.

651
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,920
What happened to your leg?

652
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,399
It's nothing.

653
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,079
Sit down.

654
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,640
It's fine.

655
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,919
What about that place?

656
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,359
The path we planned

657
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,120
is flooded by sludge.

658
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,840
Debris covers the whole path.

659
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,239
I think

660
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,680
we can only leave
after this hurricane has blown over.

661
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
We don't have that much time.

662
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,759
The situation here is unpredictable.

663
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,520
Our communications with the team
at the mountain base is cut off.

664
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,959
When the hurricane lands,

665
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,480
can this house even hold out?

666
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,200
Alright.

667
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,480
Bear with it.

668
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,759
Yizhu.

669
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,000
Does the medical team need any help?

670
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,479
The medical team's alright.

671
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,559
Is the signal online?

672
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,839
Things aren't looking too good.

673
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,280
The rain's heavy.

674
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,079
Xingchen.

675
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,159
Why are you here?

676
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,639
I'm worried about Qingche and the guys.
So I came with the medical team.

677
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,119
Any news about them?

678
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,279
The station's destroyed.

679
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,839
The signal can't get back online
for a while.

680
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,239
The search will be hard.

681
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,840
We've sent more people to find them.

682
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,039
But don't worry.

683
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,159
Captain Su's experienced.

684
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,959
Even with the communications device
down,

685
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
he can lead them out.

686
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,600
How are things here?

687
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,999
The villages are heavily impacted.

688
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,199
The medical team's stationed here,

689
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,559
so our job is to move critical patients

690
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,999
to the county down there.

691
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,799
I'll get back to work.

692
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,520
Sure.

693
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,080
Can you walk?

694
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,679
It's no problem.

695
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,040
This is no big deal.

696
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,400
Here.

697
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,400
It's alright.

698
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,360
Give me the map.

699
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,880
When I came, the locals told me

700
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,359
there's a shortcut down the mountain.

701
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,640
It's about here.

702
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,399
Is that intel reliable?

703
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,560
That's our only choice.

704
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,599
You guys.

705
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,319
Discard all the stuff you don't need.

706
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,200
We're going light.

707
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,240
Faster.

708
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,480
Pick up the pace.

709
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,360
Keep up. Let's go.

710
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,120
Faster.

711
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,240
You guys go first.

712
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Everyone, keep up.

713
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,239
Control center.

714
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,600
Do you copy me, over?

715
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Here.

716
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,840
Careful.

717
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,599
We need help.

718
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,040
We need help.

719
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Faster.

720
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,520
Careful.

721
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,239
Where does it hurt, child?

722
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,279
My leg.

723
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,080
My leg hurts.

724
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,999
It hurts.

725
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,559
His bone's fractured.

726
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,319
For now, I can only

727
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,679
bandage him and do some simple cleanup.

728
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,999
He needs to be taken
to the hospital.

729
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,119
The ride's on its way.

730
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,359
We'll take him to the hospital now.

731
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,399
Okay, I'll follow.

732
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,160
Sure.

733
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,000
Traffic's stuck ahead.

734
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,700
(Critical Care)

735
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,000
Xingchen.

736
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,180
(Wang Haoran,
allergic to pollen and peanut)

737
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,480
Pollen allergy.

738
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Find it.

739
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Tuck this away.

740
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,079
Breathing difficulty from bloated throat

741
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,279
due to severe allergy.

742
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,399
How should we deal with that?

743
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,759
Any tracheal intubation kit?

744
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,720
No.

745
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,680
Give me the scissors.

746
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,040
And alcohol for disinfection.
And anesthesia.

747
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,400
Scalpel.

748
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
Careful.

749
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Careful.

750
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,840
Captain. Captain Su.

751
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
Captain Su, hold on.

752
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,279
Don't move.

753
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,600
Save me.

754
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,039
Toss the rope down.

755
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
Hold this, captain.

756
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,839
Don't panic.

757
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,320
Strap the rope on tightly.

758
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,559

Done!

760
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,400
Pull!

761
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Mind your step.

762
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
Take it slow. Slow.

763
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,280
- Captain.
- Captain Su.

764
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,439
Captain Su.

765
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Calm down.

766
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,599
Lin Mu, come with me to save him.

767
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,519
