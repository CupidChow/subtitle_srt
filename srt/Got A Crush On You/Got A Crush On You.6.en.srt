Sorry,

30
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,440
I'm late.

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,160
I had an emergency.
I was saving a person.

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,570
It's okay, I understand.

33
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,600
Since we didn't get to see the play,

34
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,250
walk with me then.

35
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,920
This is...

36
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,570
I picked it up at training today.

37
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,570
I thought it looked pretty nice.

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,600
It's really pretty.

39
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,320
You know,

40
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,200
I used to be able to rescue people
without any distractions.

41
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,250
But today, when I went into the water
to save someone,

42
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,640
all I could think about was you.

43
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,760
Dopamine

44
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,570
is just a little joke

45
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,970
played on us by the nerves in our brain,

46
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,520
and it only lasts for six months.

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
Hence, relationship as a couple

48
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,640
may not be as wonderful
as you think it is.

49
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,170
I think the world isn't actually
that wonderful as well

50
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,930
due to disasters,
but it's also those disasters

51
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,130
that make rescue teams'
existence worthwhile.

52
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,730
Therefore, I think

53
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,010
we need to cherish

54
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,960

00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,280

59

Because it's hard to say no

It's late at night,
why are you so angry?

71
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,010
Didn't you go on a date with her today?

72
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,690
Did you get stood up by her?

73
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,960
We kissed.

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,570
What?

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,610
Not bad.

78
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,490
You're such a quick learner,
and you've settled it in one go.

79
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,880
That's not it. At that moment,

80
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,280
I didn't know what has gotten into me,

81
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,080
but it felt

82
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,080
like the moment was right,

83
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,610
so I...

84
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,960
But she didn't turn me down either,

85
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,840
so it wasn't exactly
a forced kiss, right?

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,810
If that's the case,

87
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,930
there are only two possibilities.

88

One, she really does have feelings
for you.

94

You didn't even act this way
during dangerous missions.

It's not as bad as it looks.

96
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,010
No, the point is that I don't know

97
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,810
how to face her right now.

98
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,570

don't fall in love?

It's just that I'm still contemplating
if I want to get into this.

137
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,760
Has he confessed?

138
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,250
So, he just kissed you

139
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,640
without confessing?

140
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,680
He's hinted at it,

141
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,250

has met her match this time.

you've never been
in a relationship before,

151
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,880
so how are you going
to help me with that?

152
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,330
I've never been in a relationship,

153
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,680
but I've watched a lot of dramas.

154
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,490
According to those dramas,

155
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,040
we have to take things slow and gradual
when it comes to relationships.

156
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,920
Then, why didn't he confess to me?

on the new team members.

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,640

Stop this. Can't you
be more like yourself?

162
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,160
I went back and thought about
that "misattribution of arousal"

163
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,370
you told me about last time.

164
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,760
I've come up with an idea

165
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,490
that can intensify the love between you,

166
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,800

Yes.

That's great.

Think about it, it's dark

171
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,760
and scary in there.

172
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,520
When she gets scared,

173
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,520
she'll run straight to you,

174
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,850
At that moment, you'll hold her

175
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,370
and comfort her slowly.
Then, she'll be all yours, no?

176
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,330
That sounds pretty good, but it's

177
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,560

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,040
of a way to strike back now.

184
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,330
Wait, you're saying
that I've already lost.

185
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,520
What do you mean I've lost?

186
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,090
Anyway, whether you lose or not,

187
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,760
you can't passively sit here right now.

188
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,040
You have to go and ask her out!

189
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,640
How do I do that?

190
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,210
There are a hundred ways
to pursue a girl.

191
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,760
Do I need to teach you that?

192
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,250
The point is, I've never pursued
anyone before.

193
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Girls pursued me instead.

194
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,920
Fine.

195
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,010
You shall sit here and wait

196
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,490
for her to come and pursue you then.

197
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,920
(Polar Night Rescue)

198
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,130
Weiling, I quit.

199
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,920
I heard the team's recruiting
new reserves now.

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,090
I'll quit once they're here.

201
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,560
Why?

202
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,280
This morning, I went
to the neighborhood next door

203
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
to help poke a hornet's nest,

204
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,640
and I chased cats for another
three hours this afternoon.

205
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,490
I didn't join the rescue team
to do all this work.

206
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,210
I don't get paid, so I'm not willing
to lose my money for this.

207
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,400
Have you really thought this through?

208
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,250
By the way, we have a missing dog here.

209
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,280
Well, find it.

210
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,130
Although it's not our duty to find dogs,

211
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,040
I'd rather be doing
this kind of work sometimes.

212
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,370
After all, when we do go out and help,

213
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,970
it's either a natural
or a man-made disaster,

214
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,760
isn't it?

215
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I'll go, since I'm more familiar
with this area.

216
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,160
I can't guarantee I'll find it though.

217
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,640
Hello?

218
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,920
So, you've found it?

219
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,450
Xie Yuan, they've found it!

220
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,680
Sure, bye-bye.

221
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Fine, I'm giving you the day off.

222
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,970
Go back early and rest.
Take a hot shower.

223
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,000
- Really?
- Yes, go.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,910
Bye-bye.

225
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,420
(Stardust Rouge)

226
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,780
(Su Qingche)
(Are you asleep?)

227
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,700
(I was asleep last night, so I didn't
see your message. What's up?)

228
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,490
(I was asleep last night, so I didn't
see your message. What's up?)

229
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,420
(Nothing, I just...)

230
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,640
(Nothing, I just wanted to ask you
what our relationship is now)

231
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,740
(after that kiss last night.)

232
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,980
(Are you free tonight?
Can I take you to dinner?)

233
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,300
(Nothing...)

234
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,540
(Nothing, I just wanted to ask
if you made it home safely.)

235
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,210
(Nothing, I just wanted to ask
if you made it home safely.)

236
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,980
(Voice Call)

237
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,180
(Su Qingche)

238
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,250
Hello?

239
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,490
Well,

240
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,090
last night, Lu Qun told me

241
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,040
that he found

242
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,330
an especially interesting escape room.

243
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,760
So, I'm wondering

244
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,520
if you'd like to go with me?

245
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,560
I'm not really interested
in escape rooms.

246
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,080
(Come on, it's good to relax a little.)

247
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,080
Fine, but I can't make it today.

248
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,730
If today doesn't work, then tomorrow.
If not, then the day after that.

249
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,490
Any day of the week is fine.
It's up to you.

250
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,930
Alright, tomorrow then.

251
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,490
Send me the address.

252
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,080
Okay.

253
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,280
I'll send it to you in a moment.

254
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,360
(See you tomorrow.)

255
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,970
See you.

256
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,840
Aunt.

257
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,040
I have a new professor again

258
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,320
for my elective course, Economics,

259
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,520
who's supposedly a PhD
from the Ivy League.

260
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,930
And for that, I have to start
the course all over again.

261
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,360
It's so annoying.

262
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,120
Well, what's wrong with having
a better mentor?

263
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,450
Oh, right.

264
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,930
Su Qingche said we're going
to an escape room tomorrow.

265
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,690
Do you want to join us?

266
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,650
I invited Xiaoli as well.

267
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,560
He's quite proactive.

268
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,890
I can take this chance
to test him for you.

269
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,360
How are you planning to do that?

270
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,170
Why would a man ask you

271
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,490
to watch a horror film

272
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,280
and play an escape room?

273
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,410
His intentions are obvious.

274
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,690
Hey, you two.

275
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,120
It's past lunchtime now.

276
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,520
- Hurry up and get to work.
- Alright.

277
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,560
What can I do for you, Lu Qun?

278
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,930
I heard you and your friends
own an escape room, right?

279
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,250
That's right. Why?

280
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,690
I'm taking my friends there in two days.

281
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,690
Can you make some arrangements for us?

282
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,930
Sure, no problem.

283
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,890
The only thing that matters

284
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,600
is to ensure that Captain Su

285
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,080
has intimate contact with Xingchen.

286
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,690
- Got it.
- Understood?

287
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,280
Of course.

288
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,870
- Go now.
- Okay.

289
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:41,760
Can you stop

290
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,650
clinging to me like an adhesive plaster?

291
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,730
What a coincidence!

292
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,490
I've also been practicing
my running lately.

293
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,490
By the way,

294
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,360
it actually works.

295
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,490
I can run

296
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,970
5 km in 20 minutes.

297
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,690
Okay,

298
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,120
I'll put it to the test then.

299
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,250
This is simple and not difficult at all.

300
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,170
It's so easy!

301
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,080
Here.

302
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
Don't come down
until you've finished 20 km.

303
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,450
All the best.

304
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,840
Weiling!

305
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,250
You have to wait for me to finish!
You must watch me run.

306
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,280
You're not afraid, right?

307
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,080
(Immersive Escape Room)

308
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,890
Take a guess.

309
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,860
(Xingkong Escape Room)

310
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,930
What do you think?

311
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,940
(Immersive Escape Room)

312
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
Are you sure it'll go according
to what you said

313
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
when we get in there later on?

314
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,650
Don't worry, I've asked Zhou Yao
to arrange it.

315
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,080
This is guaranteed to be
the scariest escape room in town.

316
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm sure it'll scare
Song Xingchen so much

317
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,360
that she'll jump into your arms,

318
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,410
and yell, "Protect me, Qingche!"

319
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:58,840
Go away!

320
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,520
They're here.

321
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,690
Why are you here?

322
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,210
Isn't it more fun to visit
an escape room

323
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,010
with more people?

324
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,690
It won't be too scary, right?

325
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,280
What's so scary about this?

326
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,120
An escape room is all
about completing tasks

327
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,650
given to us by NPC, so calm down.

328
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,320
Don't worry,

329
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,120
I'll protect you.

330
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,690
Captain Su. Xingchen.

331
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,010
Why are you here?

332
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
Today, I'll be in charge
of your escape room journey

333
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,930
instead of my friend.

334
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,450
I'll create the most special

335
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,650
horror journey for you all.

336
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,650
See this basket?

337
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,650
Please put your wallets

338
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,360
and phones in here.

339
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,560
Alright.

340
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,410
Finally,

341
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,650
this is an Immersive Escape Room,

342
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,890
so you have to be immersed in it.

343
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,250
Please come with me

344
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,490
to change into your default outfits.

345
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,110
This way, please.

346
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,020
- I'm kind of scared now.
- Let's go.

347
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,740
(Try hard for college entrance exams.
Strive while we're young.)

348
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,080
Isn't this supposed to be scary?

349
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,080
"Try hard for college entrance exams.
Strive while we're young." Seriously?

350
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Don't worry, it'll definitely be scary.

351
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,120
I can tell that you're
a delinquent student at first sight.

352
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,120
What about you?

353
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,280
A senior who likes little boys?

354
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,080
That's right, I only like good students.

355
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,690
Why? What's your problem?

356
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,250
You better watch out later.

357
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,170
You can sit in the back if you want.

358
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,520
Xingchen and I are already deskmates.

359
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,040
Isn't this a horror escape room?

360
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,930
Why doesn't it seem like that at all?

361
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,560
(Students, the moment you came
into this classroom,)

362
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,890
something horrible happened.

363
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,320
The horrible thing is that you've

364
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,250
time-traveled.

365
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,730
(It's now the night before
your college entrance exam.)

366
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,120
(If you want to escape
from this escape room)

367
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,730
(and come back to the present,)

368
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,520
(the only way)

369
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,560
is to find the paper

370
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,890
for tomorrow's exam

371
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,010
in this school.

372
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,280
Why is this so scary?

373
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,170
They won't make us take the exam, right?

374
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,120
What's wrong with you?

375
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,080
Let's go.

376
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,600
Hurry up and go!
I don't want to be the last one!

377
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,760
Quick!

378
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,040
So, this is what you called

379
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,360
"the scariest escape room in town?"

380
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,250
The best is yet to come.
What's the hurry?

381
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,890
I knew you must be the who came up

382
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,520
with such a terrible idea.

383
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,890
Since we're here to have fun,
let's have a good time.

384
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,080
I don't think it's this simple.

385
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,930
They won't make it easy for us,

386
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,760
even if it's just getting a paper.

387
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,690
Aunt!

388
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,360
What did you call her?

389
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,840
This is my aunt,

390
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,040
the one I grew up with,

391
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,120
the one I'm related to!

392
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,080
Aunt, please don't leave me.

393
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,930
Qian Cheng, you're so embarrassing,

394
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,280
and you'd only call me "Aunt"
during moments like this.

395
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,690
Haven't you done any background check?

396
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,970
Did you hear that sound just now?

397
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,210
Who'd have thought she'd have such

398
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,010
an old nephew?

399
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,040
Fine, you were jealous for nothing.

400
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,940
Aunt!

401
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,760
(I forgot to tell you all)

402
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,450
(that this school is patrolled
by security guards at night.)

403
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,120
(If the security guards catch you,)

404
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,970
(it won't be as simple)

405
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,490
(as just locking you up.)

406
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,690
Aunt!

407
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,650
Let's split up.

408
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,970
Run!

409
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,360
Hurry up and run!

410
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,560
Hurry up!

411
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,800
This way!

412
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:47,890
Over here!

413
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,560
Hold on!

414
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,450
Are they both okay out there?

415
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,800
It's okay, Qingche is there.
They'll be fine.

416
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,650
I'm so scared.

417
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,010
Where are they?

418
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Help me, Aunt!

419
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,690
That surprised me.

420
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,490
Don't get me wrong.

421
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,930
I was just using you
for my own protection.

422
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,120
It's fine.

423
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,690
If you're really scared,

424
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,890
you can hold on to my arm.

425
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,650
No, thanks.

426
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,970
Help!

427
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,010
Aunt!

428
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,040
Say, won't that guy keep chasing
after Qian Cheng

429
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,970
if he screams so loudly?

430
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,650
He's young,

431
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,560
so he should experience it.

432
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,040
Let him get some training,

433
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,080
and both of us will be safe.

434
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,040
That makes sense.

435
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,360
That kid

436
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,520
should get some experience.

437
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,280
Exactly.

438
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,250
(Welcome to the art studio.)

439
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,360
(All the secrets of this place
are hidden in these paintings.)

440
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,650
(All you have to do
is look through these paintings)

441
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,170
(and find the answers I want,)

442
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
(in order to pass this level.)

443
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,690
(Good luck cracking it, you two.)

444
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,890
Just now, he said the clues
are in the paintings here.

445
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,280
The paintings here

446
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,520
consist of only fruits,

447
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,040
flowers, and landscapes.

448
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,890
I have an idea.

449
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,890
Should we

450
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,280
press both the flowers here?

451
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,460
(Female Senior)

452
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,250
Captain Su.

453
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,250
This painting says "Female Senior",

454
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,250
while this one says "Male Senior".

455
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,320
Could it be that the male

456
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,690
should press

457
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,170
the flowers,

458
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,450
while the female presses the fruits?

459
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,690
Let's try it.

460
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,340
(Camera04)

461
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,280
Try pressing the flowers.

462
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,450
Are you nervous?

463
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
No.

464
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,080
Whose idea was it to visit
this escape room today?

465
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,650
Lu Qun's.

466
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,520
Did you assume Qian Cheng
was your love rival?

467
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,080
So, what's our relationship now?

468
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,730
Teammates?

469
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,280
Friends?

470
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,170
But, you didn't push me away that day.

471
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,650
Is that what friends do?

472
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,320
It was only fair
to the beautiful scenery

473
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,690
to have a kiss, since the atmosphere
was right, no?

474
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,490
Does it have anything to do
with the atmosphere and scenery?

475
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,560
Does it not?

476
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,320
What do you think
of the atmosphere now then?

477
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,280
Let's go.

478
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,010
Help!

479
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,210
Aunt!

480
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,170
Aunt!

481
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,930
What are you doing?

482
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,410
Don't go after the two men
and one woman!

483
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,010
What's wrong with you?

484
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,890
Go after that one man and one woman!

485
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,080
Boss!

486
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,560
I've been going round and round

487
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,080
since he brought me in here!

488
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,120
He's not solving the puzzle too,

489
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,250
so the door won't open,

490
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,170
and I can't get out!

491
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,840
Mom!

492
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,450
Stop right there!

493
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,730
(It looks like I have to find a way
to spice things up for him.)

494
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,970
This place looks
as if it's your home turf.

495
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,040
Let's just look for the clues first.

496
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,210
Isn't this a clue?

497
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,120
It's all written here.

498
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,890
But, I don't know what's in front of it.

499
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,890
Water.

500
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,120
There are no such chemicals here.

501
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,490
However, if we combine these elements...

502
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,890
Tears.

503
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,490
What?

504
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,450
We need to shed tears.

505
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,320
This is easy.

506
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,970
Here.

507
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,280
How is that possible?

508
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,690
Haven't you heard

509
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,930
that it's natural for women to cry?

510
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,970
Can you do it?

511
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,560
No.

512
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,890
How can a man say no so easily?

513
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,890
No means no.

514
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,040
I can't do it even if you hit me.

515
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,560
Keep your eyes on me. Don't blink.

516
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,650
They say

517
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,080
if you look into each other's eyes
for more than 10 seconds,

518
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
you'll fall in love.

519
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,360
It's all a lie.

520
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,450
There's no medical evidence for it.

521
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,840
Mission accomplished.

522
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,730
Let's go.

523
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,490
Why can't we find that paper yet?

524
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,250
It's probably up ahead.

525
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,080
Aunt!

526
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,010
This way!

527
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,010
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

528
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,410
Come on.

529
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,010
It's the paper!

530
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,080
Why are you running away from us?

531
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,890
We've got the paper.

532
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,320
Wait a minute!

533
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,360
(Congratulations!)

534
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,690
(Congratulations on escaping the patrol)

535
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,890
(and finding the papers,)

536
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,360
but there's one last challenge
that you must face.

537
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,080
(What is it?)

538
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,650
The first

539
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,170
man and woman to find the paper

540
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,250
need to kiss for ten seconds
in front of the camera,

541
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,080
(in order to disarm the mechanism.)

542
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,520
No way! There's something wrong
with this game's configuration!

543
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,120
Agreed!

544
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,930
What does getting a paper
have to do with kissing?

545
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,040
Since we're all here to play,

546
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,810
we have to play by the rules.

547
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,560
No, I don't think that's
a good idea either.

548
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,040
If we play a game,
we should follow its rules, no?

549
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,450
Either that, or no one escapes.

550
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,680
How about we use
the forced perspective technique?

551
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,490
That's doable though.

552
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,850
So if we don't kiss,

553
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,080
you won't let us out, right?

554
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,770
(Congratulations.)

555
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,890
(That's correct.)

556
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,640
Come on.

557
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,080
Use the forced perspective technique.

558
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,810
That's enough! Time's up.

559
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,850
Let go of my aunt.

560
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,560
Was that okay?

561
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
I'm sorry,

562
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,680
I forgot to turn on the timer just now.

563
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,160
(Go on, you two.)

564
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,680
Hold on,

565
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,450
are you being paid to do this?

566
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,450

Xiaoli,

575
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,200
since we both comrades in arms now,

576
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,370
let's add each other on WeChat.

577
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,450
I'm not sure about comrades,

578
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,560
but we do need a packer at the store.

579
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,290
Sure, call me if you need anything.

580
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,330
I've added you.

581
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,720
Since we had so much fun today,
let's all have dinner together.

582
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,970
We'll pass.

583
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,640
We have to go back to the store
and do some inventory.

584
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,490
Let's go.

585
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,240
Wait up!

586
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,890
Aunt!

587
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,080
She's gone, so stop staring. By the way,

588
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,240
you're a pretty good kisser.

589
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,290
Not bad. How much was it?

590
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,560
How was it? It was a good
arrangement today, right?

591
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,330
I've been watching you two today.
You two are fine.

592
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,930
But, we also kissed last time.

593
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,450
It was because of the atmosphere
last time.

594
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,450
But it was a real kiss this time,

595
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,200
and you both did it
in front of the three of us.

596
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
Essentially, is there a difference?

597
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,200
One is active, and one is passive.

598
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,290
What do you think?

599
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,890
When will our relationship start though?

600
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,120
Generally speaking,

601
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,410
in cases like this, I'm already

602
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,890
considered her boyfriend, right?

603
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,290
Have you not confessed to her?

604
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,160
I haven't.

605
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,520
But what more do I need to say,

606
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,160
when our actions have spoken
louder than words?

607
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,640
All girls need a sense of ceremony.

608
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,040
You must tell her,

609
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,330
"I like you, and I want to be with you."

610
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,490
That's how it works.

611
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,010
So, it's as simple
and straightforward as that?

612
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,290
If you don't do it,

613
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,160
we're doing all this for nothing,

614
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,850
you know?

615
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,850
Of course I'll be there
for the all-girl party.

616
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
Sorry, I have somewhere to be now.

617
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,290
Hurry up and confess to her soon.

618
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,290
Be wise about it.

619
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,850
Just look at you.

620
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,770
Have you fallen head over heels for him?

621
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,040
Well, just laugh all you want at me.

622
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,890
Quick, tell me

623
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,450
what happened between you two

624
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,490
when you were away from me today.

625
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,680
Has he confessed?

626
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,520
Not yet.

627
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,450
How come?

628
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,560
I've told him my answer today.

(Let me know when you get home.)

630

631
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,300
(Okay.)

632
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,120
(Haicheng TAXI)
Okay, I'll leave you two to it.

633
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,080
- Sir, stop at the intersection ahead.
- Sure.

634
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,520
Why? Where are you going?

635
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,330
I'm attending a reunion party.

636
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,490
Fine, don't stay out too late then.

637
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,490
I'll wait for you
to warm my bed tonight.

638
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,930
Yes, my lady.

640
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,680
Lu, over here!

641
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,890
You're here early today.

642
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,850
Yes, I don't want to keep you waiting.

643
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,560
Okay, well done. Drink more today.

644
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,850
I thought

645
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,890
you were going to go out
with that pretty lady.

646
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,520
I'm only interested
in stunning beauties.

647
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,640
For instance, someone like Ms. Song.

648
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
However, she belongs to Captain Su.

649
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,890
I befriended your friend,
Nana, just now.

650
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,160
She said a few young actresses
will attend as well tonight.

651
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,290
You've been single for two months.
This is not good.

652
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,970
You can't keep focusing

653
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,290
on Captain Su's personal problems,

654
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,080
am I right?

655
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,680
I'm still recovering
from my previous heartbreak.

656
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,080
I'm just here to have some fun.
Let's go.

657
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,890
Okay then.

658
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,010
I'm late, everybody.

659
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,160
I'm so sorry.

660
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,330
If it isn't our busy man, Captain Lu.

661
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,330
You're finally free to drop by today.

662
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,290
Of course.

663
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,770
He's doing it for the sake
of Nana after all.

664
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,520
Come on, that's ridiculous.

665
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,370
Lu is actually craving for alcohol,

666
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,640
so he's here for the drink.

667
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,520
I'm late, so my friend and I
shall drink to everyone!

668
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,640
Come on,

669
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,450

Guys,

673
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,120
- Something's up, so I have to go now.
- Why don't you stay a little longer?

674
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
I've got some work to do.
Let's meet again next time.

675
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,520
See you all next time.

676
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,450

Don't get me wrong.

It's fine.

684
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,080
If you're really scared,

685
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,640
you can hold on to my arm.

686
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,450
Don't be angry, Nana.

687
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,370
I was just being nice
to some new friends.

688
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,520
That won't do.

689
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,600
You have

690
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,970
so many confidantes.

691
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,680
I can't believe he has the mood

692
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,080
to flirt here right after we were done.

693
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,080
Unbelievable!

694
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,370
That's not it.

695
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,890
You and I are definitely the closest.

696
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,120
- He's indeed a player.
- I'm leaving now.

697
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,080
How about I give you a ride?

698
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,600
- I even thought he was manly
- It's so late now.

699
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,160
- when we were in the escape room today.
- I shouldn't let you go home alone.

700
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,770
Let me send you back.

701
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,560
Whatever!

702
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,770
What are you trying to do?

703
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,410
Nothing.

00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,890
