One, one, two.

Cancel.

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,200
How am I supposed to code this?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
Cancel.

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,679
Xie Yuan, are you there?

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,920
I need help.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,560
Yeah?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,320
How am I supposed to code a specific
frequency into the walkie-talkie?

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,319
Radio waves are so complicated.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm not a programmer.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm trying to make sense of it too.

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,359
Why would they ask me,
a business correspondent,

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,920
to handle this?

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
We're in the same boat.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
I guess we are not sleeping tonight.

40
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
We don't know anything
and we're too scared to ask.

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
This task is downright inhumane.

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,799
(I'm sick of his poker face.)

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,159
(Our training is already tough enough.)

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,039
(Why can't he give us a friendly smile)

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,520
(and treat us nicely?)

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
Dr. Song, I applaud your candor.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,320
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,439
Am I wrong though?

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,279
Don't you agree?

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,640
I agree.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,079
I bet this is why

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,520
he's single.

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Xinyu, how come you are on this channel?

54
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,279
It's a public channel.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,160
Anyone can tune in to it.

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm here too.

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Me too.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
Captain Lu.

59
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,039
Don't snitch us out, please.

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,920
Those are hurtful words, Xie Yuan.

61
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,400
(Am I a tattertale?)

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
(But I do think you're right.)

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,279
There must be a reason why Qingche

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,480
can't find a girlfriend.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,080
(However, Dr. Song,)

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,639
you grouped Qingche and Xie Yuan up

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,119
for the mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation exercise.

68
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,080
It sounds iffy.

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,440
Why not?

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,120
You don't see the problem at all,
Song Xingchen?

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,919
If you have any criticisms,

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
you can bring them up to me.

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,040
Also,

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,600
practice makes perfect.

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,319
(Head to the warehouse tomorrow morning)

76
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
to clean all walkie-talkies

77
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,440
and tune them properly.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,919
Captain Su.

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,039
I think the punishment
is disproportionate.

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,840
I didn't say anything outrageous. Right?

81
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,159
How old is he again?

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,479
Why is he still so petty?

83
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,680
I can't believe it.

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,040
He's an adult.

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,360
Why is he so petty?

86
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
Very petty.

87
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,599
Depending on the person,
I can be generous too.

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,520
Are you done cursing at me?

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,279
Why are you here?

90
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm here to check on your progress.

91
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,879
I thought I could help
reduce your workload

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,240
but it seems like...

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,439
Quit acting nice.

94
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,599
If I can't master this,

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
it's because you're a bad teacher.

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,119
So you haven't learned
your lesson at all.

97
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,320
And you can't take any feedback at all.

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,160
Constructive criticisms,
ever heard of it?

99
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,039
I don't take criticism from everybody.

100
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,360
Also, of all the people here,
why should I listen to you?

101
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,919
Why are you all disciplined and whatnot

102
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,919
in front of everyone,

103
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,599
but you treat me differently?

104
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,759
Because everyone

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,119
works differently

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,719
and you require this approach from me.

107
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,360
No, you're doing this on purpose.

108
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,079
A student is as good as their tutor.

109
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,559
There are no dumb students.

110
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
Only bad teachers.

111
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm done cleaning.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,719
Don't forget your CPR training
this afternoon.

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,440
Bye.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,840
Straighten your arm.

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,639
To treat deltoid muscle injury,
you need dressing,

116
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,839
a splint, and a tourniquet.

117
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
That's all.

118
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,039
I would like to take leave
to rest a bit.

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,960
Okay.

120
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:10,140
(Female Bathroom
Availability: 7 AM to 10 PM)

121
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Are you okay?

122
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm fine.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Captain Su,

124
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,200
can you make an exception?

125
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,639
Can I use the bathroom for 10 minutes?

126
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,319
It's past ten now so by right,

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,200
you can't use it.

128
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
Come earlier tomorrow.

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,359
So no?

130
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,840
No.

131
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,880
Never mind then.

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,320
(What medicine do girls take
when it's their time of the month?)

133
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,719
(Cadet Dormitory)
Who's there?

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
It's me, Captain Su.

135
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,640
Uhm.

136
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,720
I hope I bought enough.

137
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
Here you go.

138
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,720
Come to me if you need more.

139
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,560
Why so nice all of a sudden?

140
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,480
And you even know what to buy.

141
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,279
I can't make an exception
and extend the bathroom's availability.

142
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,600
But yours is a special case.

143
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,560
What?

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm thinking

145
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,920
that maybe you aren't
as bad as I thought.

146
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,080
Well, thank you.

147
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,640
Rest early.

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,080
And you're exempted from
the morning run tomorrow.

149
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,880
Rest now.

150
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,080
Keep it up.

151
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,120
When did Song Xingchen come?

152
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,439
She was the first to arrive.

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
She has been jogging for half an hour.

154
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,640
How long is it?

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm so tired.

156
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,199
You were exempted.

157
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
Why did you attend the training then?

158
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,440
It's fine.
Jogging is good for your health.

159
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,619
Can you handle
the afternoon training then?

160
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,279
I'm on my period but that doesn't mean
you should cut me some slack.

161
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,160
Warm water?

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,240
Thanks.

163
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,519
We have a 30km military
cross-country running tomorrow.

164
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,440
I know.

165
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,160
It's on the training agenda.

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,760
You might need this.

167
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,840
Captain Su.

168
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,959
Judging from your behavior lately,

169
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,000
I have reasons to think
that you care a lot about me.

170
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,280
I care a lot about the first-aid tutor
in my team.

171
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,570
30km military cross-country running

172
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,999
is your last group activity

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
in this training camp.

174
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,999
It's a challenge that puts

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,039
your will to the test

176
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,920
and evaluates if you have learned
anything here.

177
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,719
Can you do it?

178
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,840
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,240
Turn left!

180
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
Start!

181
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,799
(30km Cross-Country Running Plan)
We're at A66.

182
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,959
We'll go through C39, C10

183
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,680
until we reach the slope at C28.

184
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,920
It has a complicated topography

185
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,220
so be careful.

186
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,410
The sky is cloudy. It looks like
it might rain soon.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,559
You two will scout the path before us.

188
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,400
Okay.

189
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,039
Lu Qun, tell everyone to get ready

190
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,919
to leave.

191
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,640
Yes, sir.

192
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Attention! Get ready to leave.

193
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,759
Leave it be for the moment.

194
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,200
Pack up now.

195
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,720
Don't leave any trash.

196
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,590
Come.

197
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,680
Lin Mu, come.

198
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,959
Yes, Captain Lu.

199
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,000
Safety first. Let's go.

200
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,040
Cling to the robe.
Watch where you're going.

201
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,480
Captain Su, it's clear now.

202
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,960
Grab tight.

203
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,600
Are your feet okay?

204
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,360
Yes. Thank you.

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Grab tight.

206
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,160
Careful. Falling rocks.

207
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,280
What's the status?

208
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,359
Is anyone hurt?

209
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm fine. Let's continue.

210
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,759
Please be extra careful now.

211
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,440
Beware of falling rocks.

212
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,240
Come.

213
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,240
It's a bit swollen.

214
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,359
We need to return to the camp
to see if it's fractured.

215
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,079
No need.

216
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,039
Hand me the splint and the medical kit.

217
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,520
Okay.

218
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,120
Here's the splint.

219
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,760
Can you be serious?

220
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,960
There's mud on your face.

221
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,680
I can only secure the wound like this.

222
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360
We need to send him back for the x-ray.

223
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,079
Okay.

224
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,199
I'm fine. I can keep going.

225
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
This is non-negotiable.

226
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,720
You're heading back.

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,520
Thanks, Dr. Song.

228
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,480
Get up.

229
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
Come.

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,240
Lin Mu, you'll continue
with everyone else.

231
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,719
Yes, sir.

232
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,799
Continue!

233
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,239
Don't worry. I'm fine.

234
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,599
I know. Go now.

235
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,559
Apply an ice pack too.

236
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,440
Or it'll continue to swell.

237
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,319
Let's go.

238
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,240
Be careful.

239
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,640
I can't believe you stick with us
till the end, Dr. Song.

240
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,519
I thought a pretty girl like you

241
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,640
would complain.

242
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,040
Just call me Xingchen.

243
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,760
Keep it up, guys.

244
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,680
We will arrive at the resting area soon.

245
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
Keep up now.

246
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,479
Xingchen,

247
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,400
have you seen Liu Xinyu?

248
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,919
She was behind me

249
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,159
and now, she's gone.

250
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,800
Did she fail to keep up?

251
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,560
It's okay. I'll look for her.

252
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,679
I'll catch up to you in no time.

253
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Go first.

254
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,239
(Emergency)

255
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
How long has it been now?
The x-ray should be out by now.

256
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,720
When it's out,
the doctor will let me know.

257
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,720
I have a feeling that it will rain soon.

258
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,040
I told you so.

259
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,519
But don't worry.

260
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,799
Lin Mu and Weiling are there.

261
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,920
Nothing bad will happen.

262
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
Can you check if the result is out?

263
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
Xinyu.

264
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,160
Why are you here?

265
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,840
I'm exhausted

266
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,239
so I sit down to rest a bit.

267
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,039
We need to catch up to them now.

268
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,319
It's dangerous when you're lost

269
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,760
in the mountains.

270
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,960
- Okay.
- Let's go now.

271
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,040
Weiling, two persons are missing.

272
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:41,999
How come?

273
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,759
Liu Xinyu couldn't keep up

274
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,240
so Xingchen went to find her.

275
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,600
Who said they could leave the party?

276
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,679
You saw it so why didn't you tell me?

277
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,039
I... I...

278
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,880
It's fine.

279
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,079
Bring the others with you.

280
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,880
I'll take two with me to check on them.

281
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,079
Okay.

282
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,240
Everyone, come with me.

283
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,600
Safety first.

284
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,319
Quit nagging.

285
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,799
Stay in formation. March!

286
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,080
- Come.
- Keep up.

287
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,320
Hurry.

288
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's go.

289
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,640
No fracture at all.

290
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,799
Yes.

291
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,999
Thank goodness for the cushion.

292
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,360
Otherwise, your bone will be fractured.

293
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,719
I told you I'm fine.

294
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Sheesh.
Do you have a metal leg or something?

295
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,159
Please be mindful

296
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,239
of this spot here.

297
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,959
Yes? What's up?

298
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Avoid physical activity.

299
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,080
Captain Lu, two cadets went missing.

300
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,359
What? Two went missing? Who?

301
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,800
Get more people and search for them.

302
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,600
Who went missing?

303
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,600
I don't know yet.

304
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,560
Give it to me.

305
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What's the situation?

306
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,560
Be honest.

307
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,270
Someone fell behind. Dr. Song went
looking for her and was separated from us.

308
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,639
I sent two men to look for her now.

309
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
Things will be bad when it turns dark.

310
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,960
Qingche.

311
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,599
You're wounded.

312
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,439
Don't go.

313
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,680
You're injured.

314
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Don't go.

315
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,880
Qingche.

316
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,600
Oh, no, Xingchen.

317
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,439
We've been walking for a while now
and we haven't seen anyone.

318
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,080
Are we lost?

319
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,520
It's okay. I'm here.

320
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,640
Let's leave a mark here.

321
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,599
When they notice that we're missing,

322
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,159
they'll send someone to look for us.

323
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,280
The mark will lead them to us.

324
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,440
Let's mark this place.

325
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Xingchen!

326
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,800
Xingchen!

327
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,480
Xingchen, are you okay?

328
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Xingchen, can you hear me?

329
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Xinyu.

330
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,479
Xinyu, calm down.

331
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,560
Listen to me.

332
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,759
Head southwest to descend
from the mountain.

333
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,999
Reunite with the party

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,439
and tell them I'm here.

335
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,599
Do you hear me?

336
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
Okay. Wait for me here.

337
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,039
Guys, according to the weather forecast,

338
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,259
there will be a thunderstorm tonight.

339
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,720
You must act in groups.

340
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,960
Yes, sir.

341
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,000
Over here.

342
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,199
Dr. Song!

343
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,480
- Liu Xinyu.
- Dr. Song.

344
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,960
Song Xingchen!

345
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,240
Song Xingchen!

346
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,240
Song Xingchen!

347
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,360
Song Xingchen.

348
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Su Qingche?

349
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,240
How come you are here?

350
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,080
You're not supposed to walk around.

351
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,159
I'm fine.

352
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,720
Wait for me. I'm coming down now.

353
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,360
Song Xingchen.

354
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,640
Song Xingchen.

355
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,919
- Liu Xinyu.
- Dr. Song.

356
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,560
- Dr. Song.
- Dr. Song.

357
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,599
How is your leg? Are you okay?

358
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,920
I'm fine. How are you?

359
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
I'm fine.

360
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,879
Did you get the x-ray?

361
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,799
What did the doctor say?

362
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Yes. The doctor said that
there was no bone fracture.

363
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,400
Where is Liu Xinyu?

364
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Liu Xinyu.

365
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,759
Liu Xinyu.

366
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm here. I'm here.

367
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
Are you all right?

368
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,800
Where is Xingchen?

369
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,119
She fell down.

370
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,519
What? Where?

371
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,119
She's...

372
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,519
She fell...

373
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,600
Lu Qun.

374
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,639
Liu Xinyu heads southwest

375
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,959
to get down from the mountain.

376
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,520
Find her along that area.

377
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,559
Liu Xinyu is with me now.

378
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,599
Xingchen fell down a slope.

379
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,280
But I don't know where she is.
What do we do?

380
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,639
Song Xingchen is with me. She's safe.

381
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,679
We will

382
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,719
find a shelter nearby.

383
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
We'll let you know once we're safe.

384
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,200
Okay.

385
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,519
You two, bring her back now.

386
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,920
- Yes, sir.
- Quick.

387
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,000
Come.

388
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,640
Are you okay?

389
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,480
Lin Mu, come with me
to look for Qingche.

390
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,560
All right. Let's go.

391
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,359
You're injured. Why force yourself?

392
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,040
You should have sent someone else here.

393
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,039
One of my guys went missing.

394
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,520
So I have to come back.

395
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,160

396
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,600

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Liar.

400
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,800
- It's raining.
- We have to go.

401

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,040
it will be a shop
selling feminine products.

479
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,560
I want to use Polar Night

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,279
to show everyone a more professional

481
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,920

483
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,720

you find any dates then?

485
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,720

492
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,999
I found the knife and saw

493
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,880
the mark you left on the tree.

494
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,879

Stay put. Don't blow your cover.

500
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,520
I finally found someone
to look after you.

501
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,839
But I'm healed now.

502
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,040
What did I tell you?

503
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,319
Faking vulnerability is a good tactic.

504
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,599
What? Pretending to be in pain

505
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,399
is a tactic now?

506
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,240
Of course.

507
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,559
Why do you think

508
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,599
Dr. Song tends

509
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,680
to you this frequently?

510
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,720
It means

511
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,960
she has enough rest?

512
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,440
No!

513
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,359
It means your hero-in-distress

514
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,080
act is working.

515
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,199
So stay here

516
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,000
and enjoy it. All right?

517
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,840
You're not wrong.

518
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,560
She does visit me often lately.

519
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,400
I quite like that.

520
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,160
Have you experienced this before?

521
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,480
Qingche.

522
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,400
You've changed.

523
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,440
Your good conscience is blinded
by a beauty.

524
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,840
Tell me.

525
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,040
Do you think she's into me?

526
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,880
So you're smitten.

527
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
Let me break this down to you.

528
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,439
During the training these few days,

529
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,279
you two were at each other's

530
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,400
throat.

531
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,919
At most, she feels

532
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,919
a sense of gratitude and guilt
toward you.

533
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,280
If she likes you because of that,

534
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,290
she must have a serious case of
Stockholm syndrome.

535
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
Are you done with the training report?

536
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,960
Should I add another 10,000 words?

537
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,919
Maybe I have Stockholm syndrome too.

538
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,240
You always do this.

539
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,879
Tell me.

540
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,159
Did you two do anything

541
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,919
in that small hut?

542
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,639
Give me a break.

543
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,719
What exactly do you want to know?

544
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,159
It was the perfect opportunity.
And nothing happened between you two?

545
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,600
It's a hut.

546
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,160
Nothing happens there.

547
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,360
It must be
the misattribution of arousal.

548
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,880
Misattribution of arousal.

549
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,710
Misattribution of arousal?

550
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,920
Yes.

551
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,039
Misattribution of arousal

552
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,679
states that when someone

553
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,039
experiences fear,

554
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,079
their heartbeat will rise.

555
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,479
And when they meet

556
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,920
another person in this state,

557
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,559
they will misinterpret

558
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,039
this rise in heartbeat

559
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,600
as infatuation or arousal.

560
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,079
So Captain Su made you feel...

561
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm doing some revision in psychology.

562
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,080
I see.

563
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,799
You added a lot of nutrients here.
Will they be too much?

564
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,720
No.

565
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,720
Captain Su is seriously ill.

566
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,120
Normally,

567
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,839
when we experience an emotion,

568
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,440
it manifests itself in two stages.

569
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,879
A rise in body temperature
and a rise in heartbeat.

570
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,759
We then rationalize

571
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,159
our emotion

572
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,200
by using our surroundings.

573
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,200
Eating something when you're starving

574
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,480
and having a crush on somebody

575
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,880
are the same emotion

576
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,359
for the human brain.

577
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,239
Cut to the chase.

578
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,639
It's just
the two-factor theory of emotion.

579
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,880
You could've told me right away.

580
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,319
You two were in

581
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,519
a perilous situation.

582
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,399
And you just fed her.

583
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,839
Naturally,

584
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,079
she felt safe and reassured around you.

585
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,519
But knowing this theory is no use.

586
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,800
You have to use it.

587
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,639
I'm trying to impress her.

588
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,360
I don't need to manipulate her.
Why should I use psychological tricks?

589
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,199
My friend.

590
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,839
Getting a girlfriend isn't easy at all.

591
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,600
Oh, grilling sweet potatoes...

592
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,559
Lie down. She's here.

593
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Fake it.

594
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,959
Dr. Song, you're here.

595
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,280
Did I interrupt something?

596
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,439
You brought food.

597
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,960
Enjoy the food them.
Don't let me keep you.

598
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,560
Have some soup.

599
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,720
This soup again?

600
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,719
I added a lot of Chinese herbs to it.

601
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,440
It will speed up your recovery.

602
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,600
Come.

603
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,280
Does your leg still hurt?

604
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,520
I feel much better.

605
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,000
Do you like it?

606
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,320
Can I add you on WeChat?

607
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,560
Uhm.

608
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
Why?

609
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,520
You can contact me on Wangwang
if you need to file an insurance claim.

610
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,730
We know each other for a while now.

611
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,680
We should add each other on WeChat.

612
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,659
(Song Xingchen, Add To Contact)

613
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,210
(I'm Su Qingche.)

614
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,260
(Su Qingche, Approve)

615
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,399
What if I block you after I leave

616
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,440
this ward?

617
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Try me.

618
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,760
I'll block you when you piss me off.

619
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,040
Drink the soup. I should go now.

620
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,999
Moisturizing and brightening.

621
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,160
Plant extracts for a natural approach.

622
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,519
Sakura Silk Lotion

623
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,960
will protect your flawless skin.

624
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,399
Cut.

625
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,120
Good. Well done.

626
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,000
Get changed. Be ready for the next set.

627
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,560
Qingyin.

628
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,399
Their previous models had to shoot

629
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
several takes to say their line

630
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,200
but you did it in one take.
You're awesome.

631
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,960
Careful.

632
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,120
My phone.

633
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,120
Anyone called or texted me?

634
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,000
Yes.

635
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,399
But they are not from Qingche.

636
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,480
The good thing is they asked
for your availability.

637
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,639
(Moments)

638
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,410
(Polar Night Rescue)

639
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,000
Hello?

640
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,480
Hi, Qingche.

641
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,519
Are you all right?

642
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,799
I called Lu Qun

643
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,120
and he told me you went to rescue
someone in the mountains at night.

644
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,959
Are you hurt?

645
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I'm fine.

646
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,040
By the way, I'm coming back
in a few days.

647
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,759
Do you want me to get you anything?

648
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,200
No need. Thanks.

649
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,119
I knew you would say that.

650
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,719
So I already bought something for you.

651
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,159
It's a necktie.

652
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,959
Qingyin.

653
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,160
Get changed.

654
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
- Get ready for the next set.
- ll right.

655
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,170
Qingche, I have to go now.

656
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,519
Can you cook chili grilled fish for me
when I'm back?

657
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,560
(See you.)

658
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,440
Qingyin, let's get changed.

659
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,440
Come.

660
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,320
(Captain Su,)

661
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,400
(we had an earthquake here.)

662
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,919
(Around 500 victims are affected
on this island,)

663
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,400
(including 30 Chinese tourists.)

664
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,480
(And many more are injured.)

665
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,800
(We need a professional
rescue team here.)

666
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,640
(We need you.)

667
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,600
I see. Prioritize your safety now.

668
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,960
My teammates from various regions
are heading to the airport.

669
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,279
We will be there on time.

670
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,520
(Thank you.)

671
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,720
Which flight do I reserve?

672
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,119
The next one.

673
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,640
Okay. I'll give you a lift.

674
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,080
Wait.

675
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,400
Put this in the jeep first.

676
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,120
Where are you going?

677
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,120
(Polar Night Rescue)
Hi, Dr. Song.

678
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Dr. Song.

679
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,200
Song Xingchen?

680
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
He left without saying goodbye.

681
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,730
(Song Xingchen)

682
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,359
My dear Captain Su,

683
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,120
it isn't fun to be fooled around.

684
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,600
Come now. The plane won't wait for you.

685
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,899
Let me send a text.

686
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,879
We're going now.

687
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,600
Text her when you're there. Come.

688
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,559
Hurry up.

689
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
You can talk to her when you're back.
Come now.

690
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,879
(I got an emergency rescue mission.
Wanted to tell you but you were gone.)

691
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,020
(Incoming Call From Charlie)

692
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,760
Charlie.

693
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,640
(Su)

694
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,520
(Let me brief you about
the situation here.)

695
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,960
Do you have a power bank?

696
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,720
No.

697
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,080
We can rent one at the airport.

698
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,960
Continue, please.

699
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,999
Don't scroll away.

700
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,799
Xinyu, you're here.

701
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,919
Xingchen!

702
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,759
I'm leaving soon.

703
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
Let's add each other on WeChat.

704
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,600
- Sure. Give me a second.
- Okay.

705
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,400
(Su Qingche: You there?
Missed Call From Captain Su)

706
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,400
(You there?)

707
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Who even texts anyone at this
day and age anymore?

708
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,240
You could have told me where you

709
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
are going and when you're coming back.

710
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,599
I promised to buy you a meal.

711
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,080
Pick a meal and time.

712
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,720
(International Departure)
The situation is clear.

713
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,399
Prepare the rescue equipment.

714
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,920
We're going to start working
after arriving.

715
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,760
Any other questions?

716
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,720
My phone died.

717
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,639
Go now.

718
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,719
You haven't checked in. Go.

719
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,719
Lu Qun, when you're back,

720
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,799
update my grandfather about this.

721
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
I don't want him to get worried.

722
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,440
Also,

723
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,119
tell Song Xingchen too.

724
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,319
All right. Go now.

725
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,480
I'm not done yet.

726
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,479
I already planned

727
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,359
for the troop's withdrawal.

728
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,399
Let me know if there's anything.

729
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,559
All right. Go.

730
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,920
You're running out of time.

731
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,320
Run.

732
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,920
Take care.

733
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,670
(Lu Qun, when do you want
to hang out with us?)

734
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,319
I'm not one to make my girls wait.

735
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,440
See you tonight.

736
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,959
Zhou Yao, there's a gathering tonight.

737
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,120
Come with me.

738
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,880
Wait.

739
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,920
Who did Qingche ask me
to update just now?

740
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,400
Oh, his grandfather.

741
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,070
(Colonel)

742
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,080
Sir, it's me, Lu Qun.

743
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,600
Yes, it's me.

744
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,159
Qingche has a mission abroad
for two days.

745
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,079
He told you not to miss him.

746
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,280
He'll come back after two days.

747
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,040
Yes, he'll visit you after two days.

748
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,159
Don't worry.

749
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,280
No problem at all.

750
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,120
I see. Okay.

751
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,069
Bye, sir.

752
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:40,060
(International Departure)

753
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,479
Xingchen.

754
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,839
We'll be on the same team from now on.

755
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,999
We'll definitely have amazing teamwork.

756
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,040
Of course.

757
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,599
My company told me

758
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,640
that I'd work on international flights.

759
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,319
I'm afraid I won't be able

760
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,640
to hang out with you guys anymore.

761
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,840
It's okay.

762
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,560
We learned a lot from this program.

763
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,519
I'm sure we're more experienced

764
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,160
when we encounter any problems
in the future.

765
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,080
You're right.

766
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,880
- We'll get going then.
- Okay.

767
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

768
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,800
Xingchen.

769
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Xingchen.

770
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,719
Sorry, Xingchen.

771
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,719
It was my fault last time.

772
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,280
I shouldn't have left
the party on my own.

773
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,920
It's okay. No need to apologize to me.

774
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,359
I believe

775
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,399
that everyone needs to be

776
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,440
very clear about
the role they play in a rescue mission.

777
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,480
But of course,

778
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,479
I do think that you did well.

779
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,360
So keep it up.

780
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,679
Okay.

781
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,840
Can I have a hug, Xingchen?

782
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,559
Bye, Xingchen.

783
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,520
