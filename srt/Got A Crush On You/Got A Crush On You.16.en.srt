(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,980
(Congrats to Weiling on her one-year
anniversary with the team)

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,140
This celebration party is not bad.

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,300
Qingche is not here. I arranged it.

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,540
Everyone knows how to talk.

29
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,740
You two are here.

30
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,010
Xiaoli, you look so beautiful today.

31
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,420
Congratulations, Weiling.

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,940
- Here, this is from me.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,920
I just wanted to find an opportunity
for everyone to get together.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,900
Why did you buy gifts?

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,900
You're welcome. It's necessary.

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,500
Is everyone here?

37
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,060
Lin Mu and Xie Yuan are inside.

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,900
I'll call them.

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,220
Okay.

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,470
Then let's sit first.

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,840
Okay.

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,020
Are you ready?

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,740
Three, two, one.

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,220
How is it?

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
Will this work?

46
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,580
Why not?

47
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,540
After a little drink later,

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,420
I'll call her over like I did to you

49
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
and give her a surprise.

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,140
She'll be like, "Oh, so many roses!"

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,980
"Lin Mu, you're the best."

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,860
How is it? Perfect, right?

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
I'm not sure.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,300
Weiling doesn't seem to like flowers.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,180
Is your confession

56
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,820
the battle of Normandy

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,540
or the tragic battle of Waterloo?

58
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,500
Again.

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,670
Let me tell you.

60
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,290
Keep your mouth shut. Do you hear me?

61
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,500
Rest assured.

62
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,180
As a high-quality audience,

63
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,710
before the leading actors get together,

64
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,780
I won't say a thing.

65
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,780
Lin Mu, Xie Yuan. Hurry up.

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,260
Everyone is here. Come on.

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,260
- Coming.
- Let's go.

68
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,660
(Weiling, I love you!)

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,460
Since everyone is here today,

70
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,860
I want to say a few words first.

71
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,180
During our event yesterday,

72
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,700
we almost had an accident.

73
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,660
I want to apologize to everyone.

74
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,500
Weiling had an emergency,

75
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,980
and I didn't prepare a backup plan,

76
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,620
so it almost caused a major mistake.

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,020
So, I'm conducting a self-examination.

78
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,180
Speaking of this,

79
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,900
I want to thank Han Xiaoli.

80
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,740
Thanks to you,

81
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,820
I didn't make such a big mistake.

82
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,180
That's enough.
We're all on the same team.

83
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,180
Okay, today's theme

84
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,600
is to celebrate Weiling's one-year
anniversary with the team.

85
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,140
Except for me, in this team,

86
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,780
Weiling is the first official member.

87
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,420
And in the past year,

88
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,220
everyone has seen her efforts.

89
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,660
Oh, please.

90
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,180
I propose that we all toast to her.

91
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,580
Yes!

92
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,450
Thank you, everyone.

93
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,160
Cheers to Weiling.

94
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,500
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

95
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,180
Everyone, let's start eating.

96
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,580
Let's eat.

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,020
Put some ingredients in.

98
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Put some lamb too.

99
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,060
- Okay.
- Here.

100
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,380
Thank you.

101
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,260
I propose
that we have another round of toast.

102
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,060
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

103
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,700
Come on.

104
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

105
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,620
Weiling,
aren't you going to say a few words?

106
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,460
Okay, I'll say a few words.

107
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,300
Actually, since everyone is busy
with work most of the time,

108
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,900
I wanted to take this opportunity
for everyone to gather.

109
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,740
I really like working at Polar Night.

110
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,820
I also like every colleague
at Polar Night.

111
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,420
Including Lin Mu?

112
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,260
Weiling, you continue.

113
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,780
Actually, this one year wasn't too long

114
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,720
and wasn't too short.

115
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,100
Every day with you all at Polar Night,

116
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,670
and every mission we undertake,

117
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,860
I find them very meaningful.

118
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,180
Actually, today,
I want to take this opportunity

119
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,460
to say a few words too.

120
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,140
Before, when Xingchen told me

121
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,780
she wanted to join the rescue team
as a volunteer,

122
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,100
I was thinking

123
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,310
that she's already so busy.
Isn't she tired enough?

124
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,980
But these past few days,

125
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,860
after completing the event
with everyone,

126
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,340
I have also begun
to like the atmosphere here.

127
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,200
In the future,
if there's anything needed,

128
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,250
as long as I can help,

129
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,340
feel free to ask.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,980
Cheers to everyone.
I'm happy to know you all.

131
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
Come on, cheers.

132
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,740
- Thank you.
- Cheers!

133
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,540
Lin Mu.

134
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,980
Today is such an important day
for Weiling,

135
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,500
aren't you going to say a few words?

136
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,700
Okay, I'll say a few words.

137
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,380
Everyone knows this.

138
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,220
Polar Night is my second home.

139
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,580
So...

140
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
Thanks to Polar Night,

141
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,500
I've developed a strong physique.

142
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
And also...

143
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,020
Also...

144
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,300
Say it.

145
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,180
Then also...

146
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,740
Say it.

147
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,500
I forgot.

148
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,300
Alright, I'll finish this drink.

149
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,060
You guys don't need
to drink with me, okay?

150
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,660
- Nice.
- No problem.

151
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,540
Awesome!

152
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,650
Zhou Yao, don't get ahead of yourself.
It's your turn.

153
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm just a tech guy, you know.

154
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,970
Before this, I spent every day
in front of the computer.

155
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,980
Basically, aside from code,

156
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,660
I didn't even have a friend.

157
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,330
After coming to Polar Night, I realized

158
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,180
I can not only

159
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,980
solve problems in the virtual world,

160
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,980
but I can also use my expertise

161
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,940
to help others.

162
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,860
At Polar Night, I've met everyone,

163
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,180
especially Lu.

164
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,620
I'm very happy.

165
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,420
Only after knowing him did I find
that life can be so exciting.

166
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,340
Thanks, Lu.

167
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,540
Thanks to everyone

168
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
for sincerely treating me as a friend.

169
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,340
Here. Thank you.

170
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,180
Well said!

171
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,740
- Come on. Cheers.
- Cheers!

172
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,860
Lu Qun.

173
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,180
Weiling.

174
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
What's your vision

175
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,100
or requirements
for your future boyfriend?

176
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,980
- Yeah, what kind?
- What kind?

177
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,540
Why suddenly talk about this?

178
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,740
Everyone wants to know, right?

179
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,020
Right.

180
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,820
Tell us.

181
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,500
If you really want to know,

182
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,160
it's best if he's
physically stronger than me.

183
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,260
And he should love reading,

184
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,140
be efficient in both brainy
and brawny activities, detail in work,

185
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,300
and not a careless person.

186
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,500
Also,
he shouldn't casually give flowers,

187
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,100
especially roses. It's tacky.

188
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,860
What's wrong with you?

189
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,900
- What's wrong?
- Is it you?

190
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,540
Is it you?

191
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,380
I'm fine.

192
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,580
He choked.

193
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,020
Weiling, you sound hard to woo.

194
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,540
Look like

195
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,580
someone won't be able to sleep again.

196
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,140
Who could it be?

197
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,060
Enough, let's eat.

198
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,020
Thank you all for coming

199
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,690
to celebrate
my one-year work anniversary.

200
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,340
Thanks.

201
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,780
Come on, cheers!

202
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,520
Happy one-year anniversary.

203
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,700
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

204
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,260
Weiling just casually mentioned it.

205
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,660
Don't take it too seriously.

206
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,260
What do you understand?

207
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,210
She said she doesn't like it.
I'll only get scolded for giving her.

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,100
Xie Yuan.

209
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,540
Are women all so troublesome,

210
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,580
or is it just her?

211
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,620
How could I

212
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,020
like such a strange woman?

213
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,440
Maybe I should consider someone else.

214
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,820
I can't. If it's someone else,
I don't have this feeling.

215
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,140
Hey, bro.

216
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,010
I've told you so much.

217
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,040
Can't you give me some...

218
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,140
What?

219
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,340
Flowers.

220
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,500
Flowers.

221
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,700
Let me see.

222
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,820
Why did you want to give me flowers?

223
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,020
Isn't it your one-year work anniversary?

224
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes.

225
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,740
One-year work anniversary,
and you gave me roses?

226
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,500
What's written?

227
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,660
Nothing.

228
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,460
Nothing.

229
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,380
Chocolate flavor.

230
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,220
If you drink too much, go rest.

231
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,130
I'll accept the flowers.

232
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,500
By the way,

233
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,140
don't imitate Captain Lu
with those nonsense.

234
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,180
If you want to date me, beat me first.

235
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,180
Wait, beat...

236
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,500
If I beat you, I'll feel sorry.

237
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,620
If I can't beat you, my heart will ache.

238
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,300
So either way, it's painful for me.

239
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,940
The activity you must try. Paragliding.

240
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Looks like a lot of fun.

241
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,470
Do you want to try it?

242
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,060
Sure.

243
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,940
Aren't you nervous?

244
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,770
Aren't first-timers supposed
to be nervous when they fly?

245
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,730
I'm nervous,

246
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,140
but I have you with me, right?

247
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,940
Let's go.

248
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,960
(Freefly Paragliding Base)

249
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,060
Gao Qingyin.

250
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,740
Why are you here too?

251
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,830
Our paths seem to be destined to cross.

252
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,860
Song Xingchen invited you?

253
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,180
No, I'm making a promotional video
for Polar Night.

254
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,140
Since I have time,
I came to shoot some material.

255
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,860
Meeting you is really unfortunate.

256
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,980
Is Song Xingchen here too?

257
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,570
Is it Su Qingche who brought her?

258
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,220
They're a couple paragliding.

259
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,500
Why are you meddling in this?

260
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,470
It's none of your business.

261
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,020
Since the opening of this base,

262
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,300
Qingche has taken me here every year
on my birthday.

263
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,220
We just happened
to bring Song Xingchen along.

264
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,580
If it truly was just a casual thing,

265
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,380
why didn't you two share a car?

266
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,540
What do you know?

267
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,020
Qingche brings me here every year

268
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,180
and always helps me
put on my helmet himself.

269
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,860
He will then
secure the safety rope for me

270
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,740
and repeatedly check it.

271
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,020
Other than my parents,

272
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,660
he cares for me the most.

273
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,420
He even promised me

274
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,980
he'd paraglide with me

275
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,300
after getting his license.

276
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,580
Do you know what that means?

277
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,260
What does it mean?

278
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,300
It means his promise to me.

279
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
He promised

280
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,820
he'd learn paragliding
because I like it.

281
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,060
Great.

282
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,180
This is amazing.

283
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,620
How does it feel?

284
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,260
It's so beautiful.
Look over there. It's gorgeous.

285
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,460
Some places and scenery

286
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,860
can only be seen from high places.

287
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,260
You should try more in the future.

288
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,360
Aren't you worried
I'll fly too high and too far,

289
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,270
never to return?

290
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,540
No. No matter how high or far you fly,

291
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,260
I'll be here with you like now.

292
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,100
Forever with you.

293
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,540
You won't be able to run away.

294
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,300
A few ropes can't hold me back.

295
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,820
If you want to keep me around,

296
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,690
you have to keep me
on my toes constantly.

297
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,980
Women require a lifetime pursuit,
understand?

298
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,630
Understand.

299
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,180
I'll pursue you for life.

300
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,900
Attaboy.

301
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,650
It's beautiful.

302
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,700
We're preparing to turn left.
Look over there.

303
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,730
Qingyin, you're here.

304
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,220
Coach, where's Qingche?

305
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,010
He's already paragliding
with his girlfriend.

306
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,300
With his girlfriend?

307
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,900
Yeah, the one in pink.

308
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,900
Without a license, doesn't he
need an instructor for gliding?

309
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,580
He acquired his license way before me,

310
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,060
and his license has a longer validity.

311
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,970
Qingyin, I'm going now.

312
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,190
He promised me

313
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,580
he'd paraglide with me

314
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,180
after getting his license.

315
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,060
Because that's his promise to me.

316
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,580
It seems

317
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,100
he clearly doesn't want
to get too close to you.

318
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,980
Captain Su is such a gentleman.

319
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,140
He's definite about who's his sister

320
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,910
and who's his girlfriend.

Why are you here?

349
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,580
They're together now.

350
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,330
They'll surely invite both of us
for a meal,

351
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,380
and I can't wait.

352
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,060
Move aside.

353
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,170
This seat is for Xingchen.

354
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Why don't you understand anything?

355
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,740
Surely, we'll sit on one side,

356
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,140
and they'll sit on the other.

357
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,860
Wingmen need to act like one.

358
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,100
Are you clear about today's mission?

359
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,500
What mission?

360
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,260
Qingche

361
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,940
has posted photos of them in Sucheng,

362
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,580
yet Ms. Song hasn't made any move.

363
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,300
She isn't making it public.

364
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,020
What your bestie is doing is wrong.

365
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
Does love always have to be announced?

366
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,580
Is it for oneself

367
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,820
or for the spectators?

368
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,060
Alright, if that's how you see it.

369
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,340
You see, quite a few people
are pursuing Captain Su.

370
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,620
Forget about the ones from afar,
you know Qingyin.

371
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,540
Announcing it soon
to resolve the situation

372
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,460
would benefit both sides,
don't you think?

373
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,620
You're right.

374
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,640
However, whether or not to announce it
is her own choice.

375
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,620
Don't morally pressure here.

376
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,060
Got it, why would I?

377
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,980
I wouldn't.

378
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,460
The lipstick you're wearing today

379
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,620
was the one I gave you, right?

380
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,340
I see your experience in relationships

381
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,900
isn't entirely pointless.

382
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,980
Your knack for connecting with women

383
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,860
is stronger than most guys.

384
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,820
Yeah, I'm strong, and that's good.

385
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,940
You're beautiful,
so whatever you say is right.

386
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,460
Waiter, order.

387
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,640
Should I still address you by your name?

388
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,500
If not, what should you call me?

389
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,380
Sweetie? Babe?

390
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,220
Please don't. Just the usual.

391
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,060
Cheers to the couple.

392
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,140
Congratulations.

393
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,700
Did you have a great time in Sucheng?

394
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,340
We had a blast.

395
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,220
Why are you curious?

396
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,980
It's nothing.
I just noticed you didn't post anything

397
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,540
on your social media.

398
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,180
I took a lot of photos.

399
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,820
I'll show you.

400
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,420
Really?

401
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,740
Really? I'd love to see.

402
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,500
Here.

403
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,540
I want to go and have fun, too.

404
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,140
Right?

405
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,420
You're here.

406
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,220
Come here. Hurry.

407
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,660
Jiang, we were discussing you.

408
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,620
Sorry.

409
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,380
Traffic was too congested.

410
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,460
You're late.

411
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,550
Take a drink as a penalty.

412
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,940
Take it.

413
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,700
Xingchen.

414
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,740
Look.

415
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,380
Is it necessary

416
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,820
to make such a fuss over this?

417
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,500
She's like this with a bit of alcohol.

418
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,940
She enjoys looking at eye candies.

419
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
But honestly speaking,

420
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,660
he's pretty good-looking.

421
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,470
You can try hitting on him.

422
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,260
Isn't he?

423
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,140
Do you think I should say hi?

424
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,100
Sure.

425
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,900
But what if I get rejected?

426
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,620
That's elementary.

427
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,580
Just say you failed a dare

428
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,940
and you're asked to get his number,

429
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,660
or you lost your phone

430
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,580
and you need his phone for an emergency.

431
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
There are plenty of ways.

432
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,900
You sound like a veteran.

433
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,500
Come on, I'm almost thirty.

434
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,900
Won't I look pretentious

435
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,210
if I act like an innocent girl?

436
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,300
Come clean, then.

437
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,020
Have you used these tricks on me?

438
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,820
No, yours are tailored.

439
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,460
Alright,

440
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,420
I'll make the first move this time.

441
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,780
You just wait and see.

442
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,380
Xiaoli, sit.

443
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,980
What are you doing?

444
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,860
Qingche and I are right here,

445
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,340
and you want to hit on another guy?

446
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,420
Show us some respect.

447
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,300
What's wrong with that?

448
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,580
Besides,

449
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,140
look at him. He's exactly my type.

450
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,780
What a gentleman.

451
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,730
Yeah, sure. He's not even
half as good-looking as me.

452
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,220
Hey, Xiaoli, focus. We have a mission.

453
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,140
What's up with you?

454
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,420
What mission?

455
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,860
What do you think?

456
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,900
What's up with you?

457
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
What mission?

458
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,980
Come on, speak up.

459
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,900
Actually I...

460
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,180
He wants you to post on Moments

461
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,420
to publicize your relationship
with Captain Su.

462
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,380
But he's worried that you're unwilling.

463
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,230
Do you think so, too?

464
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,070
Be honest.

465
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,180
Yeah.

466
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,020
If it's just for your entertainment,

467
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,420
then I won't cooperate.

468
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,380
But if Captain Su shares the same idea,

469
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,460
then, of course, I'll go along with it.

470
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,980
Come on.

471
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,620
Wonderful.

472
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,980
Alright, our mission's
considered a success.

473
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,540
Come on, cheers.

474
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Cheers.

475
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,260
Eat up.

476
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,340
Their food is great, really.

477
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,500
Which one to post?

478
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,100
This one.

479
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,020
No, it's not formal enough.

480
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,010
We're publicizing, no?
We should be more intimate.

481
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,180
Let's go with this one.

482
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,660
Alright, I'll block the elders,

483
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
or it'd be too awkward.

484
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,480
Other than the elders, everyone can see.

485
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,020
Post it.

486
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,720
(It's official.)

487
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,680

Alright, as you wished.

488
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,660
Alright, cheers.

489
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,380
- Drink up.
- Where's that handsome guy?

490
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,460
Lu Qun, this is all your fault.

491
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,580
Oh, come on.

Two of Haicheng's most handsome guys
are right here.

493
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,260
Hurry up and drink.

494
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,620
Come on, eat. Drink.

495
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,100
Congratulations.

496
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,310
Drink up before going home.

497
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,660
Cheers.

498
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,340

I'm your girlfriend,

507

yet I'm the last to find out.

508
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,050
Are you intending to tell me
only after flying off?

Don't be like this, please.

I'm just going abroad to study.

00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,220
And with the internet so developed now,

520
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,380
we can stay in touch anytime.

521
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,110

about this before.

525

From now on,

526
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
your life

527
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,330
has nothing to do with me.

528
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,340
So she's the first love

529
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,750
you could never let go, huh?

530
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,060
What, feeling aggrieved now?

531
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,020
No.

532
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,860
You regret it, then.

533
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,300
You think you made the mistake

534
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,660
of leaving her.

535
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,900
I made the choice back then.

536
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,580
I can't and shouldn't regret it.

537
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,940
Studying abroad on scholarship

538
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,620
was an opportunity I couldn't miss.

539
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,420
I regret it deeply.

540
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,460
But as adults,

541
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,380
we should
hold our decisions accountable.

Nothing I do now

543
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,420
can amend the mistakes

544
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,060
I made in the past.

545

546
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,860
Have you ever expressed
your most honest thoughts

547
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,780
to her?

548
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,660
I don't think so.

549
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,100
So, why sulk here

550
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,580
instead of telling her the truth?

551
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,190
You won't know you've lost your chances
until you speak up.

552
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,420
If it were me,

553
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,420
I would try.

554
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,060
What if she still has feelings for you?

555
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,100
What brings you here?

556
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,180
I wanted to see you.

557
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,000
You've been drinking.

558
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,260
But I'm also sober.

559
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,100
I have something to tell you.

560
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,220
Alright, go ahead.

561
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,900
Xingchen.

562
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,180
I should've apologized to you long ago.

563
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,260
Back then, I was so eager for success

564
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,020
that I failed to consider your feelings.

565
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,180
I regretted it as soon as I got there.

566
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,380
Our relationship
is water under the bridge now.

567
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,460
No, let me finish.

568
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,740
After I went there,

569
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,580
other than going to campus every day,

570
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,740
the only place I'd be at

571
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,060
was that five-square-yard room.

572
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,500
I had no friends.

573
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,240
It's the memories with you
over these years

574
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,060
that have supported me until now.

575
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,740
Do you know how badly I wish

576
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,990
we could go back to the past?

577
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,220
Do you know how badly
I want to salvage everything?

578
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,900
But after I went there,

579
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,700
you deleted all my contact information.

580
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,900
I could only send you emails.

581
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,580
I've written

582
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,260
all my thoughts for you in there,

583
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,580
but you never replied.

584
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,020
I never replied

585
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,100
because there was no need.

586
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,700
I'll be honest with you.
I never even opened them.

587
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,140
You weren't wrong
to prioritize your future.

588
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,460
Of course,

589
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,220
I was indeed livid,

590
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,420
but I couldn't blame you either.

591
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
So, each of us

592
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,300
has to hold our decisions accountable.

593
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,940
Many years have passed,

594
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,580
and I've long moved on.

595
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,260
Are you still there?

596
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,740
Actually, I'm quite relieved.

597
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,100
Relieved that you moved on.

598
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,860
All these years,
other than being regretful,

599
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,580
I also feel guilty.

600
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,140
I've also been thinking.

601
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,780
If you never moved on,

602
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,620
I would do everything
to make it up to you.

603
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,500
But you've already started anew,

604
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,090
and I will still wish you happiness.

605
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,860
I'm dating Su Qingche now,

606
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
so I'm sorry.

607
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,260
I, too, hope that you can move on soon.

608
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,340
Don't worry.

609
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,500
But make sure you're happier than me.

610
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,900
I will.

611
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,900
It's getting late. I'll head back.

612
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:42,860
Alright.

613
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,340

Alright.

635
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,500
Xiaoli.

636
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,100
After we took over LYS's products,

637
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,900
the results are better than expected.

638
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,180
But I think the product variety
is too limited,

639
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,410
and the updates are too slow.

640
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,700
If this continues,

641
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,080
we might not retain customers.

642
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,850
What do you have in mind, babe?

643
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,260
We need to open a subsidiary line.

644
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,580
LYS can be the main brand,

645
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,180
but I think we should introduce

646
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,490
some products from other brands.

647
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,800
But if we get products from middlemen,

648
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,890
the cost and selling price difference
are too small,

649
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,360
and the profit margin is very narrow.

650
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,020
Upfront profits are not important.

651
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,180
The key is to enrich product variety

652
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,180
and retain customers.

653
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,620
But if we get products from middlemen,

654
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,430
we still need to ensure
good quality control

655
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,620
and check every product

656
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,420
we sell thoroughly.

657
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,020
No problem.

658
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,270
I saw a brand the other day,

659
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,460
and it looked quite good.

660
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,620
Let's give it a try.

661
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,140
Alright.

The public welfare effect this time

663
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,960
(Official Account Data Statistics)
is good indeed.

664
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,380
The video we shot

665
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,740
on the official account

666
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,140
has already exceeded 50,000 views.

667
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,140
Fifteen media outlets

668
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,380
have reported on it accordingly.

669
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,550
The playback volume of self-media
that can be found

670
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,010
has already exceeded several million.

671
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,420
It's indeed very good.

672
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,540
But I think it can be even better.

673
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,860
But Captain Lu has stopped posting

674
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,500
educational videos lately.

675
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,790
I've thought about that, too.

676
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,060
After all,

677
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,060
Captain Lu has reached

678
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,180
a creative block.

679
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,090
He's reached his limit, that's what.

680
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,580
I'll leave this task to you.

681
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,700
Keep it at one post a week.

682
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,220
Me?

683
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,100
Any problem?

684
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,380
None.

685
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,220
Captain Lu.

686
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,130
You've caused quite the trouble.

687
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,780
Quite the trouble indeed.

688
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,060
What's up?

689
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,380
Captain Su.

690
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,540
I've come to make a self-critique.

691
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,620
I failed to handle the situation well

692
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,100
while you were away at Sucheng.

693
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,540
Don't worry about it.

694
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,260
What happened to Ding Weiling

695
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,180
was also unexpected.

696
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,980
If something like this happens again,

697
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,580
you just file it in advance.

698
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,100
Rest assured.

699
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,260
This incident

700
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,980
has seared into my brain.

701
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,380
It will never happen again.

702
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,860
Did Gao Qingyin not contact you
yesterday?

703
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,580
No.

704
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,460
Why?

705
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,420
By right, if she hadn't responded
to Ms. Song's declaration,

706
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,500
she should have

707
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,820
come looking for you here.

708
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,380
Did she not?

709
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,560
Isn't that a good thing?

710
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,580
Grandpa told me

711
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,140
they had a long conversation.

712
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,580
In that case,
he must've talked some sense into her.

713
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,880
That's likely the case.

714
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,580
Anything else?

715
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,620
The guy Han Xiaoli was looking
at last night.

716
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,560
Was he really handsome?

717
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,380
Honestly?

718
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,400
I don't know.
I didn't take a good look.

719
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,940
Is she blind or something?

720
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,260
How could he be more handsome than me?

721
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,300
He was indeed more handsome than you.

722
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,660
What did you just say?

723
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,020
You're the most handsome.

724
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,820
Right?

725
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,980
You're more handsome than him.

726
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,260
I knew it. I'm more handsome than him.

727
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,890
That's a no-brainer.

728
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:40,940
Ready?

729
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,380
Let's begin.

730
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,100
Alright.

731
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,180

734
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,460
How is it?

735
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,700
Do we need to reshoot?

736
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,780
Forget it. We'll call it a day today.

737
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,220

738
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,560

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,820
Good job.

740
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,500
Thank you.

741
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:19,940
Let's go.

742
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,940
I'll take you to the green room first,

743
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,100
then I'll coordinate
with the production team.

744
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,660
(Supermodel)

745
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,520
Alright, stay right there.

746
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,140
I'm off.

747
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,060
Wait.

748
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,960
Are you leaving just like this?

749
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,740
I'm done for the day.

750
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,180
I checked the photos on the computer.

751
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,740
How will you guys rank
with her condition like that?

752
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,380
Tell me.

753
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,140
I suggest that

754
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,730
you guys continue filming,

755
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,820
and I'll arrange another reshoot

756
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,100
with Gao Qingyin.

757
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,020
Is this your production?

758
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,020
Do you two think you can

759
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,980
reshoot as you please?

760
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,300
Talk some sense into her

761
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,860
right away,

762
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,140
or I'll bring the contract out.

763
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,900
She's just an insignificant model,
not a diva.

764
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,380
Come on, don't say that.

765
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,340
Yes,

766
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,500
she signed a contract with you guys,

767
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,860
but she's human too.
Can't you be considerate?

768
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,170
I'm telling you,

769
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,420
if Gao Qingyin doesn't participate,
I'll withdraw too.

770
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,370
I fought hard to get this opportunity
for you.

771
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,260
What are you doing?

772
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,300
Mengnan.

773
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,420
Where's Gao Qingyin?

774
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,840
She called and said
she had to leave early for something.

775
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,060
Is she really doing okay today?

776
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,220
I don't know.

777
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,040
She has been like this
since returning from Sucheng.

778
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,490
She wouldn't say anything, either.

779
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,780
I've never seen her like this before.

780
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,940
Do you need something from her?

781
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,420
No, nothing. Thank you.

782
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,020
Alright.

783
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,820
I should try texting.

784
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,020
A post?

785
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,120
(Gao Qingyin: I'm going to a new world!)

786
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,460
Shoot.

787
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,680
Gao Qingyin!

788
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,900
Gao Qingyin, don't do anything foolish.

789
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,100
We can figure anything out.

790
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm waiting for the tide to rise.

791
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,300
You've got the wrong time.
It's ebbing now.

792
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,220
Even if it rises,
it won't reach your feet.

793
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,580
What brings you here?

794
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,580
What's up with that Moment?

795
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,090
You scared the hell out of me.

796
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,780
I'm heartbroken.

797
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,900
I want to leave the old world

798
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,580
and start anew in the new one.

799
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,820
What's the matter?

800
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,980
Where did you learn
this melancholic stuff?

801
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,100
How are you doing now?

802
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,500
You know,

803
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,100
I've never seen

804
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,060
Qingche with that smile and tone before.

805
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,180
But strangely,

806
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,980
when I tried so hard

807
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,100
to take a picture of me crying
over the sunset,

808
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,300
I couldn't shed a single tear
no matter how.

809
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,540
It sounds like you don't like him
as much as you think.

810
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,980
Impossible.

811
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,540
If you ask me,

812
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
what you have for Qingche isn't love

813
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,140
but obsession.

814
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,220
Your feelings for him
are entirely different

815
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,410
from your love for your lover.

816
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,690
Maybe because it has been so long

817
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,200
that you can't tell them apart anymore.

818
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,020
You talk just like Mengnan.

819
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,540
Onlookers just see better.

820
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,260
Qingche used to always say

821
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,820
I'm his little sister.

822
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,100
So I always thought, so what?

823
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,820
Didn't people in love

824
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,820
always start off as friends, colleagues,
classmates,

825
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,020
or even online friends?

826
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,740
As his childhood sweetheart,

827
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,260
by right,

828
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,980
I should have the upper hand, right?

829
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,700
But I get it now.

830
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,780
The difference
between a sister and a lover

831
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,660
is whether he has feelings for you.

832
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,380
Have you figured it out now?

833
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,700
Why couldn't I

834
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,980
have understood it sooner?

835
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,420
It's good that you can come around now.

836
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,540
You're right.

837
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,780
Su Qingche, I don't like you anymore!

838
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,140
Childhood sweethearts, my foot!

839
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,620
Arranged marriage, my foot!

840
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,740
Go pursue your love!

841
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,780
Shout with me.

842
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,620
Shout with you?

843
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,820
Su Qingche, I don't like you anymore!

844
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,940
Su Qingche, I don't like you anymore!

845
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,460
I never loved you!

846
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,100
Su Qingche, I never loved you!

847
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,100
Su Qingche, I will never like you again!

848
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,580
Su Qingche,
I certainly will never like you again!

849
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,660
Thanks for today.

850
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,620
I heard your conversation
with your senior.

851
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,100
You see,

852
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,200
I'm naturally righteous.

853
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,780
Besides, I injured your foot

854
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,100
by accident at the center.

855
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,780
I owe you this much.

856
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,380
So, are you feeling better now?

857
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,380
Much better.

858
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,780
That's good.

859
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,020
Let me show you something.

860
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,340
Let me tell you,

861
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,460
when you're heartbroken,
you should play with sparklers.

862
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,020
