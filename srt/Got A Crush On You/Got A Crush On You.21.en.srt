(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,680
=Episode 21=

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,120
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

25
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,500
Since Lu

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,860
took me to my first drinking session.

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,860
I never knew I could live life
like that.

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,340
(Lu, you always said)

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,180
(that I)

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,220
(am too cowardly)

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,660
(and too timid)

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
(and have no idea
how to hit up strangers.)

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,860
Especially girls.

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,260
I should learn from you.

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,020
(And then,)

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,620
(through Lu,)

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,980
(I got into the goddess group)

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,740
(and added a girl.)

39
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,980
(Then I chatted with her.)

40
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,740
(I copied)

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,460
(how Lu talks to girls.)

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,460
(Eventually,)

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,260
(I think the girl accepted me.)

44
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,740
Since that moment,

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,820
from Lu's Moments,

46
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,460
I got myself

47
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,500
some of his photos.

48
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,900
Often, I think to myself,

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,780
why do I do this?

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
This won't just impact your reputation.

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,300
More importantly,

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,140
(I'm still the same guy)

53
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,390
(hiding in the corner)

54
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,860
(like a mouse in the shadows.)

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,420
I know...

56
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,640
I know this would come to light
eventually.

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,940
You can punish me how you want.

58
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,040
I won't say anything.

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,140
When I get back,

60
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,980
I'll apologize

61
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,470
to all the girls I've hit up.

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,620
Zhou Yao.

63
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,140
We won't punish you.

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,460
Aside from clearing things up
with the ladies,

65
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,260
you have to reflect on yourself.

66
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
We won't tell anyone

67
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,820
about this matter,

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,860
but promise us

69
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,860
there will be no next time.

70
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,540
I'll go back and pack

71
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,820
and leave.

72
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,820
Zhou Yao.

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,720
Even if you guys
keep this a secret for me,

74
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,060
I can't face you and Lu anymore.

75
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,540
Nor can I face the rescue team.

76
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,060
I...

77
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,180
I don't deserve to stay

78
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,620
in Polar Night anymore.

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,600
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

80
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,220
Zhou Yao.

81
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,780
Lu.

83
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,340
I'm the one who messed up.

84
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,380
Actually,

85
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,820
since you joined us,

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,340
I have always seen you

87
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,860
as my little brother.

88
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,700
I never thought

89
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,820
everything I did

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,340
would hurt you so much.

91
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,820
If I could know you sooner,

92
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,620
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

93
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,420
Thank you,

94
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,460
Lu.

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
But this time,

96
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
I did you wrong.

97
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,140
I embarrassed you.

98
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,740
No matter what,

99
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,100
I always see you

100
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,780
as the best brother I ever had.

101
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,940
See you.

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,940
Bro.

103
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,180
Take care.

104
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,740
Hi, your coffee's done.

105
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,660
Yeah, thanks.

106
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,460
No problem.

107
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,570
Careful, it's hot.

108
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,620
Xiaoli.

109
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,660
Your hot americano, no sugar.

110
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,140
Finally cleared things up.

111
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,900
The ladies in the group said

112
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,780
Zhou Yao texted them

113
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,820
and apologized sincerely.

114
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,180
Good thing this incident didn't cause

115
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
any real harm.

116
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,580
That Zhou Yao

117
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,460
seems so honest.

118
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,890
I can't believe he'd do this.

119
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,940
Part of this

120
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,900
is my fault.

121
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,540
You're right.

122
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,860
If you

123
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,140
hadn't used him like a gofer

124
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,660
and taught him

125
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,980
stupid ideas,

126
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,060
he wouldn't have done this

127
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,420
and used you as his role model.

128
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,700
You're the real culprit.

129
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,140
If that's how you want to put it,

130
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,620
then I think you're prejudiced.

131
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,660
Alright.

132
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,420
I'll stroll with Xingchen.

133
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,980
You guys chat.

134
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,180
Bye.

135
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,260
Xiaoli.

136
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,860
So...

137
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,380
Um...

138
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,660
Hey, things are cleared up.

139
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,420
Can I take off the title

140
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,380
of casanova?

141
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,660
Even if we put this thing aside,

142
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,940
you cannot deny

143
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,740
that you love to flirt around.

144
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,340
Or else why

145
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,980
did everyone think you did it?

146
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,620
I...

147
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,740
If you don't trust me,

148
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
then why did you help me?

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,340
Because I see you as a friend.

150
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,290
I don't want anyone
to misunderstand you.

151
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,580
And I have a group of friends

152
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,940
waiting for the truth to come out.

153
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,300
Besides,

154
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,980
I accused you before,

155
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,440
so now that I've helped you
prove your innocence,

156
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,060
we're even.

157
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,220
No, we're not even yet.

158
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,380
I don't want to be hurt.

159
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,660
So let's not even start anything.

160
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,660
That way, we can still be friends.

Don't worry.

167
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,340

Don't be a stranger.

174
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,460
You gave me tons of jobs.

175
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,500
Don't worry, mate. You can count on me.

176
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,060
Sure. I'll be going now. Business calls.

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,420

Hello?

180
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,140
(Hello, Qingyin.)

181
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,140
(I need your help with something.)

182
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,140

183
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,940

(Can you help me?)

186
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,060
Sure thing.

187
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,380
The pay doesn't matter. I'll help.

188
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,940
Give me the time and location.

189
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,150
We'll meet up there.

190
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,980

191
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,380
Our schedule's full.

192
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,500
It's fine.

193
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,580
I can sacrifice my rest.

194
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,620
I have to say this,

195
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,730
even though you don't like to hear it.

196
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,140
After giving up on your crush,

197
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,220
you'll feel empty for a while,

198
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,180
but you have to be careful.

199
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,620
You can't fill that hole up
with some random people.

200
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,210
What are you talking about?

201
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,100
I am not doing that.

202
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,260
Honestly,

203
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,060
getting a rebound is no big deal,

204
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,100
but you have to be smart.

205
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,620
This guy

206
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,700
doesn't look reliable.

207
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,900
Not to mention

208
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,060
he doesn't feel manly at all.

209
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,700
On top of that,

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,700
he's Song Xingchen's nephew.

211
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,540
Don't talk nonsense.

212
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,540
I just don't want to owe him.

213
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,380
Let's go to the next job.

214
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,740
Gao Qingyin is out.

215
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,850
Prepare for the next scene.

216
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,340
Next scene.

217
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,860
You're here.

218
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,940
How did the talk with Lu Qun go?

219
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I refused him.

220
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,060
There are so many men in the world.

221
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,980
I don't have to date
a ticking time bomb.

222
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,980
True.

223
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,860
Any choice you make,

224
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,940
I support it.

225
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,980
Hug.

226
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,730
What are you looking at?

227
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,950
Tons of DMs here,

228
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,510
and they want to know about the essence
to get rid of cellulites.

229
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,380
I bought some

230
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,470
for some product research.

231
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,060
No wonder you've been working

232
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,620
in front of the computer these days.

233
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,940
So that's what you've been up to.

234
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,780
Boss, need you to sign this delivery.

235
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,340
Coming.

236
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,070
I bought a ton,
so I have to try them out.

237
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,260
I'll take them.

238
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,260
Han Xiaoli.

239
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,420
What?

240
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,740
In a bad mood?

241
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,260
I thought after you gave up

242
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,940
hounding Qingche,

243
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,300
you'd have nothing to worry about.

244
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,140
It's not for Qingche.

245
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,140
I just think

246
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,460
if I get

247
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,040
the feeling of caring about someone,

248
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,250
things opposite of what I want
will happen.

249
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,220
Caring about someone?

250
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,300
Not Qingche?

251
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,980
Who is it, then?

252
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,450
Thanks.

253
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,900
No problem.

254
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,580
Thanks.

255
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Before this,

256
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,740
I thought I only liked Qingche,

257
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,100
but now,

258
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,820
I know that's not the case.

259
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,820
Yeah.

260
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,900
You can't control

261
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,660
who you like

262
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,660
and who you don't.

263
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,020
Ever since I met that guy,

264
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,780
for some reason,

265
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,700
I keep thinking about him.

266
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,540
Every time I think about him,

267
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,540
I would wish time would stop.

268
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,460
Are you

269
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,180
thinking about someone?

270
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,020
No.

271
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,100
I am not.

272
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,140
Do you have someone you like?

273
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,780
Absolutely not.

274
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,020
However,

275
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,260
I'm not too sure

276
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,060
how I feel about him.

277
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,220
Because I keep feeling

278
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,050
that he probably doesn't like me
very much.

279
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,820
After all, he knows

280
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,300
Qingche is the one I like.

281
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,980
I'm talking about a different kind
of crush here.

282
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,500
You should tell him, then.

283
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,860
What if I do that,

284
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,620
and we can't even become friends?

285
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,420
True.

286
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,740
We promised to be buddies.

287
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,500
Besides,

288
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,700
I gave up first.

289
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,260
Exactly.

290
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,820
You shouldn't confess so easily.

291
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,220
But that wasn't what you said earlier.

292
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,420
Why'd you change your mind?

293
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,540
What I meant was

294
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,190
you should observe how he feels,

295
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,680
then you make your decision.

296
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,250
And first you must make sure

297
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,580
if you really like him.

298
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,040
If your feelings for him are like
how you feel for Qingche,

299
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,960
the misunderstanding will be a disaster.

300
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,930
Yeah. So how should I
confirm my feelings?

301
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,780
First, you have to know
what kind of men you like.

302
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,340
Or at least,

303
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,740
you have to know
what kind of men you don't like.

304
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
For example, back in my university days,

305
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,140
I had a crush on a senior.

306
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,660
Turned out he was a jerk

307
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,180
who played a lot of women.

308
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,060
But I think the guy

309
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,180
is handsome and gentle.

310
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,100
Even though I hated him back then,

311
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,020
I then realized

312
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,220
he wasn't that annoying.

313
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,540
If I find out I like a playboy,

314
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,230
what should I do?

315
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,500
If I run into a playboy,

316
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
I'd destroy him.

317
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,190
Do good for the people.

318
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,690
Professor Tang.

319
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,180
Hey, Madam Hu.

320
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,700
(Hello, Tang.)

321
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,620
(Are you busy?)

322
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,690
What do you need my help with?

323
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,300
If you're free in the afternoon,

324
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,500
I want you to go over
to Xingchen's place,

325
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,790
and we'll have lunch together.

326
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,780
Xingchen's place?

327
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,460
(Yeah.)

328
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,300
(Xingchen's been busy lately.)

329
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,420
Her father and I want to go over

330
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,780
in the afternoon.

331
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,100
Make lunch for her

332
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,660
(so she can eat better.)

333
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,300
(If you have time,)

334
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,660
(come over.)

335
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,340
It's been a while since we saw you.

336
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,260
We miss you.

337
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,530
It's alright, Madam Hu.

338
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,050
Going over like this may not be proper.

339
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,140
What's bad about it?

340
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,940
Just come over, Tang.

341
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,740
I'll tell Xingchen about it later.

342
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,500
Okay then.

343
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,660
Oh, it's clean here.

344
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,380
Not bad.

345
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,700
I bet the house is squalid, though.

346
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,100
So what?

347
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,260
You can find a princess anywhere.

348
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,660
Slum princess, more like.

349
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,300
Yeah, you spoil the girl.

350
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,380
What's her address again?

351
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,220
Before you came,

352
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,020
you should've called her.

353
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,140
Why should I call

354
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,720
when I'm going to my daughter's place?

355
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,620
We're just here to cook for her

356
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,980
and give her stuff.

357
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,940
Who...

358
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,100
Who are you?

359
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,820
Me?

360
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,180
Did we get the wrong house?

361
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,910
No. This is the right one.

362
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,940
You must

363
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,380
be the janitor, right?

364
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,740
Yeah, I am.

365
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,540
Ms. Song hired me

366
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,700
to clean her place up.

367
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,460
And you are?

368
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,980
We're her parents.

369
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,260
Here to see her.

370
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,660
Ms. Song isn't at home now.

371
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,690
Mr. and Mrs. Song.

372
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,580
Here, have a seat.

373
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,180
Sorry.

374
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,460
It's not cleaned up totally yet.

375
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,620
Here.

376
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,580
Are all janitors that handsome now?

377
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,580
Not just handsome.

378
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,940
I think the lad

379
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,900
looks familiar.

380
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,060
Yeah right.

381
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,220
That's all you say when you see
handsome boys.

382
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,940
Shut it.

383
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,460
I'll take the umbrella, Mrs. Song.

384
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,100
Hello, Mr. Song.

385
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
Not bad.

386
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,980
You clean well.

387
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,360
You cleaned my daughter's place

388
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,580
very well.

389
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,980
It's my job, Mrs. Song.

390
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Don't be modest.

391
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,310
I know how my daughter acts.

392
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,540
More than you do.

393
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,260
If it weren't for you,

394
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,260
this house of hers

395
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,420
would look like a dumpster.

396
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,420
Not bad.

397
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,740
Mrs. Song!

398
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,940
You don't have to do that. I'll take it.

399
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,540
That scared me. Did he get burned?

400
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,580
Um...

401
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,980
Very jumpy.

402
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,820
(Song Xingchen)
We haven't washed our hands yet.

403
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,060
Let's go to the bathroom.

404
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,460
Mrs. Song.

405
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,660
Um...

406
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,180
Mrs. Song!

407
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,020
This bathroom is unavailable for now.

408
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,060
There's some kinks I have to work out.

409
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,020
Hey.

410
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,740
Come here.

411
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,980
You can wash your hands here.

412
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,620
Here.

413
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,670
(Mom: Your dad and I are at your house.)

414
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,140
(The cleaner you hired)

415
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,500
(is quite handsome.)

416
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,980
(When are you coming back?)

417
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,140
Cleaner?

418
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,580
Handsome?

419
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,540
(SOS. Your folks are here.)

420
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,820
Oh no. Oh no, no, no.

421
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,860
Xiaoli.

422
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,540
My home is going to burn down.

423
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,420
I need to go back now.

424
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,980
Go.

425
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,900
Mr. and Mrs. Song.

426
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,460
The bathroom's ready for use.

427
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,700
Um...

428
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,300
Is this your first cleaning gig?

429
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,940
Yeah.

430
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,060
You're diligent.

431
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,180
I guess so.

432
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
When you do your work next time,

433
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,940
don't get too jumpy.

434
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,460
You know,

435
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,100
the two of us

436
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,100
are getting old.

437
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,220
Our hearts aren't as good
as they used to be.

438
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,780
We were scared just now.

439
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,660
Sorry.

440
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,460
I understand.

441
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,260
(That's fast.)

442
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,580
I'll take it.

443
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,780
Tang, you're here.

444
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
Tang is here.

445
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,900
Hey, Tang is here.

446
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Come in.

447
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,700
Come in.

448
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,830
I got this for you, Madam Hu.

449
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,140
Welcome. Come in.

450
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,980
You shouldn't have brought this.

451
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,740
I should.

452
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,300
Um...

453
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,660
Hey.

454
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,340
This is the cleaner Xingchen hired.

455
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,680
What's your name?

456
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,500
Su, Mrs. Song. Just call me Su.

457
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,340
Mr. Song. Su.

458
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,860
Cleaner?

459
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,930
Doesn't look like one, does he?

460
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,260
He's diligent.

461
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,420
And handsome.

462
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,300
I know I'm diligent,

463
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,900
but I don't have to do this.

464
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,340
I know.

465
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,780
You young ones love novelty.

466
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,220
The young people I teach now

467
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,420
like novelty and have no perseverance.

468
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,580
And they're petty.

469
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,620
I don't know if they're petty.

470
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,380
But Mrs. Song,

471
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,900
my grandpa always tells me

472
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,900
that a person
should have a sense of boundaries.

473
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,600
Don't touch
what doesn't belong to you.

474
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,540
Right, Mrs. Song?

475
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,780
Madam Hu.

476
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,700
Do you know what kind of animal

477
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,140
loves setting boundaries?

478
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,300
What?

479
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,260
Dogs.

480
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,780
What are you two talking about?

481
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,780
I have no idea.

482
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,060
Let's go inside, Tang.

483
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,700
Sure.

484
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,780
Get us three cups of tea, Su.

485
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,570
I didn't get in the way of your work

486
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,140
suddenly calling you over, did I?

487
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,220
No.

488
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
I was going to see you and Mr. Song.

489
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,060
Honestly, Xingchen

490
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,780
doesn't know how to take care
of herself.

491
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,660
Good thing you help out.

492
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,780
I have to thank you this time.

493
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,540
No, don't say that.

494
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,450
You know, Xingchen

495
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,340
cares about work too much.

496
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,060
She is a bit lackadaisical about life.

497
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,220
Oh, you're a smooth talker, Tang.

498
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
You can turn all Xingchen's weaknesses

499
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,500
into strengths.

500
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,580
Oh, you flatter me.

501
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,020
You taught well.

502
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,050
See, Xingchen

503
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,420
is so smart and understanding now.

504
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,420
That's no weakness.

505
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,060
What a brown noser.

506
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,260
What'd you say?

507
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,900
Nothing, Mr. Song.

508
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,300
Jianguo.

509
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,100
Look.

510
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,380
Tang's so good.

511
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,180
Compared to the last blind date

512
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,580
Xingchen met,

513
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,900
he's a lot better.

514
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,980
Don't you think so?

515
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,740
Yeah.

516
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,620
You're right.

517
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,300
Blind date?

518
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,380
Yeah.

519
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,940
Xingchen didn't want to go.

520
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,420
I made her.

521
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,300
That blind date

522
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,260
was unreliable.

523
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,700
And he was rude.

524
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,180
Su.

525
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,660
Is the tea done?

526
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,860
Done, Mrs. Song.

527
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,140
Right.

528
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,060
That blind date was Su too.

529
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,980
Su.

530
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,860
I'm not talking about you.

531
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,060
You're good.

532
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:01,870
Thank you.

533
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,350
This is Mr. Song's.

534
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,860
Jianguo.

535
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,380
Come here and have some tea.

536
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,820
Back at the blind date,

537
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,220
out of respect,

538
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,060
he should've controlled his emotions.

539
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,580
So immature of him.

540
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,420
Don't just stand there, Su.

541
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,100
Go do your work.

542
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,740
We have things to talk about.

543
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,620
Sure, Mrs. Song.

544
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,820
Yeah.

545
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,500
Tang, honestly, guys these days

546
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,340
are more princessy than girls.

547
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,460
He got mad because Xingchen

548
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,580
was a few minutes late,
and they got into a fight.

549
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,740
Men should be more mature,

550
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,670
gentlemanly,

551
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,010
and courteous, don't you think?

552
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,320
Yeah.

553
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,060
What's wrong?

554
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,180
Are you alright?

555
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,500
I am.

556
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,220
Just burned myself.

557
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,340
Be careful.

558
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,220
Honestly, Su

559
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,900
makes a mean cup of tea.

560
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,220
Jianguo.

561
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,820
Xingchen is always alone.

562
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,900
We're worried.

563
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,540
If there's someone

564
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,740
who cares for her

565
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,940
and cleans

566
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,380
and cooks

567
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,020
after she gets home, it's great.

568
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,980
I think so too.

569
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,380
Can you come over, Su?

570
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,340
Come over for a bit.

571
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,580
Tuck this vinyl player away.

572
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,540
Yeah, Su.

573
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,860
Of course, Mrs. Song.

574
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,860
Look, you missed a spot here.

575
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,220
Please clean it up.

576
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,820
Su.

577
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,620
Clean it up, please.

578
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,900
Sure.

579
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,100
I just remembered.

580
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,820
Xingchen is allergic to dust.

581
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,540
Su.

582
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
See, there's dust there.

583
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
And this book shelf.

584
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Clean it up, please.

585
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,940
Tang, you're so nice.

586
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,780
You even remember

587
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,420
that Xingchen's allergic to dust.

588
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,140
Here.

589
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,020
Have some tea.

590
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,140
I'm allergic to tea.
I'll have some water.

591
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,020
Whose watch is this?

592
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,580
Why is there a watch here?
Whose watch is it?

593
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,340
It's mine, Mrs. Song.

594
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,420
Yours?

595
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,380
Maybe I left it there

596
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,260
when I was cleaning.

597
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,060
Oh, you're so careless. Take it.

598
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,540
Let me see.

599
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,380
This is a good watch.

600
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,740
Really?

601
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,580
It's worth a car.

602
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,260
No.

603
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,900
Really?

604
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,620
Let me see.

605
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,420
A car?

606
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,580
Lad.

607
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,100
I thought you were working part time

608
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,350
and took up this job.

609
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,140
How do you have an expensive watch
like this?

610
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,740
Mr. and Mrs. Song, this watch is a fake.

611
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,380
It costs a bike at most.

612
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,820
Doesn't look like a fake.

613
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,820
It's a fake.

614
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,900
Oh, you're all here.

615
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,340
Xingchen.

616
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,380
Xingchen.

617
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,900
Is this lad

618
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,500
really a cleaner you hired?

619
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,180
My good friend recommended him.

620
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,860
He works hard.

621
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,740
Look at how clean

622
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,860
he cleans up my place.

623
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,260
It's not bad.

624
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,740
This watch is obviously a fake.

625
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,980
Look at this logo.

626
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,320
It's different from the real deal.

627
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,020
The spelling's wrong.

628
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:22,700
Look.

629
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,220
Let me see.

630
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,540
Right.

631
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,300
Lad.

632
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,620
I have to tell you this.

633
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,540
You're handsome and capable.

634
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,980
You will have a bright future.

635
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,340
You shouldn't wear a fake watch

636
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,940
just for your ego.

637
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,020
That's not good.

638
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,740
Yeah, you're right, Mrs. Song.

639
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,740
Honestly,

640
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,740
not many people are as good
as Tang.

641
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,860
Mom.

642
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,700
Why did you come without telling me?

643
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,060
And you invited a guest.

644
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,700
He's not a guest.

645
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,060
He's like family.

646
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,500
Xingchen.

647
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,740
Tang is so caring.

648
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,940
He remembers, after years,

649
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,380
that you're allergic to dust.

650
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,340
If there's any misunderstanding
before this,

651
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,590
it's water under the bridge now.

652
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,140
Tang.

653
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
Lad.

654
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,100
Why'd you break the flower?

655
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,540
I...

656
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,220
Mom.

657
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,060
I forgot to change the water
of that vase two days ago.

658
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,380
Lots of the petals are wilted.

659
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,740
Change the water now.

660
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,620
Right now.

661
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,260
Xingchen.

662
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,660
I am not saying anything,

663
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,220
but you can't even support yourself.

664
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,460
How can you keep a flower alive?

665
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,540
Tang.

666
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,660
Whenever you're not busy,

667
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,180
come over and visit Xingchen.

668
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,500
Sure.

669
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,380
You go to the bathroom.

670
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,900
I don't want to.

671
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,740
No, you want to.

672
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,500
I'll go to the bathroom.

673
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,020
I'll take him there.

674
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,100
Your folks really think
I'm a cleaner now.

675
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,300
Just promise me one thing,

676
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,980
or I'm not letting you out.

677
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
My folks came over out of the blue.

678
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,500
I have no idea how
to break this to them.

679
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,140
You have to keep it a secret.

680
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,980
Or I'm done for.

681
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,380
Don't worry.

682
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,460
I won't tell your folks

683
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,040
about your relationship with Qingche.

684
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,860
Thanks.

685
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,020
Xingchen, come here.

686
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,940
What did you two talk about?

687
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,260
Nothing.

688
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,140
Xingchen.

689
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,460
You're almost thirty.

690
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,500
I am twenty-nine, Mom.

691
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,460
Yeah, twenty-nine.

692
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
It's my birthday in a couple of days.

693
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,460
I'm another year older.

694
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,500
Don't worry, Mom.

695
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,500
I'll give you a surprise
on your birthday.

696
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,420
An advance happy birthday for you.

697
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,290
You're almost thirty years old.

698
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,900
And you still don't want
to get married.

699
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,070
You think I can be happy?

700
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,220
Xingchen.

701
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,460
Two days ago,

702
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,660
I got a fortune teller

703
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,340
to tell your fate.

704
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,500
You can get married before thirty.

705
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,620
Let me tell my fate.

706
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,420
Okay, the fortune teller's a scam.

707
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,500
Alright, let's not talk about that.

708
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,420
Has anyone asked you out lately?

709
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,780
Besides Xiaoli.

710
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,220
No.

711
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,620
Of course not.

712
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,620
Look at your peers.

713
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,700
They're either married,

714
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,900
or have their own kids.

715
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,260
No one cares about you.

716
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,060
You think I'm not busy?

717
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:13,860
You...

718
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,820
Tang.

719
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,980
Madam Hu.

720
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,180
I am of marriageable age,

721
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,560
(Truth)
I am of marriageable age,

722
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,030
but I'm in no hurry.

723
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,010
(Truth)

724
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,700
You guys are in no hurry?

725
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,980
I am in a big hurry, though.

726
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,900
Why don't you two

727
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,100
just get together?

728
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,700
Any misunderstanding

729
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,140
is water under the bridge.

730
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,660
Mom.

731
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,060
Su.

732
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,980
Why are you so panicked?

733
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,900
Sorry, Mrs. Song.

734
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,740
This book is nice, isn't it?

735
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,380
Truth.

736
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Should be nice.

737
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,170
How about this?

738
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,820
I'll cook.

739
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,060
Today

740
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,180
I got all of Tang's favorites.

741
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,180
Mom.

742
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,540
It's a hassle cooking at home.

743
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,740
Let's eat out.

744
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,460
No can do.

745
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,620
We cannot eat out.

746
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,220
The eateries

747
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,380
use tons of oil.

748
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,380
It's unhealthy.

749
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,360
We don't get to have homecooked
meals everyday.

750
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Recently,

751
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,540
a nice restaurant

752
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,780
opened up beside our place.

753
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,820
Let's give it a try.

754
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,660
Yeah, Madam Hu.

755
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,960
If that's what Xingchen wants,

756
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,980
then we should eat out.

757
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,580
Yeah.

758
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,820
Tang is right.

759
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,800
We have many people today.
The more the merrier.

760
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,820
Let's eat out.

761
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:24,940
Su.

762
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,340
You come with us.

763
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,500
Jianguo.

764
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,180
Why are you butting in?

765
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,380
Look at Su.

766
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,420
He's handsome.

767
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,260
He has to go home to his girlfriend.

768
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,180
It's awkward if he stays here.

769
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,940
Yeah.

770
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,860
You like handsome boys, don't you?

771
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,100
Let him come with us.

772
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,660
What are you talking about?

773
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,790
It's alright.

774
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,060
Su.

775
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,300
The work here is done.

776
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,340
You may go home now.

777
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,380
We'll have this family lunch ourselves.

778
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,580
You go home.

779
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,540
Alright, we're going now.

780
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,780
Who's there?

781
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,940
Xingchen's delivery?

782
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,660
No, it's Mr. Su's delivery.

783
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,140
Mr. Su?

784
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,090
There is no Mr. Su here.

785
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,380
No way. Check the bill.

786
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,100
Here you go.

787
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,660
Oh, it's the correct address.

788
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,140
I know this place. I come here a lot.

789
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,920
I'll put it on the table for you.

790
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,860
Ms. Song, you're here too.

791
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,530
Told you so.

792
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,160
Why are you hiding in the fridge,
Mr. Su?

793
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,760
I'm not Mr. Su.

794
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:39,980
Come on.

795
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,250
I have other deliveries to make.

796
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,100
Just sign it for me.

797
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,300
And whose parent is this?

798
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,900
I normally only see you
and Ms. Song here.

799
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,500
Oh, they must be your in-laws.

800
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,060
You're in a blind date?

801
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,100
Stop talking and leave.

802
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,870
Sorry for the disturbance.

803
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,070
Have a lovely day.

804
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,060
Song Xingchen!

805
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,060
Honestly.

806
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,260
You're already here anyway,

807
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,220
so just tell Xingchen to tell us.

808
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,180
And now,

809
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,660
we're in a mess.

810
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,020
Tang.

811
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,580
You knew this, didn't you?

812
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,020
Where are you going?

813
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,100
What do you think?

814
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,020
Can't you see they don't welcome us?

815
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,700
Go home.

816
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,420
You know Madam Hu's temper.

817
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,380
I'll go persuade her.

818
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,940
Madam Hu.

819
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,180
Madam Hu, calm down.

820
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,340
Tang.

821
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,940
If I hadn't come over out of the blue,

822
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,820
I'd be kept in the dark, wouldn't I?

823
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,940
If you had known

824
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,140
about him dating Xingchen,

825
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,100
why didn't you tell me?

826
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
I thought you were wooing Xingchen.

827
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,220
Madam Hu.

828
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,700
Su Qingche is a decent man.

829
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,820
You can observe him.

830
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,500
You take his side too?

831
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,220
You don't like Xingchen anymore?

832
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,180
I do.

833
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,820
But I believe her judgment.

834
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,740
Tang.

835
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,420
She wanted to treat you to lunch.

836
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,460
Never thought things would
turn out like this.

837
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,500
I trust that Xingchen

838
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,820
didn't hide this on purpose.

839
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,380
She probably didn't find
the right chance

840
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,140
to talk to you.

841
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,020
Yeah, that's true.

842
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,380
Okay.

843
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,860
We'll find a chance,

844
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,500
and I'll talk to Xingchen.

845
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,860
Why don't I give you a ride home?

846
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
No, it's fine.

847
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,260
We got a ride.

848
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,100
We'll find a chance

849
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,260
to gather at home.

850
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:20,940
Sure.

851
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,460
I'll be going, now.

852
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,460
This is a mess.

853
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,140
And I kept praising him

854
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,020
in front of Xingchen.

855
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,300
It's all useless now.

856
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,540
He's a good boy.

857
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,020
What a shame.

858
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,020
Yeah.

859
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,460
Tang isn't bad.

860
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,780
But...

861
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,820
But our girl...

862
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,620
Don't talk to me about her.

863
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,300
It makes my head hurt.

864
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,500
Are you mad, Captain Su?

865
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,300
Nothing to be mad about.

866
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,540
My mom isn't too courteous.

867
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,200
But she didn't mean anything bad.

868
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,700
I should've told them both

869
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,980
about us sooner.

870
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,780
It wouldn't have been this awkward.

871
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,740
I did not think she would invite

872
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,630
Professor Tang without telling me.

873
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,480
I'll explain everything to them
when I go home tonight.

874
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,620
Don't get mad, alright?

875
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,300
I am not mad.

876
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,380
I can understand

877
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,700
that at least for now,

878
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,780
I am not the guy

879
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,180
they like

880
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,460
or can be satisfied with.

881
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,460
However,

882
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,940
everyone

883
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,860
wants to be liked
by their girlfriend's parents.

884
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,220
I know.

885
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,940
But you're good.

886
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,340
My mom just can't see that.

887
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,380
Don't say that.

888
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,860
They just don't know me well enough.

889
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,980
Yeah.

890
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,260
When my mom knows you well enough,

891
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,420
she'll love you.

892
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,580
I'll try to calm her down tonight.

893
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,140
My mom has a hot temper,

894
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,960
but it's alright.
