(Galaxy Mansion, Block C)

25
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,860
Alright, here we are.

26
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,100
Where am I?

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,220
You're home.

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,660
Home?

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,300
Alright, stay put.

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm off.

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,540
What is it?

32
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,820
What's up?

33
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,580
Where are you going?

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,660
Do you know who I am?

35
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,380
Let me tell you.

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,180
Don't even think

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,700
about leaving today.

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm telling you.

39
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,830
I'm not buying the idea
of getting loose after drinking.

40
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,340
Get up.

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,710
Get up.

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,540
Why do you talk so much?

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,940
You won't be able

44
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,900
to escape from my grasp today.

45
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,660
Wait. You...

46
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,340
Xiaoli.

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,420
Don't, Xiao...

48
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:02,820
You!

49
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,820
You!

50
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,140
Why are you in my bed?

51
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,420
How did I...

52
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,150
Why are you in my bed?

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,330
Why do you sleep naked?

54
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,700
I always sleep naked. What's wrong?

55
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,550
I sleep fully clothed.

56
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,300
Who told you to?

57
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,550
Sleeping naked is inappropriate.

58
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,480
You have skin diseases
so you sleep with clothes?

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,300
Don't pass it to me.

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,980
Gentlemen.

61
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,420
Bro.

62
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,740
Both of you are awake.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,530
Someone tell me

64
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,330
why he's here.

65
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,900
You two were fine last night.

66
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,940
Why are you arguing now?

67
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,540
- Who said I was fine with him?
- Who said I was fine with him?

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,060
Don't remember?

69
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,010
I have a video. Do you want to watch it?

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,820
(We can switch players.)

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,220
(It's my turn.)

72
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,300
(I got it.)

73
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,020
(- My buddy
- My buddy)

74
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,860
(- for life.
- for life.)

75
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,140
- Who's your buddy?
- Who's your buddy?

76
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,220
- Delete it.
- Delete it.

77
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,460
Delete it.

78
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,980
Don't move.

79
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,340
Here.

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,660
(Delete)

81
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,820
Qingche, I...

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,420
I already shared it with Xingchen.

83
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,320
- What did you say?
- Sorry.

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,080
You little punk.

85
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,010
Captain Su.

86
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,970
What did you say?

87
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,580
(We can switch players.)

88
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,020
(It's my turn.)

89
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,900
(You deserve
getting dumped by Xingchen.)

90
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,020
(I'm telling you,)

91
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,020
(if you dare to bully her,)

92
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,940
(you'll be dead meat.)

93
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,660
(My buddy)

94
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,100
(Cheers.)

95
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,140
(for life.)

96
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,580
(My buddy)

97
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,620
(Cheers.)

98
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,180
(Cheers.)

99
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,260
How are they now?

100
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,380
(Don't worry, Ms. Song.)

101
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,380
(They're sober now.)

102
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,740
Let's make an agreement

103
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,540
for what happened

104
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,220
last night.

105
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,610
Don't mention it, don't talk about it,
and don't ask about it.

106
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,820
How can we do that?

107
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,860
Why not?

108
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,580
We can only remain as buddies.

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,940
Last night was just an accident.

110
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,260
Since when were we buddies?

111
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,750
Do you want to call us besties, then?

112
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,500
An accident.

113
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,020
Buddies.

114
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Do you really think so?

115
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,140
What? Are you happy?

116
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,140
Rest assured.

117
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,460
I'm also responsible

118
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,700
for what happened last night.

119
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,730
It's not totally your fault.

120
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,380
I'm glad that you're not blaming me,

121
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,540
but shouldn't I take responsibility...

122
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,620
My memory's a bit off today.

123
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,090
I can't recall if I dissed you earlier.

124
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,140
Wait.

125
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,480
Don't you think that your temper

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,220
is beyond expectations?

127
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,620
Anyway, let's put an end to this.

128
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,860
Never bring it up.

129
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,860
We don't click.

130
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,890
If you bring it up again,

131
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,380
you'll risk losing me as a friend.

132
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,340
Fine. As you wish,

133
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,140
let's forget about last night

134
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,100
and go back to how we were before.

135
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,740
We stay as buddies.

136
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,460
Buddies.

137
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,700
Just buddies.

138
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,340
Alright, so, buddy.

139
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,340
Can you...

140
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
Alright. Got it.

141
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,420
Bye.

142
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,780

Stop right there.

What happened?

What happened?

156
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,260
I...

157
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,940
We slept together.

158
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,020
Slept together?

159
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,780
How dare he take advantage of you?

160
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,220
Is he asking for trouble?

161
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,860
No, I...

162
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,540
Let go of me.

163
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,820
I initiated it.

164
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,980
What did you say?

165
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,620
Why the sudden change in attitude?

166
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,300
Do you have feelings for Lu Qun now?

167
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,180
It was just an accident, alright?

168
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,340
Besides,

169
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,260
wouldn't I be asking for trouble

170
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,220
by dating a playboy like him?

171
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,620
But babe,

172
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,700
I'm in a dilemma right now.

173
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,020
I don't know

174
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,980
how to face him moving forward.

175
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,220
See a doctor if you're sick.

176
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,860
Why are you sighing all day long?

177
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,580
Last night

178
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,340
after the celebration dinner,

179
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,940
I sent Han Xiaoli home, didn't I?

180
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,900
We were both drunk,

181
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,060
so we slept together.

182
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,420
Did you really...

183
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,500
Have you thought

184
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,380
about what to do next?

185
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,660
The point is,

186
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,500
it was completely different
from what I envisioned.

187
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,900
She actually proposed

188
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,660
to forget whatever happened last night.

189
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,420
Isn't she a nice girl?

190
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,040
Why can't she let me
take responsibility?

191
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,860
Besides, how can she be so open-minded?

192
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,900
I can't figure it out.

193
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,740

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,420
I didn't expect you'd

209
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,770
become my relationship consultant.

211

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,460
verified the numbers.

380
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,100
Fakes make up at least a third?

381
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,680
Someone complains about us
on the platform.

382
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,790
(Report the unscrupulous businessman)

383
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,340
If this escalates,

384
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,900
it will be out of our control.

385
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,020
What should we do?

386
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,460
They don't pick up our calls.

387
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,620
In that case,

388
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,210
we can only force them to show up.

389
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,900
They mess with us and our customers.

390
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,000
I won't spare them,
even at a financial loss.

391
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,500
Let me.

392
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,180
To provide our esteemed customers
an explanation,

393
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,220
we'll have a blind box livestream
tonight at 8:00 p.m.

394
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,780
All products
are purchased from Yide Trading

395
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,380
and will be sold at cost price.

396
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,420
Blind box?

397
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,580
Will this work?

398
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,900
Won't we be selling fakes?

399
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,540
Only genuine ones are in the boxes.

400
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,340
But we need to create a buzz

401
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,340
to force them to show up.

402
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,860
(After everyone buys it,
we'll have a draw.)

403
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,650
(Redeem it with us
if you get a genuine one.)

404
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,140
(If it's fake, contact the middleman,)

405
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,060
(Yide Trading, for compensation.)

406
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,330
(Remember to file complaints.)

407
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,700
(You'll get ten for every fake.)

408
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,540
(The middleman's address
and phone number)

409
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,060
(are on the product description page.)

410
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,940
(Bookmark it.)

411
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,480
(Customer 1: Now I believe Stardust)

412
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,710
(got tricked by the middleman.)

413
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,860
(Unbelievable.)

414
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,800
(Customer 2: I want to get the fakes.)

415
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
(This way, I can get ten)

416
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,540
(at one's cost price.)

417
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,940
(Customer 3:
Stardust is fighting against fakes.)

418
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,040
(Everyone, let's join them.)

419
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,820
Seems to be working a bit.

420
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,540
But what if
Yide Trading refuses to admit it?

421
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,980
Don't worry.

422
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,180
Those who lack ethics
must be feeling extra guilty.

423
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,590
Once public opinion gets wind of it,

424
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,420
I don't believe they can sit

425
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,340
comfortably anymore.

426
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:26,980
Got it.

427
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,820
(Liang Bin: Tang, take a look
at the notice Song Xingchen posted.)

428
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,060
(She's amazing.)

429
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
(Stardust Rouge's Latest Notice)

430
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,100
(Tang Ruize:
She dealt with the fakes.)

431
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,460
(But it won't end
if she can't find the source.)

432
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,700
(Song Yang: Professor Tang.)

433
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,610
(We've got a lead
on what you're looking into.)

434
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,060
(I'll send you the evidence later.)

435
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,140
Hi.

436
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,660
Is this the Market Supervision Bureau?

437
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,380
It's here.

438
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,260
It's here.

439
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,500
The apology letter is here.

440
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,380
Their wording is smart.

441
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,770
They're shifting the blame
to the manufacturer and delivery.

442
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,310
(Apology Letter)

443
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,100
Anyway, we

444
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,100
taught them a lesson.

445
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,230
Fortunately,

446
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,020
they accept the responsibility
to compensate

447
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,060
for the customers' allergy.

448
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,230
Is the livestream still on?

449
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:56,980
Yes.

450
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,740
We'll sell the remaining genuine ones
at cost price

451
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,870
and explain to our customers.

452
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,580
Okay.

453
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,780
Alright.

454
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,020
Ready?

455
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,940
Yes.

456
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,500
Good.

457
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,580
The four of you are in Lu Qun's group.

458
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,570
We three will be one.

459
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,300
Okay.

460
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,980
- Let's go.
- Okay.

461
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,220
(Disaster Rescue)

462
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,220
Tired?

463
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,500
It's okay.

464
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,820
Why

465
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,980
do I have so many marks on my face?

466
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,140
Are they going to go away, Yizhu?

467
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,620
Yeah.

468
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,340
We nurses often get these.

469
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,740
They will disappear after some time.

470
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,780
Don't scratch it.

471
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,740
Alright.

472
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,860
I still want to date a cute guy.

473
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,020
I can't have scars.

474
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,020
You little fool.

475
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,700
I am not. I'm a little fairy.

476
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,340
Captain Lu.

477
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,420
What's up?

478
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,700
Do you think I'm a little fairy?

479
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:28,820
Yes.

480
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,940
All of you are fairies.

481
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,660
See. Captain Lu says I'm a fairy.

482
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,780
You must be thirsty.

483
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,470
Come. Let's arrange our evening work
with them.

484
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:01,980
What's this?

485
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,140
Eye drops.

486
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,340
I have dry eyes,

487
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,290
so I always carry them.

488
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,340
Your eyes are red.
I'll put some for you.

489
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,220
- No need.
- It's okay.

490
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,500
I said no need.

491
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,940
Did I hurt you?

492
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,020
No.

493
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,460
Sorry.

494
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,630
- Are you okay?
- It's okay.

495
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,580
Let me see it!

496
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,480
Lean down.

497
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,700
I'll put some for you.

498
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,260
Okay.

499
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,180
Roll your eyes.

500
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,780
All done.

501
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,780
Done?

502
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,660
Yeah.

503
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,420
Good job, Mu.

504
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,000
Weiling was all blushed.

505
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,160
Try a little harder.

506
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,430
It's Qixi Festival the day after.

507
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,200
Ask her out.

508
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,500
Don't joke around.

509
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,060
Song Xingchen.

510
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,060
What is it?

511
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,140
Did you report me?

512
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,320
(Haicheng Market Supervision Bureau)

513
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,720
(Notice of Penalty Offenses)

514
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,900
So you're the owner of Yide Trading?

515
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,140
You sell fakes.

516
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,020
How do you
have the nerve to question us?

517
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,500
Right.

518
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
I did mix in some fakes.

519
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,500
But if you don't
provide them with proof,

520
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,500
I can promise

521
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,220
to supply you goods at half the price.

522
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,020
Stardust's profits will come rolling in.

523
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,760
Why make things difficult
for each other?

524
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,820
I didn't report you.

525
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,860
I want you to take responsibility.

526
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Don't push too far.

527
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,340
Leave a way out for others.

528
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,300
Rather than making a fuss here,

529
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,220
perhaps you should focus on your fine.

530
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,660
They're all going to go.

531
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,380
Destroy them now.

532
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,500
Stop!

533
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,980
Professor Tang?

534
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,340
I reported you.

535
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,580
If you want to retaliate, come at me.

536
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,180
LYS chose this obscure shop

537
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,340
for a reason.

538
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,100
LYS chose Stardust Rouge

539
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,490
had nothing to do
with my connection with Xingchen.

540
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,620
Also,

541
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,620
if LYS finds out

542
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,550
that you're mixing in fakes
and causing trouble,

543
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,100
they'll be very glad for their choice.

544
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,940
Song Xingchen, good for you.

545
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,940
You'd better not regret it

546
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,420
and come crying at me, begging.

547
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,060
We'll see.

548
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,740
Bye.

549
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:36,860
How are you?

550
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,740
Are you okay?

551
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,340
Yeah.

552
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,580
Thank you.

553
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,380
It's just a tiny favor.

554
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,300
We're friends.

555
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,900
Perfect timing.

556
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,700
How about I treat you to hot pot later?

557
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,500
Sure.

558
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,540
Let's toast to Professor Tang.

559
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,020
Thank you for helping us out

560
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,440
and saving Stardust from the crisis.

561
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,800
How can I turn a blind eye
when my friends are in trouble?

562
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,340
I'll toast you again.

563
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,460
Thank you for helping us

564
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,580
to catch the source
of fakes at Yide Trading.

565
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,900
Let's dig in.

566
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,900
Smells good.

567
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,380
What should we do
with this batch of goods?

568
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,620
Domestic goods are thriving now,

569
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,500
offering a safer option
than the chaotic foreign market.

570
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,460
We can create a special feature

571
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,540
that
compares leading international brands

572
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,580
with domestic goods,

573
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,850
aiding customers
in discovering the optimal alternatives.

574
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,140
This ensures everyone can choose goods

575
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,570
that are not only more cost-effective

576
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,260
but also safer.

577
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,060
Exactly.

578
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,580
We can also filter out useless products.

579
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,620
Here.

580
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,420
Thanks.

581
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,420
By the way,

582
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,260
how will you spend the day after?

583
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,380
The day after?

584
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,660
Just like usual.

585
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,580
I remember the day after
is Qixi Festival.

586
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,540
I was right.

587
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,420
Will

588
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Su Qingche

589
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,300
prepare any surprises for you?

590
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,300
I don't know.

591
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,580
I just want him to come back safely.

592
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,500
Alright.

593
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,060
I wish everyone a happy holiday

594
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,460
in advance with this hot pot.

595
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,940
Happy holidays.

596
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,180
Happy holidays.

597
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:43,940
Good job.

598
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,700
Captain Su.

599
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,300
Captain Su.

600
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,100
(Disaster Rescue)

601
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,060
(Song Xingchen:
Still busy? How's it going?)

602
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,580
(All wrapped up.
Will be back in two days.)

603
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,860
(How's it over your side?)

604
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,860
(Everything's fine. No need to worry.)

605
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,420
(Let's go to that rooftop restaurant
in two days.)

606
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,780
(I've been wanting to go there.)

607
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,380
(Then, I must...)

608
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,260
Qingche.

609
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,990
A new directive from headquarters.

610
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,960
We're to relocate now.

611
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,660
Now?

612
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,460
Yes.

613
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,500
(Okay.)

614
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:43,980
Let's go.

615
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,820
How are things over their side?

616
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,890
I heard the recent quake
in Hezhou was serious.

617
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,240
The rescue mission must be intense.

618
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,740
He said he should be back in two days.

619
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,030
Actually, I've already
booked the restaurant.

620
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,730
That's great.

621
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,510
Thankfully, Captain Su
is around this time.

622
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,620
At least my presence won't be needed.

623
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

624
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
- Thanks for your effort.
- Thanks for your effort.

625
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,540
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

626
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,820
- Thanks for your effort.
- Thanks for your effort.

627
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,140
(I'm departing now.)

628
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,520
(Will reach the restaurant by six.)

629
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,580
Lu.

630
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,740
Drive as fast as you can

631
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,100
without breaking traffic laws.

632
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,900
She's waiting.

633
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,580
Sure thing.

634
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,340
Sit tight.

(Su Qingche: I'm back in Haicheng.)

652
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,540
(Will head back to the base
for a quick debrief.)

653
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,100
(Okay.)

654
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,270
(I'll head there first.)

655
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,140
(See you there.)

After everyone returns,

659
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,680
rethink everything in our minds

660
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,300
to ensure similar situations
don't happen again.

661
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,940
Thanks for your hard work.

662
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,300
Awesome.

663
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,760
You should get going, too.

664
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,660
Don't keep her waiting.

665
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,180
Got it.

666
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,060
I'm off now.

667
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,300
Bye.

668
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,220
Weiling.

669
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,060
Are you free?

670
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,260
Is something up?

671
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,020
I'd like to invite you for dinner.

672
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Today is Qixi Festival.

673
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,460
Let's go to your favorite restaurant.

674
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,180
Star Kitchen.

675
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,980
How did you know I like that restaurant?

676
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,460
Do you even need to ask?
Qin must've told him.

677
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:51,740
What's wrong?

678
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,900
Nothing.

679
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,060
Why are you everywhere?

680
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,540
Shush.

681
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,340
It's boring alone at home.

682
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,620
I'm not alone at home.

683
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,670
There's someone else?

684
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,220
A guy or a girl?

685
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:06,940
A guy.

686
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,020
My younger brother.

687
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,780
Younger brother?

688
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,180
When did that happen?

689
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,780
I brought it home during the mission.

690
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,940
I'm worried

691
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,660
if it'll eat on time at home alone.

692
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,710
I'll head off first.

693
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,300
Hang on.

694
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,540
Hang on, who is that guy?

695
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,500
Weiling.

696
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,220
Don't bring strangers home.

697
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,100
It's not safe.

698
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,850
How about this?

699
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,200
Bring him along to our dinner.

700
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,680
Let me see what kind of brother he is.

701
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,830
It doesn't eat regular food

702
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,780
but dog food.

703
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,220
Dog food?

704
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,980
That brother you mentioned

705
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,580
is a dog, isn't it?

706
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,340
Yes.

707
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,820
I haven't thought of a name yet.

708
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,420
How about calling it Lin Mu?

709
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,580
That's a good name.

710
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,610
Can't you stop teasing me

711
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,280
- for just one day?
- She left.

712
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,380
Weiling.

713
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,420
Let's go.

714
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,860
Weiling.

715
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,860
Actually, I love dogs.

716
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,220
I'm very caring, really.

717
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,820
Please consider me.

718
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,020
Hello.

719
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,300
This is Polar Night Rescue.

720
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,220
(Hello.)

721
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,660
(We have a missing child here.)

722
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,130
Okay, please calm down.

723
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,020
Provide the address.

724
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,500
(The address is...)

725
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,480
Hello, what's wrong?

726
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,740
Captain Su, we have an urgent report.

727
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,820
Okay.

728
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,630
I'll be right there.

729
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,950
Who else is at the base?

730
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,310
Captain Lu is still in the office.

731
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,470
Notify them to head out.

732
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,900
Send me the address.

733
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,880
(Yintai Mall)

734
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,340
Sorry, Xingchen.

735
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,580
I received an urgent mission.

736
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,820
A child is missing. I need to go.

737
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,100
(Qixi Festival)

738
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,540
Miss, when will your friend arrive?

739
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,940
We need time to prepare the dishes.

740
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,810
Wait a bit longer.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

741
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,740
Excuse me, waiter.

742
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,540
Is that girl over there alone?

743
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,740
She's been here for a while,

744
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,930
but her friend hasn't arrived.

745
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,340
Okay, thanks.

746
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,110
You're welcome.

747
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,820
Don't wander off again.

748
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,980
Listen to your parents.

749
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,740
Your ride is here. Hurry.

750
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,340
Off you go.

751
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,670
Thank you.

752
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,180
It's nothing.

753
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,860
Without you guys,

754
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,080
it would've been unimaginable.

755
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,620
Are you going to run off again?

756
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,320
Don't hit the child.
He's young, after all.

757
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,030
You, are you okay?

758
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,300
Thanks.

759
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,220
Listen to your parents.

760
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,460
Thank you.

761
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,380
Take care.

762
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,460
I need to leave.

763
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,340
Go ahead. I'll wrap up here.

764
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,900
Today's Qixi Festival.

765
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,500
We've got a special show for you.

766
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,940
Happy Qixi Festival.

767
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,260
I love you.

768
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Why are you here?

769
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Don't misunderstand.

770
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,500
Liang Bin called me

771
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,150
and said you were here alone.

772
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,780
Mr. Liang is here, too?

773
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,300
I didn't even notice.

774
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,820
Today's Qixi Festival.

775
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,340
We've got a special show for you.

776
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,940
No, don't get us wrong.

777
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,940
Relax.

778
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,820
Xingchen.

779
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,700
I'll borrow the charm today.

780
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,260
This doesn't mean anything.

781
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,030
No matter where I am,

782
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,900
I'll be there

783
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,980
whenever you need me.

784
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,200
Please take this.

785
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:10,980
