(Stardust Rogue)
Buy one, get three free.

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,480
Xingchen.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,799
We made several orders today.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,240
The future looks promising.

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,319
I filed for arbitration for that guy

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,680
who left a bad review previously.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,040
Aren't you afraid he'll retaliate
against us, complaining again?

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,199
We can't let

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
this kind of guy off easily.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,039
I've noticed

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,360
you've developed a sense of justice,

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,600
like a righteous hero.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,999
Once this stock is cleared,

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,319
we need to plan

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,240
the operation of our store properly.

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,879
Since we've made up our minds,

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,559
we can't let others look down on us,

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,600
thinking we sell junk.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
Let me show you.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,080
(Wishlist)
This plan is so long.

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,959
I was too busy before

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,759
and haven't done many things.

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,839
Now,

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,279
I've listed a wishlist.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,560
I want to accomplish everything
before turning 30.

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,600
Let me see your wishlist.

50
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,880
Learn to surf.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,240
Become a qualified medical volunteer.

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
A medical volunteer?

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,400
Do you still want
to continue being a doctor?

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,839
Being a volunteer is different.

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,959
Do you want to join me?

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
No.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,880
My small frame can't handle it.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,840
Are you really

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,639
not doing it to see the muscular guys?

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,559
You're always watching dramas.

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,440
Look what's in your head?

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,359
Oh no.

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
What happened?

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,599
An account I followed
recommended a drama to me.

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,599
I haven't watched it yet.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,559
Since we're having a break,

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,000
I can catch up with it.

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,960
(Stardust Rogue)

69
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,280
(Stardust Rogue)

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,079
(Stardust Rogue)

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,200
(I really like you.)

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,160
(Could you give me a chance?)

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
(Thank you.)

74
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,000
(But)

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,760
(I can't accept your love.)

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
(Why?)

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,240
(Because...)

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,400
(Because I'm already
a mother of two children.)

79
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,919
This is too melodramatic.

80
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,759
(This can't be real.)

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,999
It's 21st century now.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,119
And this official account
still recommended me this kind of drama.

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Thumbs down.

84
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,360
You came so quickly.

85
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,839
This kind of thing

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,480
should be thrown
into the designated trash bin.

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,879
This kind of intimate clothing

88
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,600
cannot be returned in our store.

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,439
Which intimate clothing have you seen

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,840
that supports returns?

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,559
It seems you have no understanding

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,079
of our industry at all.

93
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,360
It's all prejudice.

94
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,880
What do you mean?

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,119
I just hope you can understand clearly
before spreading rumors.

96
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,559
Selling these products
is not a conduct issue,

97
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,920
but a legitimate business.

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,200
It's you who spread rumors
about my friend, right?

99
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,799
I thought who it was.

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,559
You look decent.

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,159
Saying that girls are expired goods.

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
I think you're the trash here.

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,479
Also,

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,519
you have a girlfriend,
but you still went on blind dates.

105
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,760
You shameless man.

106
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,640
Xiaoli.

107
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,439
Su Qingche.

108
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,039
If you're here to challenge us today,

109
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,680
you've come to the wrong place.

110
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,799
I just feel a bit sorry

111
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,199
for snatching the items
you wanted to buy

112
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
from the supermarket that day.

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,280
If you don't like it,
just throw it away.

114
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
I think you might have misunderstood me.

115
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,040
First, I really don't have a girlfriend.

116
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,079
I never said she's expired goods,
and certainly didn't say your conduct...

117
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,079
I don't want to know.

118
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,679
Let's end this matter here.

119
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,639
We're even now.

120
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,000
Goodbye, I won't see you off.

121
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,840
Morning, Captain Su.

122
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
Captain Su.

123
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
You gone for a run?

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
I'm on duty with Qin today.

125
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,320
We just finished running three miles.

126
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,919
Alright, take a break.

127
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Okay. Let's go.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,640
Qin.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
Qin.

130
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,839
What's wrong?

131
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,039
Qin, do you have asthma?

132
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,400
Yes, medicine.

133
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,599
Hello.

134
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm at Haicheng City Rescue Center.

135
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,319
There's a sudden asthma patient here now.

136
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,120
Qin.

137
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,840
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,080
(Area A: Emergency Room)

139
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
Is she okay?

140
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,120
It's all my fault.

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,399
Qin suffered from overbreathing syndrome

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
due to exhaustion after running.

143
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,439
Actually, covering the nose and mouth

144
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,279
and doing repetitive breathing
can relieve it.

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,559
It's my lack of experience.

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,839
I thought she just had ordinary asthma,

147
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
so I didn't think
in that direction at all.

148
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,479
If we were a bit later...

149
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,080
It's fine. Don't dwell on it.

150
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,800
Emergency treatment requires experience.

151
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,679
We just need more

152
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,040
professional medical training.

153
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,199
You should go back first.

154
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,680
I'll be here with Lu Qun.

155
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,320
You go home. Don't return to the team.

156
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Alright.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're right.

158
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,959
Our medical capabilities
are seriously lacking.

159
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,719
We can't even help our own people
when they're injured.

160
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,759
What should we do?

161
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,439
I was thinking that we should
seek a cooperation with a medical school.

162
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
I'll go and discuss the details.

163
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,280
For this training camp,
first aid courses must be included. Must.

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,320
Don't worry.

165
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
This absolutely must be added.

166
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,440
This is a great opportunity
to expand the team.

167
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,520
(Haicheng University)

168
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
Come in.

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Professor Li, long time no see.

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,520
Xingchen, you're here.

171
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,560
Have a seat.

172
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Xingchen.

173
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,360
I heard that you resigned.

174
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,640
Yes.

175
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,560
You

176
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,799
were a top student
when you were studying.

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,319
But you should also know

178
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,760
how difficult it is
to get into the current medical system.

179
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,639
I was thinking

180
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,080
do you want to become
Professor Zhang's PhD student?

181
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,960
I've been preparing for a long time.

182
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,680
Good for you. I support you.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,599
Professor Zhang's research direction

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,799
is consistent
with your thesis' research direction.

185
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,720
It's very suitable for you.

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
I also think so.

187
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,079
But Professor Li,

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,440
is there anything else
you wanted to tell me today?

189
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,760
I almost forgot.

190
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,799
Here. Take a look at this.

192
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,479
Back in school, you were always talking

193
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,800
about joining the rescue team.

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,000
Now's your chance.

195
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,799
Right now,

196
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,479
they're forming a first aid department

197
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,599
and urgently need instructors.

198
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,760
You're the most suitable.

199
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
A medical volunteer.

200
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,240
This is something I really want to do.

201
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,560
Take a look.

203

Register over there, then gather.

205

(How could it be him?)

209
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,280
It can't be this coincidental, right?

210
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,160
Captain Su.

211
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,799
His physique is amazing. He's so hot.

212
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,279

213
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,800
Are you here to see hot guys?

214
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,559
We're here

215
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,800
for the noble cause of public welfare

216
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,119
- and for hot guys.
- Let's go.

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
- Hurry up and gather.
- Bye.

Hello, I'm an instructor
of the medical team.

Yes.

Hello, I'm Ding Weiling.

223

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,160
I'd like to ask

226
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,960
who was the man just now?

227
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,319
He is the captain
of Haicheng Polar Night Rescue.

228
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
The captain?

229
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,120
Him?

230
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
Captain Su just took over.

231
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,080
What's wrong?

232
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,800
Nothing.

237
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,360
It's a small world, isn't it?

238
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,320
The weather is getting hotter.
I just finished training.

239
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,880
Perfect timing.

240
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,560
Look at you.

241
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,960
Are you training them
or being trained by them?

242
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
You have no idea.

243
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
This batch is exceptional.

244
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,520
Especially her.

245
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,039
A professional doctor
from a renowned hospital.

246
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Also, she's quite pretty.

247
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,039
I evaluate based on professionalism,

248
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,120
not appearance.

249
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
I'm not like you.

250
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
Standby.

251
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,640
The rescue team's mission

252
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,320
is to save as many lives as possible

253
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,560
during disasters.

254
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,360
Through rigorous training,

255
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,080
you'll be equipped

256
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,680
to safeguard both yourselves

257
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,200
and those you rescue

258
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,920
when faced with danger.

259
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
This training course

260
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,240
includes physical fitness,
rope skills, first aid,

261
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,360
and radio communication.

262
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,079
Just because our rescue team

263
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,280
is a charity doesn't mean

264
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680
you can treat it as a game.

265
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,320
The assessment in this training camp

266
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,919
marks the first step toward

267
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,959
becoming a formal member
of the rescue team.

268
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,800
Yes.

269
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,119
The rules and regulations
have been distributed to everyone.

270
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,160
You are volunteers now.

271
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,919
After passing the assessment,
you will become formal members

272
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,919
to take on assured tasks.

273
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,319
Do you all have confidence?

274
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
Yes!

275
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,360
Let's kick off with a basic warm-up

276
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,640
before the official training.

277
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,640
Do a hundred high knee lifts.

278
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Attention!

279
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,960
Ready!

280
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,320
Go!

281
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,600
Stop.

282
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,080
What's your name?

283
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,839
Report, Sir. Xie Yuan.

284
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,720
Xie Yuan.

285
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,680
You can't wear this during training.

286
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,640
Why?

287
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,119
Do you know
what kind of injuries can be caused

288
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,520
by wearing unnecessary accessories
during intense training?

289
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,479
I don't know.

290
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,200
During high-intensity exercises,

291
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,399
a strong impact

292
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
or an accidental fall

293
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,479
might harm yourself

294
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
and the person you're rescuing.

295
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,160
Take it off.

296
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,960
Let me emphasize once more.

297
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,440
I don't expect to see
this kind of unnecessary accessories.

298
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,999
Once you become formal team members,

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,719
I expect not to see items like these

300
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,400
during rescue operations.

301
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,560
Do you understand?

302
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,760
Understood.

303
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,040
After the training,
there will be a contraband check.

304
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,120
Get ready for high knees.

Here are some snacks.

308
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,519
- Here.
- Thank you.

309
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,719
I'm Liu Xinyu.

310
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,959
A sophomore in the medical school.

311
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,680
How should I address you?

312
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,959
I'm Zhou Yiran.

313
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,240
I'm a flight attendant.

314
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,119
I can tell at a glance
from your demeanor and figures.

315
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,240
How about you?

316
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm a doctor. Song Xingchen.

317
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,879
You're my senior.

318
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,080
Nice to meet you.

319
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,079
Surrender all prohibited items

320
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,359
for uniform storage

321
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,880
during the closed training.

322
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
Please cooperate proactively.

323
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,519
Surrender all prohibited items

324
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,039
for uniform storage
during the closed training.

325
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,320
Please cooperate proactively.

326
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,360
Hello, sir.

327
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,000
Ms. Song.

328
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,080
It's been a while.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,080
It's you, Mr. Su.

330
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,920
I didn't recognize you.

331
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,760
What happened?

332
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,080
Did the lingerie business struggle,

333
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,800
making you return to doctor life?

334
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,479
Thanks to you,

335
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,800
our business is thriving.

336
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
Just these?

337
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,880
Yes.

338
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,040
I'm here for training, not a picnic.

339
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,519
Do you need
to personally inspect my room?

340
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,760
No need for that.

341
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,240
But I want to emphasize again.

342
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,879
During the training,

343
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,680
you must adhere
to the rescue team's rules.

344
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,160
No use of prohibited items.

345
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,920
Captain Su.

346
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
Why bother coming here
just to pinpoint my problems?

347
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,560
Are you questioning

348
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,640
the special treatment I provide?

349
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,559
I am a medical team instructor.

350
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm here to train volunteers for you.

351
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,200
Yes.

352
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,520
You are a medical team instructor.

353
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,080
But you are a beginner
in the rescue team.

354
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,920
Is there a problem
with following the rules

355
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,600
during the training with everyone?

356
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,120
No problem.

357
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,119
After the training,

358
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,439
we will return these items

359
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,079
to everyone in their original condition.

360
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,400
During this period,

361
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,279
I hope nobody

362
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,719
uses prohibited items secretly,

363
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,960
causing unnecessary trouble.

364
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,079
Thanks for the cooperation.

365
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,320
- Understood.
- Understood.

366
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,600
What? This is so strict.

367
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,119
Captain Su said

368
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,880
high standards, strict requirements.

369
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,519
(I suppose you won't have time
for me in the next few days.)

370
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,560
(What about the store upgrade?)

371
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,479
You have to take care of that.

372
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,559
The necessary files

373
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,239
are backed up on the studio's computer.

374
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,280
Check it out.

375
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,199
(Alright.)

376
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,560
(Do you think)

377
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,839
(he might be intentionally)

378
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,440
(seeking your attention now?)

379
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,760
I don't think so.

380
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,960
But this is such a coincidence.

381
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,799
Alright, I'll hang up for now.

382
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,560
I'll call you when I have time.

383
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,920
Down.

384
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,800
Up.

385
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Down.

386
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,680
Up.

387
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,960
Down.

388
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,400
Up.

389
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,600
Down.

390
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
Up.

391
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,639
Why does he want us to carry the logs?

392
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,480
Down.

393
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
He shows no mercy at all.

394
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,640
Up.

395
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,040
Stop.

396
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Any problems?

397
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,520
Everyone here is a volunteer.

398
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,239
If you're not interested in training,

399
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,519
I won't push it.

400
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,599
But since you're here,

401
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
you should adhere to the rules

402
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
and follow the instructions.

403
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,119
Understood?

404
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,640
- Understood.
- Understood.

405
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,120
Another thirty times for everyone.

406
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,840
Down.

407
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,679
(Polar Night Rescue.)

408
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,360
(The top brand
of the China Public Welfare Rescue Team.)

409
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,479
(It has been involved)

410
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,440
(in nearly all
major national disaster relief work.)

411
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,080
(As an aspiring young people,)

412
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,000
(my life before the age of twenty-nine)

413
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,200
(was lived according to a set routine.)

414
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,799
(Now, there's an opportunity)

415
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
(to pursue something I've always wanted.)

416
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
(Gao Qingyin)

417
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,040
Hey, Xingchen.

418
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,680
Do you want to have a meal with us?

419
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,920
It's okay. I'm on a diet.

420
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,080
- Let's go.
- Alright.

421
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,760
Hi, Yizhu.

422
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,320
You treat her differently.

423
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
Who?

424
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,120
You know who I'm talking about.

425
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,640
If it were another girl,

426
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,760
you'd likely keep a ten-meter distance.

427
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,920
You're overthinking it.

428
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,840
You're the confused one here.
Do you know that?

429
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Think back to your entire youth.

430
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,119
At that your school, a small place,

431
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,079
did you talk to a girl

432
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,800
for more than three sentences
besides the instructors?

433
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,400
Oh, right.

434
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,160
That neighbor, Gao Qingyin,
doesn't count.

435
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,200
Then again,

436
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,440
why does she look familiar to me?

437
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,120
Refined and gentle medical student.
Remember?

438
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,039
Could she have come

439
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,800
to put an end to your single life?

440
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,240
You touched my hair again.

441
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,999
Still,

442
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,199
why is she always so harsh on you?

443
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,640
What did you do to her?

444
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,160
I'm also curious
about who she really is.

445
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,600
Yizhu.

446
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,639
I heard Captain Lu

447
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,839
spent great efforts
in inviting Captain Su here.

448
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,479
I heard he's
from a high-ranking official's family.

449
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,560
Is that true?

450
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,120
Sort of.

451
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,519
So, does this Captain Su

452
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
have a girlfriend?

453
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,440
It seems not.

454
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,200
Does he have some problem?

455
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,039
What are you thinking all the time?

456
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,200
You're disrespectful.

457
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,759
Did you notice

458
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,959
he maintains a significant distance

459
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,000
from every girl
during the training sessions?

460
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,440
It's very suspicious.

461
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,439
Moreover,

462
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,079
I tried approaching him the other day.

463
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,920
He completely avoids women.

464
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,120
How did you find out?

465
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,439
I knocked on his door late at night,

466
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,400
but he never showed.

467
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,560
So he's gay. He should've told us.

468
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,840
Captain Su conducted a surprise check
for forbidden items.

469
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
214, come out.

470
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,799
Immersion heater

471
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,439
is strictly banned in the dorm.

472
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Be careful next time.

473
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,360
Captain Lu, we won't do it next time.

474
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,760
Are you okay?

475
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,439
- Captain Su, please don't get it wrong...
- Alright. Enough.

476
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,000
Take this and come to my office.

477
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,319
You disregarded training

478
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,880
and even sold goods during training
as a medical consultant.

479
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,119
I said this is for personal use.
I didn't intend to sell anything.

480
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,599
Is there a problem? What's wrong with it?

481
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,640
Can you stay away from me?

482
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,720
What exactly do you want?
If you have an issue with me, say it.

483
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,560
Don't you think you have a problem?

484
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,800
What problem do I have?

485
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,040
The only problem here is your ignorance.

486
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,920
(Diagram Of Organs In The Body)

487
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,360
(Artificial Respiration)

488
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,879
That's all
for the theoretical part of CPR.

489
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,599
Take some time to digest it.

490
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,120
We'll practice next time.

491
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,399
Quiet, everyone.

492
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,440
It seems the power tripped.

493
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll check.

494
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,320
Quiet.

495
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
Did I miss something?

496
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,320
I think I scratched you.

497
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,600
- Let me see.
- No, it's fine.

498
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm okay.

499
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,600
It's late. What's the matter?

500
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Just here to check on your injury.

501
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,200
Did Lu Qun ask you to come?

502
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,200
I came on my own.

503
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,200
Your wound could get infected
and still need to be treated.

504
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,479
It's fine, not a big deal.

505
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,320
Sit down.

506
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,280
Come on.

507
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,000
Take off your top.

508
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,600
What's wrong?

509
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,960
I can't apply the medicine if you don't.

510
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
Isn't taking off clothes a bit much?

511
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,479
If you don't want to get infected,
quit the nonsense.

512
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,000
Otherwise, I'll stay here.

513
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,000
Need my help?

514
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
Let me do it.

515
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
Can you reach your wound?

516
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,360
Don't be fussy. I have a light touch.

517
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm responsible

518
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,560
for your injury.

519
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,320
Sorry for the trouble.

520
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,720
What?

521
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,320
I also want to apologize to you.

522
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,440
I've checked that thing.

523
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,640
It's indeed for face-slimming.

524
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,600
(Face Slimmer)

525
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,720
I'm sorry.

526
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
I was biased against you.

527
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,200
Still, I need to tell you

528
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,799
that it's essentially a stupidity tax

529
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,160
from a scientific perspective.

530
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,599
Do you know the placebo effect
in psychology?

531
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,479
Neurochemical events in the brain,

532
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,239
electrical events,

533
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,159
and the resulting downstream effects

534
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,759
are still effective,
even if it's a placebo.

535
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,640
It's different from a stupidity tax.

536
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,440
What are you doing?

537
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,879
Your nails are too long.

538
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,840
- You might hurt your nail bed.
- Stop.

539
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,960
Are you out of your mind?

540
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,159
In all my years as a doctor,
I've never done nails.

541
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,319
I finally got them done.

542
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,080
How could you?

543
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,200
I didn't mean to scratch you.

544
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,960
Are you seeking revenge?

545
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,079
- Your long nails...
- Stay away.

546
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,559
- will not only hurt yourself...
- Stay away.

547
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,479
- but also easily hurt others.
- Let me go.

548
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,560
- Don't move. I'm almost done.
- Qingche.

549
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,520
Is your Chinese zodiac a dog?

550
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,720
You bit me?

551
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,120
You're more likely a dog.
Maybe even a wolfdog.

552
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,000
What do you mean?

553
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,920
Captain Su.

554
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,599
If you don't like women,

555
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,680
don't touch them.

556
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,880
You said I don't like women?

557
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,720
Do you have a misunderstanding about me?

558
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,520
Really?

559
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,560
Prove it to me.

560
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,600
Prove it.

561
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,200
Prove it.

562
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,160
All bark and no bite.

563
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,120
Gosh, they even meddle in nails.

564
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,200
I don't want
to give them an excuse for it.

565
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,160
But it seems reasonable.

566
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,759
Even if it's just an accessory,

567
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
it's risky during training.

568
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,080
Moreover, I scratched him.

569
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,520
But they didn't
mention this requirement initially.

570
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,919
That's because Captain Su

571
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,959
simply didn't know

572
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,119
all girls in this world

573
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,760
like doing their nails.

574
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,760
That's right.

575
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,559
(Lu Qun)

576
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
(What's going on
between you and Song Xingchen?)

577
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,160
Lu Qun, do you know what this is?

578
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,439
(You're using a beauty device?)

579
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,480
(Do you have to go this far?)

580
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,640

You should have

600
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,640
gone to sleep at this hour, right?

601
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,680
You're not sleeping either.

602
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,220
Practiced it before?

603
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,560
I learned it as a child,

604
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,280
but I haven't practiced for a long time.

605
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,160
Can I try it?

606
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,240
Not bad.

607
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,039
I don't know

608
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,080
what the matchmaker said,

609
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,520
but if it affected you badly,

610
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm sorry for that.

611
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,160
I've known you for a while now.

612
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
You don't seem like a gossipy person.

613
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,000
There's one thing
that I don't understand.

614
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,160
It's so tough here.

615
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,240
Why join the rescue team?

616
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,720
Because I like it.

617
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,520
I wanted to do it before
but didn't have the chance.

618
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,040
So now,

619
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,280
I don't want
to go against my inner wishes anymore.

620
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,680
What do you mean?

621
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,640
Take archery, for example.

622
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,880
I loved it as a child.

623
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,920
But later, for surgical operation job reasons,

624
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
I haven't touched it ever since

625
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,040
for fear of hurting my hands.

626
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,080

635
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,439

make sure you have those documents
ready today.

642
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,800
No problem.

643
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,159
What happened
between you two last night?

644
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,239
Why care so much about it?

645
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,399
She only put medicine on me.

646
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,599
You're dull.

647
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,599
I feel that your springtime is coming.

648
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

649
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,360
You've been acting odd these days.

650
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,839
Your professional habit

651
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,280
keeps you always distant from others.

652
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,279
You're quite close with her, though.

653
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,360
Just mind your own business.

654
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,280
Are you having lunch, Dr. Song?

655
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,759
Captain Su, are you
observing how we're doing?

656
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,559
You're eating too little.
You're today's lecturer.

657
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Eat more.

658
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,880
You have a good memory.

659
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,680
Dr. Song.

660
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,239
The car that helps transport the dummy

661
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,559
had a bit of trouble on its way here.

662
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,960
It'll take a while to arrive.

663
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,319
It'll be too late.
We can't delay our training.

664
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,720
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

665
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,199
Now, I'll teach everyone

666
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,440
the correct procedure
for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

667
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,439
Now, Sun Yizhu and I

668
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,799
will demonstrate it together.

669
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,320
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

670
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,799
Firstly, we need to determine
whether the patient's breathing

671
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,039
and heartbeat have stopped.

672
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,919
Use the most sensitive part of your palm
to feel the heartbeat.

673
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,479
Use your earlobe to feel if the person

674
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,520
is breathing.

675
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,920
The key to performing CPR

676
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,160
is that the compression-to-breath ratio
is 15:1.

677
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,199
Continue for five cycles

678
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,399
in about two minutes

679
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,240
before reassessing the patient.

680
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,279
Blow gently.

681
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,760
Be careful not to blow too hard.

682
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,999
During the process, we need to observe

683
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,879
whether the patient's chest rises.

684
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,319
Then, we need
to perform repeated chest compressions

685
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,399
and artificial respiration.

686
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,280
Make sure to keep an eye
on the patient's real-time response.

687
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,519
Next,

688
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
let's practice in pairs.

689
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,080
Xie Yuan, don't you have a partner?

690
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,240
No, I don't.

691
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,400
Then I'll pair up with you.

692
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,800
Okay.

693
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,960
No, that's not appropriate.

694
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Captain Su.

695
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,159
We're about
to practice artificial respiration.

696
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,520
It requires pairing up.

697
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,160
I know that.

698
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,360
How about you do it?

699
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,480
Me?

700
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,760
It's not a good idea
for both of us, right?

701
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,440
It's not us two. It's you and Xie Yuan.

702
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,720
Patient, are you okay?

703
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,160
He needs resuscitation.

704
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,199
Keep your arms straight.

705
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,120
Press harder. It's 15:1.

706
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,080
Xie Yuan.

707
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,039
I'm talking
about artificial respiration,

708
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,199
not kissing.

709
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,520
Why so nervous?

710
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,120
Okay.

711
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,760
The dummy has arrived.

712
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,200
Here.

713
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,120
Captain Su, did you...

714
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,199
Xie Yuan, the dummy's here.
Practice with it.

715
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,960
Okay.

716
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Continue practicing.

717
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,640
Radio communication is a skill

718
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,999
that every member
of our rescue team must have.

719
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,039
Now, follow the instructions provided

720
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,280
and tune your device
to our team's frequency.

721
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
(Radio Communication
by Polar Night Rescue)

722
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,639
Captain Su.

723
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,879
I still can't get it to work.
Can you help me?

724
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,440
Me too. I can't either.

725
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,800
Yours is working now.

726
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,080
Here.

727
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,760
Hello?

728
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,240
Which frequency are you on?

729
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,080
Are you trying to communicate with aliens?

730
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,919
Hello?

731
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,599
(Hello?)

733
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,240
(Roger.)

734
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,279
No need to hurry, everyone.

735
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,959
It's okay
if you haven't tuned it properly.

736
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,199
After you go back,

737
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,919
refer to the manual given to you.

738
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,879
Get familiar with the frequency tuning
and troubleshooting of your walkie-talkie.

739
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,080
We'll have a test tomorrow.
