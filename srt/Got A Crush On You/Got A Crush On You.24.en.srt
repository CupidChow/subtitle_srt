48
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,340
Okay.

49
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,740
Alright, I got it.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,420
Thank you.

51
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,100
Okay.

52
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,420
Mr. Yang mentioned an issue
with raw materials,

53
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,110
so they can't deliver goods
for some time.

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,020
We'll have

55
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,820
to explain to the customers later.

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,620
We're really unlucky.

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,300
Natural disasters are unavoidable.

58
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,220
Take it easy.
We'll solve it step by step.

59
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,140
Alright. I'll do the explanation.

60
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,980
Hello, Professor.

61
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,420
Can you come to my office today?

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,540
Today?

63
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,780
Today is fine.

64
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,540
But what's the matter?

65
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,850
Come over, and I'll tell you.

66
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,940
I'll be in the office
looking at research materials.

67
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,050
I'll be here until 8:00 p.m.

68
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,180
Alright, I'll see you at school.

69
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,700
What's wrong?

70
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,500
My university professor.

71
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,140
Maybe he wants to talk to me

72
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,480
about next year's Ph.D. exam.

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,390
Go ahead. I'll take care of things here.

74
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,500
Thank you, my bestie.

75
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,540
Sure.

76
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,300
Thank you.

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,140
Bye.

Xingchen.

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,460
I called you here today

81
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,980
to tell you some good news.

82
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,220
Good news?

83
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,020
Is my applied major available

84
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,900
in next year's enrollment plan?

85
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,260
It's about the Ph.D.

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,340
But not next year.

87
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,540
It's this year.

88
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,700

89
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,060
The obstetrics there is world-class.

90
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,580
Do I stand a chance?

91
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,420
Before this,

92
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,860
I sent your information to them.

93
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,900
But I didn't know if it'll work out.

94
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,620
So, I didn't tell you in advance.

95
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,580
Today, they called me,

96
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,420
saying they reviewed your materials

97
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,740
and decided to admit you.

98
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,820
The admission letter
will arrive in a few days.

99
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,140
So, you mean

100
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,010
I don't have to wait until next year?

101
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,710
Exactly.

102
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,430
You don't have to.

103
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,420
Congratulations.

104
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,700
And here

105
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,540
I have

106
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,420
some materials and notes

107
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,500
for your courses.

108
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,460
Take them with you

109
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,550
and get familiar with them.

110
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,340
Professor Li, thank you so much.

111
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,100
Don't worry.

112
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,940
I will definitely not let you down.

113
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,130
When you were studying here,
you were always at the top.

114
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,180
I know you very well.

115
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,540
Xingchen.

116
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,420
This journey will last three years.

117
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,300
This matter is quite sudden.

118
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,060
So,

119
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,380
you don't have much time to prepare.

120
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,500
Understood.

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,740
I will handle it well.

122
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,580
Okay.

123
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,620
Xingchen.

124
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,860
It's really you.

125
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,940
Long time no see.

126
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,540
You came to see Professor Li, right?

127
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,690
We had an employee meeting
this morning,

128
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,460
and I met him.

129
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,930
You finally got what you wanted.

130
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,340
Thank you for what you said

131
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,180
to my mom at my place previously.

132
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,300
How do you know what I said?

133
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,540
At least, she's not meddling
in matchmaking anymore.

134
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
I've figured it out.

135
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,980
As long as you're happy,

136
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm happy too.

137
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,780
In any case,

138
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,140
we are still friends.

139
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,820
I'm also very grateful

140
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,620
for your help with my personal career.

141
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,370
As for matters of the heart,

142
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,080
I believe in giving more than owing.

143
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,830
Otherwise, no amount of compensation
in the future will help.

144
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,740
Let's look ahead,

145
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,860
Professor Tang.

146
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,180
Xingchen.

147
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,900
You have your own pursuits,

148
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,465
and Su Qingche

149
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,770
has his responsibilities
as the captain of the rescue team.

150
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,500
But as a friend,

151
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,860
I need to remind you

152
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,900
to choose and handle things carefully.

153
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,100
Back then, between you and going abroad,

154
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,380
I chose the latter.

155
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,310
You've seen the result.

156
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,100
You've been shooting
since early in the morning,

157
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,490
turning around and around.

158
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,820
If I had known,
I would have stopped you.

159
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,120
I wouldn't have let you take this job.

160
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,260
How many more are left?

161
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,220
Probably five or six more outfits.

162
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,890
And now you caught a cold.

163
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:00,900
It's fine.

164
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,520
If you really can't do it,
I'll help you ask for leave.

165
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,740
It rained heavily yesterday.

166
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,180
And today, it's scorching hot.

167
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,580
Everyone is melting.

168
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,540
It's okay.

169
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,100
Since we promised, just finish it.

170
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,780
You're heating up.

171
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm fine.

172
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,140
I can finish the shoot.

173
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,060
Give it to me.

174
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,380
We brought several sets
of clothes today.

175
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,820
But your car isn't here.

176
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,700
I'll go check.

177
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,420
Later, I'll ask them to send a car

178
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,340
to take us back.

179
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,180
Mengnan.

180
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,340
Don't cause trouble for them.

181
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,780
I'll see if anyone can come
and pick us up.

182
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,540
(Qingche)

183
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,820
(Draft: Qingche)

184
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,860
Having Qingche come to pick us up

185
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,980
seems a bit inappropriate.

186
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,980
If Qingche is not suitable,

187
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,540
you can ask Qiancheng.

188
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,660
Why are you mentioning him again?

189
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,860
Let's just take a taxi home.

190
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,780
Alright.

191
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,810
Okay, Qingyin is here.
Everyone, get ready.

192
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,580
Okay.

193
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,730
It's okay. I can do this.

194
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,300
Qingyin.

195
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,020
Qingyin.

196
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,660
Quick.

197
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,420
Help her get up.

198
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,440
(Haicheng University)

199
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,460
This image
shows the characteristic of light.

200
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,380
Light intensity refers
to the strength or weakness of light.

201
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,660
Look at this image.

202
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,860
The front
is the weak intensity of light,

203
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,510
and the back is the strong intensity.

204
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
In photography,

205
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,590
the higher

206
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,290
(Gao Qingyin: Running a fever again.)
the intensity of ambient light,

207
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,850
the brighter

208
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,260
the subject in the photograph.

209
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,270
The surface color,

210
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,780
texture, and details of the subject

211
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
(Gao Qingyin)
texture, and details of the subject

212
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,510
are also clearer.

213
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,140
(Qiancheng: What's wrong?
Are you okay?)

214
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,460
The lower the light intensity...

215
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,560
(Qiancheng: What's wrong?
Are you okay?)

216
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,700
Didn't I block him?

217
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,420
He's actually

218
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,860
not on my blacklist?

219
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,580
In the previous section,

220
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,420
we introduced
that strong light can cause

221
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,300
the loss of color and details

222
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,470
on the surface of the subject.

223
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,420
Actually,
these two are not contradictory...

224
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,220
Qingyin.

225
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,580
Gao Qingyin.

226
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,660
Gao Qingyin, are you okay?

227
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,220
Gao Qingyin.

228
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,990
(Did something happen to her?)

229
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,740
Qingyin, hold on.

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,790
Qiancheng?

231
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,500
What are you doing?

232
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:05,820
I...

233
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,980
I think my arm is broken.

234
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,060
Broken?

235
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,770
Just a bruise.

236
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,260
Those who don't know

237
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,520
might think you're dying.

238
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,900
Are you sure?

239
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,580
I can't move.

240
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,500
When I was a child, I broke my leg.

241
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,310
Whether it's broken or not,
I would know.

242
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,940
What are you trying to do

243
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
with this act?

244
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,300
I saw your post saying you're sick.

245
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,270
I was worried about you.

246
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,780
I'm fine now.

247
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,900
I've taken medicine.

248
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,620
Good to hear that.

249
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,380
How come I'm still so weak
after training

250
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,340
with Polar Night for a month?

251
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,690
You went to Polar Night?

252
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,430
Why?

253
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,950
You said

254
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,980
Su Qingche and the others
could do everything.

255
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,920
It makes you feel safe.

256
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,660
I don't want to lose to them.

257
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,860
You're different from them.

258
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,830
Why try to be like them?

259
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,220
How am I different?

260
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,980
I can do what they do.

261
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,830
And I can do it even better than them.

262
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,020
And the result?

263
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,840
If you're not up to it,

264
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,050
don't overreach yourself.

265
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,860
You think I'm not as good as Su Qingche.

266
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,340
What are you talking about?

267
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,470
You each have your strengths.

268
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,930
Stop comforting me. I know that.

269
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,940
Alright, let's not talk about this.

270
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm fine. You should go back.

271
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,380
What's the matter?

272
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,140
Why keep avoiding me?

273
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,420
You never returned my calls or messages.

274
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,620
I didn't see or hear them, okay?

275
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,660
What are you afraid of?

276
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,500
I...

277
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,140
Be honest with me.

278
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,100
You're right.

279
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,740
I'm afraid of you.

280
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,900
I've noticed

281
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,380
since that night

282
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,740
you saved me,

283
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,980
my feelings toward you
have been different.

284
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,460
The way you sang

285
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,180
keeps replaying in my mind.

286
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,140
But Mengnan is right.

287
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,700
This is like a backup effect.

288
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,620
I became dependent on you

289
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,660
because I decided
to give up on Qingche.

290
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,100
I have to overcome this.

291
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,660
Or else,

292
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,140
we'll only end up with a tragic outcome.

293
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,810
I'm not worth all the effort
you're putting into me.

294
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,060
Please leave.

295
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,580
Let's not meet again.

296
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,020
Gao Qingyin.

297
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
You silly.

298
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,540
You've already admitted it yourself.

299
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,100
Why force yourself to turn a blind eye?

300
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,540
After the "Half Life" photoshoot,

301
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,500
I was already sure

302
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,380
that I like you.

303
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,730
I talked to Mengnan in private.

304
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,780
I prepare everything

305
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,860
you might need

306
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,700
for your photo shoot

307
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,850
because I worry about you.

308
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,540
I can't ignore all this like you do.

309
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,770
Also, I'm not anyone's replacement.

310
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,520
I don't care if we're suitable or not.

311
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,740
I don't care who you liked before.

312
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,410
I don't care about your relationship
with Song Xingchen

313
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,570
or Su Qingche in the future.

314
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
I just want to tell you

315
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,860
how I feel right now.

316
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,780
I like you.

317
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,980
I just want to be with you.

318
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,300

330
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,220
Okay.

331
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,300
I got it.

332
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,700
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

333
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,020
I appreciate that.

334
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,380
So, can they deliver the products?

335
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,980
Mr. Yang said

336
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,510
several factories
have been making excuses,

337
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,830
citing issues with raw materials,

338
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,320
so they can't send us the products.

339
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,780
Wanru is behind all of this.

340
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,940
It's her again?

341
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,020
Say, why does she keep causing trouble?

342
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,180
I've already paid for the products.

343
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,780
Now I can't get them
nor get the money back.

344
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,680
At this rate,
it'll affect the cash flow.

345
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,620
For now,

346
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,240
let's ship whatever products we can.

347
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,130
Explain the situation
to other customers.

348
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,460
Offer store coupons
for those willing to get a refund.

349
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,790
For those who don't want a refund,

350
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,000
see if they'd like to exchange

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,690
for similar products from other brands

352
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,140
without paying the price difference.

353
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,860
Okay, I'll get it done right away.

354
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,500
What about Wanru, then?

355
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,140
I'll figure out a solution.

356
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,060
Xingchen.

357
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,740
I'm glad you're here.

358
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,300
Xiaoli.

359
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,740
You can't always rely on me.

360
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,620
You need to learn
to handle things yourself.

361
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,340
It's because you're so capable.

362
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,060
Alright, stop it.

363
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,740
If you keep going like this,

364
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,140
how can I focus on my studies
with peace of mind?

365
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,540
Your acceptance letter has arrived?

366
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,540
It should arrive in a couple of days.

367
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,700
That's sudden.

368
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,300
When will you start school then?

369
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,180
I'll start in September this year.

370
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,780
Well...

371
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,540
That's pretty soon.

372
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
So, Xiaoli,

373
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
when I'm not around,

374
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,780
the shop is solely yours.

375
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,900
You're my biggest concern when I'm away.

376
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,140
I need some time to process this.

377
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,540
I'll head home for a bit.

378
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,700
I suddenly recalled

379
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,930
that I have some inventory data

380
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,660
on my home computer

381
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,020
that needs organizing.

382
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,220
Xiaoli.

383
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,820
It's okay. Don't worry.

384
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,060
Let's do it step by step.

385
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,010
It's fine
as long as we get it done by today.

386
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,180
(Unknown number)

387
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,660
Hello?

388
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,900
(Hello, is this Han Xiaoli?)

389
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,780
Yes, I am.

390
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,820
(I'm Wanru.)

391
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,740
What?

392
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,340
You still have the nerve to call me?

393
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,280
(I have a solution
to your current problem.)

394
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,860
(I want to talk to you in person.)

395
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,700
Send me the address.

396
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,780
(Okay.)

397
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,660
You specially asked me out.

398
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,900
Just say what you have to say.

399
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,370
Okay, I'll get straight to the point.

400
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,380
Have you resolved the supply issues

401
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,900
at your company?

402
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,420
What an interesting question.

403
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,700
Even though we had conflicts before,

404
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,550
it was considered
normal business competition.

405
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,370
But don't you think
that you're being sneaky

406
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,740
by doing it behind our backs?

407
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,780
It seems you still don't

408
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,980
understand why I did this.

409
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,940
Aren't you just trying to seek revenge

410
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,980
and get even?

411
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,750
If you think I'm trying to seek revenge,

412
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,220
you're underestimating me.

413
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,500
You want the distribution rights
for LYS?

414
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,340
If it were someone else,

415
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,900
I wouldn't have gone to so much trouble.

416
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,420
But Song Xingchen
is a tough nut to crack,

417
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,540
so I have to do whatever I can.

418
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,020
The distribution rights for LYS

419
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,380
were acquired under our store's name.

420
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,070
If I hand them over to you,

421
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,620
the brand won't be pleased.

422
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,100
I know that.

423
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,540
So, you have only one solution.

424
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,620
Sell your company to me.

425
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,550
You want me to betray Xingchen?

426
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,460
Dream on.

427
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,740
I can wait, but can you?

428
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
If this continues,

429
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,020
you're not the only one
who'll end up losing everything.

430
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,300
This isn't betrayal.

431
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,340
It's giving her an out.

432
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,580
Don't be a burden on your best friend.

433
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,940
I've said what I needed to.

434
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,220
I hope to have your response

435
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,100
by tomorrow morning.

436
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,060
The money can be transferred tomorrow.

437
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,260
Baby.

438
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,980
What are you doing here?

439
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,340
I heard from Ms. Song
that you're off work,

440
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,020
so I came over.

441
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,620
What's wrong with you?

442
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,860
You look preoccupied.

443
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,860
It's nothing.

444
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,500
Let's go.

445
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,340
I'll take you somewhere.

446
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,220
Drown your troubles in booze.

447
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,460
There are only leftovers.

448
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,060
So, I can only make fried rice. Try it.

449
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,540
You can make Teppanyaki, huh?

450
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,660
After I left the army,

451
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,860
I did part-time work here.

452
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,290
The boss here treated me pretty well.

453
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,180
That's some

454
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,460
wide career shift.

455
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,340
Eat while it's hot.

456
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,300
See if it tastes good.

457
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,980
How is it?

458
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,420
It's alright.

459
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,020
So, can you tell me now?

460
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,400
What exactly happened?

461
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,460
Wanru cut off all our supply sources

462
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,140
for the sake of acquiring our store.

463
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,940
Ms. Song wouldn't stand by

464
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,060
and watch, would she?

465
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,020
Xingchen

466
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,900
got her university acceptance letter
yesterday.

467
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,140
It's from a foreign university.

468
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,540
She's leaving in September.

469
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,130
I feel especially scared

470
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,140
that she's leaving.

471
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,570
No wonder Xingchen didn't say anything.

472
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,940
What are you afraid of?

473
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,820
Afraid Wanru will overpower you?

474
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,100
That's not it.

475
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,900
I have no business talent at all.

476
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,940
The store relies entirely on Xingchen.

477
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,860
I don't know what to do

478
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,100
after she leaves.

479
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,580
I suddenly realized

480
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,780
we have something in common.

481
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,260
At one point,

482
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,620
Polar Night
almost crumbled under my management.

483
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,020
Thankfully, Qingche came to the rescue.

484
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,260
Otherwise,

485
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,970
I might have pursued a different career,

486
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,180
like

487
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,060
working as a chef here.

488
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,700
I've come to realize

489
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,780
that mastering anything

490
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,220
demands a significant investment
of time.

491
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,070
Just like this egg fried rice.

492
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,580
I used to think

493
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,860
I could never make it well.

494
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,260
But look,

495
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,820
at least I can make it

496
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,980
to a level you find acceptable.

497
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,500
Don't worry about it.

498
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,300
Even with Ms. Song gone,
you still have me.

499
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,970
Though I'm not good at anything else,

500
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,150
I can at least pack things.

501
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,780
However, our packers

502
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,120
only get eight bucks per hour.

503
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,100
Just eight?

504
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,730
That's not even half the minimum wage.

505
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,620
Really.

506
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,780
So, the other half goes to the meals.

507
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,020
Deal.

508
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,460
Let's high-five.

509
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,140
What day is it today?

510
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,260
We're having steaks.

511
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,460
I've put in all my efforts today,

512
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,500
so no wasting.

513
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,540
You must finish everything.

514
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,780
When have I ever wasted food?

515
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,620
I guess you've got something to tell me.

516
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,260
Yes.

517
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,780
Need my help?

518
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,020
Still,
you didn't have to prepare all this.

519
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,300
You can just tell me.

520
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,980
I'm trying

521
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,300
to express some sincerity, okay?

522
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,700
Seems like it's something big.

523
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,540
Go ahead.

524
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,340
My acceptance letter has arrived.

525
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,440
(Priestley University)

526
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,500
When did this happen?

527
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,430
That's great news.

528
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,030
It just came in yesterday.

529
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,180
But didn't they say

530
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,820
they weren't accepting this year?

531
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,500
It's not the school I applied
to previously.

532
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,380
It's Priestley.

533
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,260
The professor submitted my application.

534
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,500
I don't have to wait till next year.

535
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,870
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

536
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,340
Are you upset?

537
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,050
Why would I?

538
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,060
I'm happy for you.

539
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,240
I've always known

540
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,670
you want to be a great doctor.

541
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,410
It's your life plan.

542
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,730
Yes.

543
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,110
It's all part of the plan.

544
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,770
However, meeting you

545
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,700
was beyond the plan.

546
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,970
Don't change your original life plan

547
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,820
for our unexpected encounter.

548
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,880
Xingchen.

549
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,580
You have the right

550
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,920
to do what you want at any time.

551
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,490
What's wrong?

552
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,640
Back then,

553
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,890
Tang Ruize

554
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,580
made the same decision as I did now.

555
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,380
And now,

556
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,700
I'm where he once stood.

557
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,660
I know what the person who stayed behind

558
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,500
will have to bear.

559
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,340
So?

560
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,860
So, I feel really guilty now.

561
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,820
I don't know if I'm worthy

562
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,980
to offer you a third option.

563
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,260
A third option?

564
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,340
A thirty-second hug

565
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,940
can alleviate a day's stress.

566
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,420
But when we're apart,

567
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,660
I can't immediately

568
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,940
feel your joy or sadness.

569
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,420
When you're stressed,

570
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,660
I can't immediately

571
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,900
offer you a warm hug.

572
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,500
I'll let you know.

573
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,500
We can video chat when we're free.

574
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,590
We can do it every day.

575
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,300
I understand,
but even through video chat,

576
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,860
I can't truly make you feel like

577
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,420
I'm right there beside you.

578
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,220
Right?

579
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,260
No.

580
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,060
Anyway,

581
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,140
I just want you to know

582
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,460
I'll always miss you.

583
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,540
I'll share your joy,

584
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,340
and your sorrow

585
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,500
will deepen mine.

586
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,900
In these three years,

587
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,740
I'll come back whenever there's a break.

588
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,220
Also, I...

589
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,820
Xingchen.

590
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,900
I'll sense your longing.

591
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,660
You don't have to fret.

592
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,700
I won't either.

593
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,260
You'll return.

594
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,350
That doesn't clash
with us being together.

595
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,980
I also agree with your third option.

596
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,580
Although I don't know what it is,

597
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,380
the only thing I know

598
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,100
is neither time

599
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,780
nor distance

600
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,860
can separate us.

601
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,180
Thank you.

602
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,540
If this happened to me,

603
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,060
wouldn't you react the same way?

604
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,460
No.

605
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,580
I'm really leaving.

606
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,300
I'm going

607
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,260
to study abroad.

608
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,940
Don't you...

609
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,140
Don't you feel reluctant
to part with me?

610
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,220
I do feel reluctant.

611
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,940
I honestly do.

612
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,980
How could I not?

613
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,740
When are you leaving?

614
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,260
Next month.

615
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,340
So soon?

616
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,460
I don't know if I'm worthy

617
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,540
to offer you a third option.

618
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,140
Why are you here?

619
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,660
Looks like you and Han Xiaoli

620
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,700
aren't close, actually.

621
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,980
She didn't tell you anything?

622
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,300
Tell me what?

623
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,140
I told her to transfer the store to me.

624
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,540
That's why I'm here to collect it.

625
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,860
Xiaoli won't transfer the store to you.

626
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,370
Your willingness to waste time
doesn't guarantee hers.

627
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,820
This is the right time
to transfer the store.

628
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,420
I won't give up on Stardust.

629
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,380
Just give up.

630
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,380
Are you rejecting me?

631
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,380
Xingchen and I built up Stardust.

632
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,180
There's no way

633
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,380
I'd give it away to anyone,

634
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,590
especially not to you.

635
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,540
I'd like to see

636
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,500
how far you can go.

637
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,180
I'm sorry.

638
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,300
I should've told you.

639
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,940
Fortunately, you didn't abandon me,

640
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,060
or I would've strangled you.

641
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,460
Xingchen.

642
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,500
After this incident,

643
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,860
I've developed an idea.

644
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,500
We've been a platform

645
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,860
that provides selected products

646
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
to our customers.

647
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,580
Why don't we take this chance

648
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,940
and expand our field

649
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,540
by working with our suppliers

650
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,320
and launching
our own designs and products?

651
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,730
Hm?

652
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
So, you want to develop our own brand?

653
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,780
Okay, Ms. Han.

654
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,580
You adapt fast.

655
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,820
What's your plan?

656
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,580
I want to focus on creating products
for middle-aged women.

657
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,620
Come with me.

658
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,740
Look.

659
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,940
Actually, many moms around me

660
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,900
face the same problem.

661
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,900
After childbirth,

662
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,740
they feel depressed
regarding their body.

663
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
The postpartum belly wraps
on the market

664
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,020
aren't that aesthetically pleasing.

665
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,170
So, I was thinking,

666
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,650
why don't we design some ergonomic

667
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,010
and better-looking belly wraps?

668
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,100
Girls are still girls

669
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,980
despite being a mom.

670
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,060
Pursuing beauty

671
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,260
is never wrong at any time.

672
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,140
So, let's give it a try.

673
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,040
Let's do it.

674
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,540
Okay.

675
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,540
(Stardust Rouge)

676
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,060

If I see this online,

685
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,820
I'd definitely place an order.

686
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,580

Ms. Han.

691
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,220
I've prepared the ingredients

692
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,700
for the dishes you want.

693
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,500
Remember,

694
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,480
drop me a WeChat message
before you get off work.

695
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,420
I'll start cooking then.

696
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,700
It'll be ready when you're home.

697
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,360
That's all.

698
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,940
Is this a love letter?

699
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,740
Reading someone's letter

700
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,540
is a violation of privacy, isn't it?

701
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,860
But I'm her boyfriend now,

702
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,940
so I can take a look.

703
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,540
(Wait for your reply. A junior
who has been paying attention to you.)

704
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,820
It really is a love letter.

705
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,140
Fangirling at such a young age.

706
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,860
I think you're very handsome,
and I like you.

707
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,220
I've been paying attention to you.

708
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,460
We can go to the backdoor food street

709
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,940
for chicken cutlet, takoyaki,

710
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,380
and balloon darts.

711
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,060
She likes these.

712
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,140
She's home early.

713
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,620
What are you doing?

714
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,780
Is the meal ready?

715
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,780
Why did you come back suddenly?

716
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,530
I told you to text me
before you come home.

717
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,710
Then, I'll start cooking.

718
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,220
I was busy today.
I didn't pay attention to my phone.

719
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,260
I'm sorry.

720
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,540
It's okay.

721
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,700
I have news.

722
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,860
Xingchen and I
completed a new product design.

723
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,900
It's our first Stardust product,

724
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
launching very soon.

725
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,020
That's great.

726
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,480
That'd free up your schedule, right?

727
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,740
But I'm super hungry now.
I need to be fed.

728
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,580
How about

729
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,410
we go out for a nice meal today?

730
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,680
Where to?

731
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,250
I used to come here often
when I was studying.

732
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,530
How do you know about this place?

733
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,740
Did Xingchen tell you?

734
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,770
It's a secret.

735
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,460
Look, preserved vegetable pancake.

736
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,610
The stall is still here.

737
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,410
(Tea Fragrant)

738
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,590
I used to frequent

739
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,400
this boba shop.

740
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,940
I had at least two cups per day.

741
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,540
It's delicious.

742
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,260
That's impressive.

743
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,700
Boss, one order of chicken cutlet.

744
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,420
How much is it?

745
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,580
Thirteen.

746
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,900
Here you go.

747
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,500
I'll go get something.

00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,140
Sure.

749
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,220
Pick any flavors you want.

750
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
What a variety.

751
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,420
Wait a moment.

752
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,820
It doesn't say here.

753
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,060
I know. One of each flavor, please.

754
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,020
Sure.

755
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,380
Is it nice?

756
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,400
Why did you buy so many?

757
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,750
I'm like an octopus slayer.

758
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,100
You're slim. Eat more.

759
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,060
I want to play this.

760
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,820

Found it between the slits

when I was cleaning the house.

824
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,900
