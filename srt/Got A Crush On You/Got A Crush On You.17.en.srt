=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 17=

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,180
I've arrived.

25
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,750
You'll find me once you come in.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,420
Hello, what can we get you?

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,680
Two cups of latte, please.

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,940
Sure, that'll be 48.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,540
Alright.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,460
Sorry.

31
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,220
It's fine.

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,300
It's you.

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,260
Sorry?

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,700
I saw your videos online.

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,940
The Polar Night Rescue. Am I right?

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,900
Exactly.

37
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,010
It's quite a coincidence.

38
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,580
You look even better in person.

39
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,060
Can I add you on WeChat?

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,820
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,380
It's not really convenient.

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,980
If you're interested in our rescue team,

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,770
you can follow
our official WeChat account.

44
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,080
Thank you for your support.

45
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,540
I've already added that.

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,140
Captain Su, why turn her down?

47
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,020
Here, let me open it for you.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,700
You scan mine.

49
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,940
Xingchen, you...

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,340
Or I can scan you.

51
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,860
This is...

52
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,940
My girlfriend.

53
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,860
Oh, you have a girlfriend.

54
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,660
So sorry.

55
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,020
Your coffee is ready.

56
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,980
Thank you.

57
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,420
Jealous?

58
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,380
Me?

59
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,780
As if.

60
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,780
It's because I know

61
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,900
no matter how many girls
you interact with,

62
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,140
you know I'm still the best.

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,500
She added me.

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,620
Should I accept?

65
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,040
(Erin)

66
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,580
Why not? What's the big deal?

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,860
Will you run away with her?

68
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,510
I'm really going to do it.

69
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,460
See to it yourself.

70
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,280
(Delete)

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,220
That's more like it.

72
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,820
What are you doing?

73
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,780
What's this?

74
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,740
Sniff it.

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,100
Facial mask.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,980
Not bad, you're improving.

77
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,540
Come.

78
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,580
Give it a try.

79
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,980
No, don't give it to me.

80
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,150
Come on, let me try it on you.

81
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,040
No, I'm not doing it.

82
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,460
Who's that?

83
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,380
Let me check.

84
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,340
Who is it?

85
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,900
Qingyin.

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,510
What brings you here?
Are you looking for me?

87
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,700
I'm not here for you.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:47,900
Change...

89
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,940
What brings you here?

90
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,380
I want to talk to you.

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,340
Unrelated people, please leave.

92
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,420
Go on.

93
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,710
I'll head back to the center then.

94
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,460
Sure, go on.

95
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,740
Qiancheng said

96
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,860
you were also
at the paragliding base the other day.

97
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,300
I was.

98
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,100
I came today to give you something.

99
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,940
What is it?

100
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
(To Su Qingche)

101
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,740
What is all this?

102
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,140
These are the love letters

103
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,780
the girls gave Qingche back in school.

104
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,380
I intercepted them all.

105
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,220
Goodness, there's so many of them.

106
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,180
You were quite ruthless.

107
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
No girls are allowed

108
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,180
to lay their hands on the guy I like.

109
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,740
I've kept them all these years.

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,300
Now, they're all yours.

111
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,770
Why are you giving them to me?

112
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,460
Well, Qingche's yours now, isn't he?

113
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,420
But, get this straight.

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,900
I didn't lose.

115
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,420
I gave up on him.

116
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,980
Of course.

117
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Who would turn down

118
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,850
a pretty and outstanding girl like you?

119
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,780
But actually, Qingche's quite fussy.

120
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,340
I think your future will be tough.

121
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,710
Forget about the future.

122
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,480
He always acts like a complete dude now

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,840
that I'm always getting a headache.

124
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Oh, don't even

125
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,980
get me started on that.

126
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,220
Don't rush. We'll chat slowly.

127
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,220
Tell me, what was he like?

128
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,830
You know, once, when I moved,

129
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,260
do you know what

130
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,420
he took my eyelash curler for?

131
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,980
What?

132
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,500
A potato peeler.

133
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,100
He even asked me how to use it

134
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,460
so that he could peel potatoes.

135
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,620
Sounds like something he would do.

136
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,940
Why are you here?

137
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,940
I saw Song Xingchen's Moments post.

138
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,820
She announced your relationship.

139
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,160
I knew you'd be here.

140
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,180
So, I came.

141
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,710
What do you want with me?

142
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,900
I grew up with her,

143
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,700
so she's like a sister to me.

144
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,820
If you dare do anything to her, I'll...

145
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,940
What will you do?

146
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,580
I'll...

147
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,460
I'll tell my great aunt!

148
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,990
Snitch on me, huh?

149
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Don't worry. You won't get the chance.

150
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,210
Good that you have some self-awareness.

151
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,780
I still haven't thanked you
for the photoshoot the other day.

152
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,530
I don't have much to offer you either.

153
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,980
Have some of the beer
Lu Qun keeps here.

154
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,580
Come.

155
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,660
Beer, late at night?

156
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,140
What if you get a beer belly?

157
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,300
So what if a guy has a beer belly?

158
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,540
Just work out.

159
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,000
I really don't get what's so great
about you.

160
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,040
First, Gao Qingyin.

161
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,100
Now, you even have Song Xingchen
in your hands.

162
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,020
What's your secret?

163
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Hey, no poppycock.

164
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,020
Not Gao Qingyin.

165
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,260
I'm not worse-looking than you.

166
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,660
So where's the problem?

167
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,490
Well, I won't look in the mirror
for no reason.

168
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,040
You're actually serious.

169
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,500
Come.

170
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,500
Are you like this even with beer?

171
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm not good with alcohol.

172
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,300
You need training then. Come.

173
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,220
Again?

174
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,900
Tell me about your aunt's childhood.

175
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,220
Look.

176
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,780
Song Xingchen has always been a queen
growing up.

177
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,490
She always bullied me.

178
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,780
Don't lie.

179
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,460
She's so cute.

180
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,820
How could she have been a bully?

181
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,460
Look at how she tugged my ear.

182
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,620
It's bigger than my face.

183
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,260
That was on you.
You must've annoyed her.

184
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,940
Served you right.

185
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Served me right?

186
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,220
If it wasn't that she grew up pretty,

187
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,680
she wouldn't look like a girl at all!

188
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,130
Good-looking girls grew up pretty.

189
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,460
Give it to me.

190
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,780
Come on, don't. Are there more?

191
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,420
Do you have other photos? Show me.

192
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,940
The theme park.

193
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,220
This one.

194
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,980
In the bath.

195
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,100
You kept this?

196
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,660
She bathed me.

197
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,060
I'm the one naked.

198
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,780
Send it to me.

199
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,180
Sure.

200
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,860
I hope when you read this letter,

201
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,220
you won't find it strange.

202
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,420
It's just from someone

203
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,340
who has secretly liked you
for many years...

204
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,700
No, stop reading,

205
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,220
please.

206
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,780
I hesitated...

207
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,380
This...

208
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,490
I don't even know

209
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,980
half of these people. I swear.

210
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,610
Why are you so nervous?

211
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,820
I'm not.

212
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,000
Won't you be nervous if it were you?

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,380
Of course not.

214
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,140
If these were mine,

215
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,380
I would feel accomplished.

216
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,780
And maybe a little regret.

217
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,500
Honestly, though,

218
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,300
Gao Qingyin intercepted
many of your crushes.

219
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,780
Shouldn't you thank her?

220
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,300
Come clean.

221
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,860
Do you feel a little accomplished?

222
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,140
Like you,

223
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,380
a little.

224
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,860
Just "a little"?

225
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,980
But I really don't know them.

226
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,020
Most of the people...

227
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,140
Alright, no need to explain.

228
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,860
I'm going

229
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,220
to store them away properly.

230
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,620
After all, these are your trophies.

231
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,940
What do you mean by "my trophies"?

232
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,500
At most, they're Gao Qingyin's trophies.

233
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,100
No. They're mine now.

234
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,140
The more reason for me
to store them properly.

235
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,100
Qingyin, have some water.

236
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,940
We're done for the day, right?

237
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,460
I want to go back and rest.

238
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,580
You need to have dinner

239
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,020
with a boss tonight.

240
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,180
What dinner?

241
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:41,900
I won't go.

242
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,500
No, Qingyin. We have to go.

243
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,860
All of our upcoming shoots

244
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,540
are sponsored by his company.

245
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,420
Alright. I'll go to the washroom

246
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,860
while you buy some refreshments

247
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,420
for the on-site crew.

248
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,820
No problem.

249
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
- It's you.
- It's you.

250
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,100
Why are you here?

251
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,660
I'm here for a shoot.

252
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,180
Where's the school's back gate?

253
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,980
I need to leave.

254
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,020
Why?

255
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,860
Mengnan.

256
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,140
She wants me to dine with the investor.

257
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,490
I need to slip away quickly.

258
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,620
Alright, I'll take you somewhere else.

259
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,580
Where?

260
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,580
You'll find out.

261
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
(Mengnan, I have a bad tummy,)

262
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,900
(so I'll be heading home.)

263
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,700
(About the dinner,)

264
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,690
(please apologize to the boss for me.)

265
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,180
Super-awesome noodles.

266
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,820
You brought me here
just to eat beef noodles?

267
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,340
Don't underestimate this place.

268
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,340
I'll have you know

269
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,700
that they have the best noodles
in all of Haicheng City.

270
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,420
Is the boss here a slash?

271
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,420
How would I know?

272
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,420
Is it just the two of us?

273
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,580
You can invite some friends.

274
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,900
No need for that.

275
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,340
Alright.

276
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,900
How is it?

277
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,340
It's pretty good.

278
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,340
You can handle spicy food
better than me.

279
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,510
I can't handle spicy food.

280
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,100
I heard

281
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,300
you made up with Song Xingchen.

282
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
I had a women's talk with her.

283
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,020
Is my seniority higher than you now?

284
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,980
Dream on.

285
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,320
Excuse me, here's your beverage.

286
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,820
Thank you.

287
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,860
Qingyin.

288
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,660
My, it's really you.

289
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,300
What a coincidence, Mr. Yuan.

290
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,570
I saw you outside just now

291
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,880
and thought I was seeing things.

292
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,110
Haven't you gone home
because of an upset stomach?

293
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,040
What are you doing here?

294
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm fine now after taking some medicine.

295
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,540
Alright.

296
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,940
Come, let's go to our room.

297
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,820
This is...

298
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,780
He's my friend.

299
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,100
Join us then.

300
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
It must be boring here,
with just you two.

301
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,140
Come.

302
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,740
It's fine. We'll be leaving soon.

303
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,710
You guys have fun.

304
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,660
Wait, are you avoiding us?

305
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,180
Don't you want to hang out with us?

306
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,450
Your stomachache isn't some excuse,
is it?

307
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,260
No, I'm actually not feeling well...

308
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,740
Mr. Yuan.

309
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,660
Since you insist,

310
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,220
we should join you.

311
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,060
Why don't you lead the way?

312
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,660
Come.

313
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,060
What are you doing?

314
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,500
Do you know how they drink?

315
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,700
Do we have to drink with them?

316
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,500
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

317
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,220
Let's go.

318
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,580
Ms. Yan.

319
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,500
A toast to you.

320
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,780
I'll empty it. Be my guest.

321
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,340
You have too little in your glass.

322
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,510
Come, I'll fill it up for you.

323
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,980
Ms. Yan, look who's here.

324
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Qingyin, you've come.

325
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,260
Ms. Yan, I'll drink this one for her.

326
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,980
Cheers.

327
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,530
Alright.

328
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,140
Come, sit.

329
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,270
Let's all join the fun.

330
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,900
Drink up.

331
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,410
Looks like Qingyin has a pretty good
alcohol tolerance.

332
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,220
Qingyin, since you're here,

333
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,800
sing a song for Ms. Yan.

334
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,780
Yeah, Qingyin, sing a song.

335
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,260
Well, maybe not.

336
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,820
You guys go ahead. I won't.

337
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,300
Why not?

338
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,140
What will you sing?

339
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,520
Add one to the list for Qingyin.

340
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,950
How boring it'd be to sing alone.

341
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,220
I'll sing with Qingyin.

342
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,740
This is...

343
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,220
Ms. Yan, this is Qingyin's friend.

344
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,460
Ms. Yan, this is my friend, Qiancheng.

345
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,340
Come on.

346
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,550
Come, a round of applause.

347
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,340
A round of applause.

348
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,260
What are you doing?

349
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,890
What do you have in mind?

350
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,260
Stop!

351
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Gao.

352
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,100
How about we stop singing

353
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
and have some food?

354
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,500
That won't do.

355
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,420
We've come to entertain Ms. Yan.

356
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,260
Yeah.

357
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,340
Qingyin.

358
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,340
Mr. Yuan's right.

359
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,620
Your singing is

360
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,020
amazing.

361
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,500
How about you two sing first

362
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,110
while I go out for a smoke?

363
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,380
Qingyin, what are you doing?

364
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,820
They're the client.

365
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,840
I'm singing, of course.

366
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,070
So what if they are the client?

367
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,900
I...

368
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,400
I'm done talking to you.
I'll head out first.

369
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,780
Well, now that everyone's left,

370
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,700
this next song is for you.

371
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,700
Okay.

372
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,220
♪If tomorrow is another sunny day♪

373
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,260
♪Shall we make a date at this moment♪

374
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,100

380
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,620
Why am I thinking of him again?

381
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,340
How did he cross my mind again?

382
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,500
But he's really handsome.

383
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,660
Why does he seem
more handsome than Qingche?

384
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,300
No, Qingyin.

385
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,260
How could I fall for the nephew

386
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,060
of my future sister-in-law,
my former rival?

387
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,220
Wouldn't that make me her junior?

388
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,340
Weiling.

389
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,780
Xiaoli.

390
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,900
You're here.

391
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,040
Are you the only one here today?

392
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,090
Captain Su took the others out,

393
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,520
but Captain Lu and Zhou Yao are here.

394
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,660
I happened to pass by

395
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,980
and thought I should say hi.

396
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,700
Here.

397
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,180
Xiaoli.

398
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
What brings you here?

399
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,140
See, Captain Lu comes out immediately.

400
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,060
You guys chat.

401
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,780
Thanks for these.

402
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,100
Why are you here?

403
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,020
I happened to be shopping nearby,

404
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,830
and I thought I'd bring you guys
some snacks.

405
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,100
Thanks.

406
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,500
That means you're available today,
right?

407
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,100
How about a movie tonight?

408
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,620
I have two great films in mind.

409
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,900
Tonight?

410
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,700
I can't. I have to catch up on my shows.

411
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,940
I see.

412
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,500
Captain Lu.

413
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,790
You're not hitting on Xiaoli, are you?

414
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
No. How can I?

415
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,140
A friend gave me two movie tickets.

416
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
I'm just asking casually.

417
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,940
I was supposed

418
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,020
to go with Zhou Yao initially.

419
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,170
Zhou Yao.

420
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,210
Are you going to the movies
with Captain Lu tonight?

421
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,660
The movies?

422
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,100
Yes, the movies.

423
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,940
Zhou Yao,
I have another set of training to do.

424
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,220
Quick.

425
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,740
- One more set.
- No.

426
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,980
You can watch your drama anytime,

427
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,260
but a movie has its time period, right?

428
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,660
Touche.

429
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,610
Let me answer Captain Su's call.

430
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,060
Alright.

431
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,740
Hey, Captain Su.

432
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,420
Tell me.

433
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,860
Were you trying to ask Xiaoli out

434
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,860
but failed?

435
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,710
Have I ever failed to ask anyone out?

436
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,940
My plan got canceled.

437
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,500
I was just asking casually.

438
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,300
You can fool others, but not me.

439
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,660
I saw through you
during Stardust's renovation.

440
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,060
I approached her

441
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,530
only because of Captain Su.

442
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,870
Think about it.

443
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,900
She's Xingchen's best friend.

444
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,340
If I become friends with her,

445
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,220
I'll have infiltrated the enemy's ranks.

446
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,820
I'm sacrificing charm
and dignity for my brother.

447
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,580
Are you now?

448
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,260
Shall I present you

449
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,420
with the Best Bro Award?

450
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,460
She heard you. Chase after her, Lu!

451
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,980
A master never chases at this moment.

452
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Note that down.

453
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,220
Alright.

454
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,300
Hey, has someone gotten their head stuck?

455
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,900
Don't worry. I'll handle it right away.

456
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,220
Wait for me. Don't panic, alright?

457
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,780
Xiaoli.

458
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,060
Xiaoli!

459
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,500
It's not what you think.

460
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I can explain.

461
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,150
There's nothing to explain.

462
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,500
You wanted to help Su Qingche
to pursue Xingchen, no?

463
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,340
Now that they've become a thing,

464
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,660
you can drop it now.

465
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,940
Xiaoli.

466
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,220
Oh, look at me.

467
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,620
I'm dumb with words.

468
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,100
Zhou Yao is my sidekick,

469
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,460
and I wanted that boost of ego.

470
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,980
I worry they'll talk behind my back.

471
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,180
I should apologize to you, then.

472
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,020
I've ruined your moment.

473
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,580
No.

474
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,620
No.

475
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,620
Captain Lu.

476
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,580
Didn't you say someone's head got stuck,

477
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,140
and you need to save them?

478
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,220
It was my head that got stuck.

479
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,140
Come.

480
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,900
Qun.

481
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,870
You might not like
what I'm about to say,

482
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,740
but you can't fool others.

483
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,540
You've developed feelings for Xiaoli.

484
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,110
You can't shut up
even when you're out, huh?

485
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,860
Are you bored?

486
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,860
I'll get more guys.

487
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,980
Don't.

488
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,100
What you need to do now

489
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,860
is to clarify things with Xiaoli.

490
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,380
Me? No need.

491
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,220
Alright.

492
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,100
Even if you don't have feelings for her,

493
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,340
and she doesn't like you, either,

494
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
anyone who heard you

495
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,980
would still feel hurt, right?

496
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,580
You often teach me how to approach

497
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,380
and chat with girls.

498
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,900
You're indeed skilled,

499
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,300
but think about it.

500
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,460
Were you ever serious?

501
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,540
So many times after drinking,

502
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,340
you couldn't even remember their names.

503
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,460
Right?

504
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,980
Think about your tone and attitude

505
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,220
toward Xiaoli.

506
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,060
You care about her.

507
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,020
When was the last time
you drank like this

508
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,180
because of a girl?

509
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,820
Maybe you really first approached her

510
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,700
in the escape room

511
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,420
because of Captain Su.

512
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,700
What about now?

513
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,900
You have a point.

514
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,380
My words were hurtful

515
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,700
regardless of my feelings for her.

516
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,700
One day,

517
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,100
I'll clear things up with her.

518
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,220
One day? Why wait?

519
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,020
Do it now.

520
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,940
Come.

521
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,300
- Now?
- Yes.

522
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,300
Why wait?

523
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,500
Go.

524
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,180
Alright.

525
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,100
Server!

526
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,580
Forget it. It's on me.

527
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,060
Just take me out with you next time.

528
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Thanks, buddy.

529
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,580
Xiaoli.

530
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,140
I...

531
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,180
Xiaoli, I'm sorry.

532
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,660
I didn't mean what I said.

533
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,220
I'll come clean.

534
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,700
I indeed approached you

535
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,100
for Qingche.

536
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,380
But, as you said,

537
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,820
they're already dating,

538
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,420
so I don't need to keep this up anymore.

539
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,900
I just think you're a nice girl,

540
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,250
and I want to be friends with you.

541
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,780
Xiaoli, hear me out. Xiaoli.

542
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,100
See that?

543
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,780
Square dancing?

544
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,340
Go and dance with them,

545
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,040
then I'll think about it.

546
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,780
Thank you, everyone.

547
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,020
You dance well, kid.

548
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,700
Do you want to join our team?

549
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,100
You're pretty good-looking too.

550
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,180
Do you have a girlfriend?

551
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,540
Yes.

552
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,100
What's your job?

553
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,200
What's your horoscope?

554
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,260
Everyone,

555
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,300
I'm Lu Qun,

556
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,140
a member of the Polar Night Rescue.

557
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,740
Is it the one that recently organized

558
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,020
the self-defense event?

559
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,300
Yes, that's us.

560
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,660
Besides organizing activities,

561
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,220
we also engage in social rescue.

562
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,280
You can reach out to us
for any emergency.

563
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,660
The most important thing is

564
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,530
it's absolutely free.

565
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,020
Free of charge.

566
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,180
Come, everyone, scan our QR code,

567
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,540
and you'll reach us.

568
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,140
Yes.

569
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,020
Come.

570
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,900
Come, scan here.

571
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,300
Of course,

572
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,380
I don't wish anyone to be in danger,

573
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,540
but if you ever are and reach out to us,

574
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,780
we will immediately come

575
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,460
and rescue you.

576
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,140
Let's practice our slogan, okay?

577
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,500
Polar Night Rescue, march forward bravely.

578
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,860
- Polar Night Rescue, march forward bravely.
- Polar Night Rescue, march forward bravely.

579
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,060
Fear no danger,
charge to the front.

580
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,260
- Fear no danger, charge to the front.
- Fear no danger, charge to the front.

581
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,340
Polar Night Rescue,
march forward bravely.

(One month later)

591
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,460
(Stardust Rouge)

592
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,900
Come, cheers.

593
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,400
Congrats to the two bosses of Stardust.

594
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,820
May your profits keep rolling in
and your business peak.

595
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,500
Our store is finally profiting.

596
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,540
Our hard work has finally paid off.

597
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,420
If we keep this up, I can pay you back.

598
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,780
One day,

599
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,300
I'll become a super rich lady,

600
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,500
and I can date a hottie!

601
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,460
I think that's possible.

602
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,940
What's so good about a hot guy?

603
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,980
Character matters more.

604
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,300
I like hotties...

605
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,820
Alright, enough, you two.

606
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,820
- Cheers.
- Congrats.

607
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,100
Mr. Liang.

608
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,860
I'm delighted you could come.

609
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,380
Xiaoli.

610
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,100
Congrats, Ms. Song.

611
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,820
Although I didn't bring a gift today,

612
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,420
I had the legal team

613
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,020
prepare a year's agency contract.

614
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,180
What a substantial gift.
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

615
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,620
I will not let you down.

616
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,340
I have high hopes.

617
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,180
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

618
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,900
Everyone, please enjoy yourselves.

619
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,700
Allow me to settle the other table first.

620
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,060
Xingchen, sorry for being late.

621
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,220
Congrats.

622
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,660
Your favorite white tulips.

623
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,540
Thank you. It symbolizes blessings.

624
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,430
Thanks, Professor Tang.

625
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,660
But why are you here?

626
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,860
After all,
I've known Xingchen for years.

627
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,350
I must come and congratulate her.

628
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,180
Have a seat.

629
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,040
I'll go entertain Mr. Liang.

630
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,220
- Go ahead.
- Wait for me.

631
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,140
Come, everyone, let's raise our glasses.

632
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,420
It's thanks to all you elites
and leaders present

633
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,620
that we can achieve the leading sales
today.

634
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,540
Xingchen and I
would like to toast everyone.

635
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,060
Cheers.

636
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,710
The one proposing the toast
should drink three glasses.

637
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,950
You have to finish them, then.

638
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,150
What are you drinking?

639
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,630
Everyone, a pleasure working with you.

640
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,080
Pleasure.

641
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,740
Ms. Song, for our collaboration,

642
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,820
you must finish this glass.

643
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,260
Certainly.

644
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,220
Come on.

645
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,050
She can't drink a lot.

646
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,340
I'll drink this for her.

647
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,660
No need.

648
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,700
I'll handle Ms. Song's drink for her.

649
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,100
Professor Tang drank quite a bit.

650
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,110
Let him rest for a while.

651
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,420
Come.

652
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,660
Let me toast everyone, Mr. Liang.

653
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,300
Nice to meet you.

654
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,140
Cheers.

655
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,620
- Bottoms up.
- Alright.

656
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,860
You sure can drink.

657
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,340
Since we're having so much fun today.

658
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,940
How about we play a drinking game?

659
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,180
Sure.

660
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:14,980
Will you play?

661
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,300
Let's do it.

662
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,260
Do you know what I hate most about you?

663
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,100
Arrogant, conceit,

664
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,700
and self-righteous.

665
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,980
Too obsessive

666
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,860
and can't see the picture.

667
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,820
See you at the end.

668
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,140
I'll go to the washroom.

669
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,810
Will you have another glass?

670
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,620
Are you scared?

671
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,740
Let me tell you,

672
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,260
I, Su Qingche, have never been afraid.

673
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,500
Su.

674
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,140
I shouldn't say this,

675
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,220
but her parents have long

676
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,140
considered me as her boyfriend

677
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,620
and even her future husband.

678
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,500
What did I tell you earlier?

679
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,500
Too obsessive.

680
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,580
I have another few words for you.

681
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,380
Know your limits.

682
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,420
Know when to stop.

683
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,780
I'm warning you.

684
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,860
If you dare betray her,

685
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,420
I won't spare you.

686
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,380
You guys cheated. That can't count.

687
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,020
You guys cheated.

688
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,940
Captain Lu.

689
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,460
Captain Lu.

690
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,140
Alright, I'll set an example.

691
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,380
I choose truth.

692
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,900
Okay.

693
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,300
Okay.

694
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,740
Alright.

695
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,410
Who wants to ask?

696
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,100
Who will it be?

697
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,100
I'll do it.

698
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,580
Alright.

699
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,780
Captain Lu.

700
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:35,930
When will you

701
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,500
introduce your girlfriend to us?

702
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,140
Yeah.

703
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,740
- Right?
- Yeah.

704
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,900
Actually,

705
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,460
I already have a kid.

706
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,340
Meaning I've settled down.

707
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,540
I don't need a girlfriend.

708
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,500
Did you know?

709
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,740
No.

710
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,020
When?

711
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,020
With whom?

712
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,900
Actually, our Polar Night Rescue Team

713
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,140
is like my child.

714
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,980
For this "child",

715
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,340
I've put in a lot of effort, I swear.

716
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,300
It's like my own child.

717
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,300
So between you and Su Qingche,
who's the mom and who's the dad?

718
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,980
Well, you can definitely tell
I'm the dad, right?

719
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,740
How could I possibly be the mom?

720
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,060
Mommy Lu.

721
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
- You...
- You can also do this.

722
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,980
Xiaoli, where are they?

723
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,660
They're in the washroom.

724
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,930
I'll pay the bill.

725
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,940
She's mine.

726
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,500
Got it?

727
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,740
You had no chance.

728
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
What is up with you two?

729
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,220
I could hear you yelling

730
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,260
in the corridor.

731
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,340
I don't think Professor Tang

732
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,900
drank liquor.

733
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,380
He drank gunpowder.

734
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,540
He started it.

735
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,100
What, are you scared?

736
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,060
Drink!

737
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,660
Come on!

738
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,260
Let's go!

739
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:00,860
Let's go!

740
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,900
Keep it down, you two.

741
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,180
This is a public place. Have some shame.

742
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,810
There's no one else here.

743
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,700
One's my boyfriend,

744
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,100
the other's my dad's apprentice.

745
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,100
Now, swear not to be at odds
with each other.

746
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,820
If he stays away from me,
I won't go to him.

747
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
I will only go to him if he comes at me.

748
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,860
That's it. I'm leaving.

749
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,220
Xingchen.

750
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,500
Are we continuing to drink?

751
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,140
Why did it end so quickly?

752
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,300
Slow down.

753
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,420
Wait for them.

754
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,220
Wait.

755
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,620
All okay?

756
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,820
Lin Mu, Zhou Yao.

757
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,940
Help me settle them.

758
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,450
Don't worry, Ms. Song.

759
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,100
We do this all the time.

760
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,820
Thanks, guys.

761
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,780
Xiaoli.

762
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,300
I'll take her home.

763
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,700
You two stay too far apart.
Mine's closer.

764
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,460
Don't hit on her.

765
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,380
How could I? No way.

766
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,530
Don't worry. We'll go for another round!

767
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,050
I'm heading the same way with Ms. Song.

768
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,540
Slow down.

769
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,100
I'll leave it to you guys.

770
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,580
Don't worry.

771
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,420
- Bye.
- Bye.

772
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Stay safe.

773
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,880
Will you admit defeat?

774
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,020
No.

775
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,600
Let's continue drinking.

776
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,540
Alright.

777
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,060
I will make you yield.

778
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,540
Come at me then.

779
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,500
- Let's go.
- Come on.

780
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,740
Hey, you two, slow down.

781
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,380
Alright, here we are.

782
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,220
Where am I?

783
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,380
You're home.

784
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,060
Home?

785
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,460
Alright, stay put.

786
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,580
I'm off.

787
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,660
