(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 13=

24
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,240
You lost.

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,974
Watch out for your image.

26
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:51,820
Someone is recording.

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,900
Got it?

28
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,260
All is fair in war. You got distracted.

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,460
Got it.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,500
You better not cross the line.

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
How's my move?

32
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,100
Qingyin, do you really have to do this?

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,620
I've decided to give it another try.

34
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,900
Good afternoon, everyone.

35
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,420
Qingyin got everyone coffee.

36
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,100
Welcome, Miss Gao.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,300
It's nice to see you here.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,660
I bought some coffee and snacks

40
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,740
for everyone.

41
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,505
Every time Qingche gets busy with work,

42
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:00,820
he ignores everything else.

43
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,140
Please bear with him, everyone.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,980
Let's thank her once again.

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,260
Thank you.

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,180
She's not right.

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,720
Captain Su treats us well all the time.

49
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:09,660
What are you saying?

50
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,300
Miss Gao treats us better.

51
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,940
Are you here to check on Qingche today?

52
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,940
Certainly not.

53
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,100
I trust him completely.

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,140
Where's Captain Su?

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,700
He should be in the training room.

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,100
Yes. With Dr. Song.

57
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,260
I'll look for him. You stay here.

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,460
Qingche.

59
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,549
You got distracted,
but all is fair in war.

60
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,820
You taught me that.

61
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,220
Are you alright, Qingche?

62
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,140
I'm fine.

63
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,340
I don't need your help.

64
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,740
Why is she everywhere?

65
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,349
She's like a lingering presence
that won't leave.

66
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,340
Good luck to Captain Su.

67
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,820
Xingchen.

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,578
Even though it's practice,
you should prioritize safety.

69
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,060
What if something happens?

70
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,156
Qingyin, I'm fine.
Please get down from here.

71
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,700
Qingche is invincible.

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,770
He can take a fall and a hit.
Don't you know?

73
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:27,540
Xingchen.

74
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,580
Thank you for training
with Qingche today.

75
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,100
I was just too worried
about him just now.

76
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,620
Don't take it to heart, alright?

77
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,020
Sure.

78
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,260
But...

79
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,580
What's wrong?

80
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,003
All the recent activities involve
just the two of us.

81
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,340
You might have to get used to it.

82
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,220
How...

83
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,500
It's all for the charity event.

84
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,300
You won't mind, will you?

85
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,820
Of course, not.

86
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,660
Seeing how well you practice,

87
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,540
I can't help but want to spar with you.

88
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,712
Qingyin. Stop messing around.

89
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,500
I learned Taekwondo from Qingche,
you know.

90
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,580
I'd like to find out
if I've forgotten the moves.

91
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,340
Lu Qun.

92
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,180
- Take Qingyin...
- Sure.

93
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,780
It's not for you. Don't assume.

94
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,620
This is going to be interesting.

95
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,780
Qiancheng. She's your aunt.

96
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,060
Exactly. That's the interesting part.

97
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,850
Don't you know Song Xingchen?

98
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,220
Will she fight
if she can't win?

99
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,580
I can't control you,
but someone else may.

100
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,340
Xingchen.

101
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,460
If you fall later,

102
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,700
watch out for your bones.

103
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,460
You'll risk having a bone fracture
at your age.

104
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,780
If you lose, don't cry, okay?

105
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,820
I'm not good at comforting children.

106
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,220
One more thing.

107
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,100
No hitting the face.

108
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,080
Goodluck, Aunt Xingchen.

109
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,780
My leg.

110
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,300
I told you not to cry. How old are you?

111
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,420
Be gentle.

112
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,780
How is she?

113
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,756
It's just a little scratch.
Let's go to the infirmary.

114
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,260
I don't want your fake concern.

115
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,585
You guys take her to the infirmary.

116
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,860
Qingyin, let's go.

117
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,300
Can you carry me there, Qingche?

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,220
What are you waiting for? Go.

119
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,380
Come on, help her up.

120
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,700
This is too much fuss.

121
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,260
I guess we'll stay here.

122
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,420
Let her down.

123
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,460
Let go.

124
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,420
Don't go.

125
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,300
Qingyin.

126
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,060
Can you stop acting like a child?

127
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,265
The doctor will be here soon.

128
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,060
Do you really like her?

129
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,300
Of course, I do. She's my girlfriend.

130
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,180
Are you guys dating already?

131
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,500
Yes, we are.

132
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,140
So please don't mention our

133
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,261
arranged marriage anymore.

134
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,060
Aren't we in one?

135
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,180
Of course, not.

136
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,940
I don't care.

137
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,580
She's a vixen.

138
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,340
You've been bewitched by her.

139
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,660
Qingyin.

140
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,352
All along,
I've treated you as my little sister.

141
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,687
It's me who initiated the relationship.

142
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,340
So I know her very well.

143
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,254
After all these years,

144
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,920
this is my first time in a relationship.

145
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,100
I hope you don't make it difficult
for me.

146
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,180
If possible, get along well with her.

147
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,900
You'll find that she's a nice person.

148
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,340
Why did you provoke her?

149
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,820
She's not an easy person to deal with.

150
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,020
Which side are you on?

151
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,380
I'm definitely on your side.

152
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,299
But I'm doing this for your own good.

153
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,820
Qingyin.

154
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,100
Don't you know how Qingche is?

155
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,180
Once he sets his mind on someone,

156
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,780
he won't change.

157
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,700
Besides, I've known Ms. Song

158
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,980
for some time now.

159
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,860
She's indeed a nice person.

160
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,940
So I'd like to advise you

161
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,940
to find someone who suits you.

162
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,460
Don't cling to him

163
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,180
because it won't end well.

164
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,700
That's all from me.
You should take a break.

165
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
I'll look for the team doctor.

166
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,700
Aunt Xingchen.

167
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,220
I have something to tell you.

168
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,020
I just heard Su Qingche
telling Gao Qingyin

169
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,900
that he only sees her
as a little sister,

170
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,759
and it was him
who initiated the relationship.

171
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,400
He told her
not to mess with you anymore.

172
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,540
Did he really say that?

173
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,500
To be honest, I always thought

174
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,660
Su Qingche was acting like he's single,

175
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,180
especially after meeting Gao Qingyin.

176
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,460
But now, it seems
that it was true all along.

177
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,900
He and Tang are evenly matched now.

178
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,740
A draw.

179
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,100
What are you thinking about all day?

180
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,065
I've already said

181
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,219
that there's no possibility
between me and Tang Ruize.

182
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,060
Alright.

183
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
Seeing how biased you are toward him,

184
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,898
I'll add 20 points to him.

185
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,900
- How about 70-30?
- Mind your own business.

186
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,340
How's Gao Qingyin's injury?

187
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,300
I don't know.

188
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,810
The team doctor hasn't come yet.

189
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:21,200
Then why are you standing here?

190
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,909
If it weren't for your shout just now,

191
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,130
she wouldn't have been injured.

192
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,250
If it weren't for your push,

193
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,370
she wouldn't have fallen.

194
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,660
Well, I did it for you.

195
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,420
Then why don't you
go check on her for me?

196
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,810
And comfort her while you're at it.

197
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,820
Gao Qingyin has a sharp tongue.

198
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,380
I'm a bit scared of her.

199
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,261
Will you go or not?

200
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,940
Fine. She's your sister-in-law,
after all.

201
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,500
For your happiness in later years,

202
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,420
I'll bear this burden.

203
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,980
What sister-in-law?

204
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,505
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

205
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,447
Are you in such a hurry
to see her as a relative?

206
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:50,180
Alright. I get it.

207
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,460
Go quickly.

208
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,260
(Infirmary)

209
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,276
(Infirmary)
Be gentle.

210
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,180
Ouch.

211
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,660
Um...

212
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,460
Is she okay?

213
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,620
If you had come a bit later,

214
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,538
the wound would have healed already.

215
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,580
Gently.

216
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,340
Come on. No fractures.

217
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,260
Su Qingche isn't here. Stop wailing.

218
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,540
Is it really fine?

219
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,180
This is just a scratch.

220
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,527
Keep an eye on her.
I have something to do.

221
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,020
Tell me if you need anything.

222
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,660
Sorry.

223
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,112
You got hurt because of me.

224
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,700
Have some water.

225
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,140
I don't want your fake sympathy.

226
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,540
You and your aunt are just the same.

227
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,860
Aggressive and ruthless.

228
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,460
You wanted to compete with her.

229
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,340
But you won't admit your defeat.

230
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,180
I won't admit defeat.

231
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
I have my ways.

232
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,580
Fine.

233
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,060
Then let me tell you.

234
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,340
As long as it's someone
Song Xingchen likes,

235
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,756
she won't easily give up either.

236
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,140
Your rank isn't even enough.

237
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,340
I'm leaving. Good luck.

238
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,860
Are you going to leave me here alone?

239
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,220
Otherwise?

240
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,476
Do you want me to carry you?

241
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,340
That works too. Wait a moment.

242
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,260
Carry you like this?

243
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,980
Qiancheng! Get out!

244
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,160
Okay, if you said so.
Call me if you need anything.

245
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,060
Xingchen.

246
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,180
You're here.

247
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,065
I've been waiting for you.

248
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,700
I did teach Gao Qingyin Taekwondo,

249
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,260
but

250
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,254
it was when we were...

251
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,730
Alright, you don't need to explain.

252
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,460
I already know what you said

253
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
to Gao Qingyin just now.

254
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,940
Qiancheng wanted to check on Gao Qingyin

255
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,660
but accidentally overheard.

256
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,420
I'm sorry to make you annoyed.

257
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,620
As long as you're firm
in your position and attitude,

258
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,380
other things don't matter.

259
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,660
You sweated, right?

260
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,960
I'll get you some clothes.

261
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,660
I want to wear yours.

262
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,300
My clothes are only
for my girlfriend to wear.

263
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,701
When it comes to opposite-sex clothing,

264
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,940
I only wear my boyfriend's.

265
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,940
Song Xingchen.

266
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,460
It seems you lost our game.

267
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,500
You lost too.

268
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,940
Since you lost, I want a reward.

269
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,140
What reward?

270
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,660
We just launched LYS products.

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,700
I want you to help me boost sales.

272
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,580
Why does it sound like an online scam?

273
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,900
- Boost or not?
- Boost.

274
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,410
Remember to leave a good review.

275
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,060
Sure thing.

276
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,540
You lost too. What's my reward?

277
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,100
Captain Su, we...

278
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,500
We have a meeting later.

279
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,020
I'll go prepare first.

280
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,660
Let's go.

281
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,130
Change your clothes.

282
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,340
Hurry up.

283
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,140
Why didn't you say you were coming?

284
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,260
I've already completed your reward.

285
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,860
I saw it in the backend.

286
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,820
Not bad. Exceeded my request.

287
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,020
What about my reward?

288
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,460
Alright, what reward do you want?

289
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,060
I've bought the ingredients.

290
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,843
I want you to cook me a meal.

291
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,060
Are you sure?

292
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,247
Have you thought about it?

293
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,460
It takes courage to eat my cooking.

294
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,460
I have the courage.

295
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,185
I've even prepared stomach medicine.

296
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,340
Alright.

297
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,140
Also,

298
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,669
it's my first time officially
coming to my girlfriend's house,

299
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,927
so I have to prepare a surprise.

300
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,690
Do you like it?

301
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,260
Impressive.

302
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,900
Alright, I'll show off

303
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,020
my cooking skills today.

304
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:33,980
Let's go.

305
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,469
Be careful with your fingers.

306
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,540
Can I cut it like this?

307
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,380
It's fine.

308
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,189
You can cut it into any shape you want.

309
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,461
Make sure I look good on screen.

310
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:44,007
Got it.

311
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,280
You look good from any angle.

312
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:46,980
Be careful.

313
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,818
I'm already looking forward to it.

314
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,620
It's heavy.

315
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,720
I'll serve the rice.

316
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,100
The water for the rice

317
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,220
seems a bit too much.

318
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,140
As long as the water covers the rice,

319
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,620
a joint of one finger is enough.

320
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,380
Alright.

321
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,060
And this tomato scrambled eggs.

322
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,020
The tomatoes seem a bit overcooked.

323
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,220
The meat...

324
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,820
It seems a bit overcooked too.

325
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,978
Have you not taken enough
self-defense classes?

326
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,860
Coach Su.

327
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,180
I've taken enough.

328
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,460
Do you still want to eat?

329
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,540
Yes, of course.

330
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,740
It's delicious.

331
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,540
Really?

332
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,700
Really. Try it.

333
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,580
Try it.

334
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,500
How is it?

335
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,580
Not tasty?

336
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,810
Is your sense of taste malfunctioning,
Su Qingche?

337
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:06,740
Don't eat it.

338
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,300
Don't.

339
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,540
I want to eat.

340
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,185
Don't move.

341
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,620
Don't eat it. You'll get diarrhea.

342
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,620
I won't.

343
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,260
Really?

344
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,740
It's really delicious.

345
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,220
How did you do it?

346
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,940
As long as it's made by you, I love it.

347
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,734
What are you looking at?

348
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,969
I want to drink beer and eat duck neck.

349
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,167
Go get them for me downstairs.

350
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,210
It's so late,
and you still want to eat and drink?

351
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,287
Do you have no conscience?

352
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,538
I didn't eat anything just now.

353
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Okay. I'll go now.

354
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,643
I'm going to take a shower.

355
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,660
When did you come back?

356
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,660
I just got back.

357
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,232
I also bought fried chicken.

358
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,705
I'll stay with you
until we finish eating.

359
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,740
Okay.

360
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,980
(Viewing history)

361
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,100
(Viewing history)
"Virgin Boss Wants To Marry Me".

362
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,420
"My Rescue Team Boyfriend".

363
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,420
I didn't read those. It's Xiaoli.

364
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,060
Did Han Xiaoli come by a few days ago?

365
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,140
Alright, she didn't.

366
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,060
I read those. Is that not allowed?

367
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,589
It's allowed, but it's not necessary.

368
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,540
What do you mean?

369
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,580
Your boyfriend, me,

370
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,163
is the captain of a rescue team, right?

371
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,940
So what?

372
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,980
Now I'm right by your side.

373
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
So what?

374
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,580
So we've almost finished eating.

375
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,460
Isn't it time to sleep?

376
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,523
It's not even 10:00 p.m. yet.
It's early.

377
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,020
Then what do you want to do?

378
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,980
Well, I bought something.

379
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,020
Can you help me try it out?

380
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
Are you ready?

381
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,580
Yes.

382
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
Su Qingche.

383
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,180
How could you

384
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,260
really attack me?

385
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,389
I didn't do it on purpose.

386
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,660
You did it on purpose.

387
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,220
Let's start again.

388
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,900
Bring it on.

389
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,020
Su Qingche!

390
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,820
One hit is not enough,

391
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,740
so you hit me twice?

392
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,540
How could you?

393
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,020
I didn't do it on purpose.

394
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,580
Lies. I'm quitting.

395
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,740
Don't quit.

396
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,460
It's fun.

397
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,694
Let's play a different one.

398
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,660
Which one?

399
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,380
Log Wobble.

400
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,320
(Haicheng City Go Tournament.
Title: "Emerging Go Player".)

401
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,120
(Salt)

402
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,720
(Sugar)

403
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,261
Nice pajamas.
I got changed the moment I arrived.

404
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,500
What is it? Still angry?

405
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,330
Since you come early to apologize,

406
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,300
I'll let you off for now.

407
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,820
But when you leave later,

408
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,100
take the game console with you
and throw it away.

409
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,500
Throw it away?

410
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,980
What?

411
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,940
It was a lousy game.

412
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,820
What's wrong? Here. Sit.

413
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,580
I think
I get a stiff neck in my sleep.

414
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,940
How come?

415
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,700
Let me have a look.

416
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,220
Is it here?

417
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,700
Better now?

418
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,620
Yeah.

419
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,220
- Massage a bit harder.
- Okay.

420
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,580
It can get even better.

421
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,940
Really?

422
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,900
Tilt your head a bit to the right.

423
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,540
By the way,

424
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,980
which fruit do you prefer

425
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,420
for breakfast?

426
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,820
Su Qingche.

427
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,425
Are you trying to break my neck?

428
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:45,940
Easy.

429
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,620
The process may be unpleasant.

430
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,260
But try moving your neck a bit now.

431
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,843
It's better now, right?

432
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,980
Yeah, it does.

433
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,780
But you still shouldn't surprise me.

434
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,981
As long as you're better now.

435
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,660
Let's have breakfast now.

436
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,250
I made it for you specially.

437
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,549
My neck seems to be better now.

438
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,340
I like to play some nice music

439
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,100
when I have breakfast. Is that okay?

440
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,260
Sure, go ahead.

441
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,700
Su Qingche.

442
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,100
Is that me...

443
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:25,980
Is it good?

444
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,580
Leave me with some dignity, Su Qingche.

445
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,900
You're mean.

446
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
Grandpa.

447
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,220
Kid, you're here.

448
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,780
No need to buy things for me.

449
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,420
What's wrong with your leg?

450
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,660
Someone bullied me.

451
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,020
Who is it? They're audacious.

452
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,294
Tell me about it.

453
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,700
I'll teach them a lesson.

454
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,620
A woman. A particularly annoying woman.

455
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,260
A woman?

456
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,140
Sit down.

457
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,620
Sit down and tell me

458
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,820
what happened exactly.

459
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,420
How could this woman be so audacious?

460
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,980
Tell me. What happened?

461
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,060
I just came back from Qingche's place.

462
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,500
It happened right in front of him?

463
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,060
Why didn't he do anything?

464
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,380
Who is this woman?

465
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,660
It's the one from the blind date.

466
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,740
The blind date? Who is it?

467
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,620
The one who owns the lingerie shop.

468
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,740
She used to be a doctor.

469
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,860
Right, I remember.

470
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,140
But they're over now.

471
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,700
It didn't work out. They ended it.

472
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,460
It's Song Xingchen.

473
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Grandpa, look. She did this.

474
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,060
Your injury looks serious.

475
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,380
I don't understand though.

476
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,860
You two don't know each other

477
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,260
and are hardly connected.

478
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,860
So how did you get into a fight?

479
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,940
Due to a public welfare event,

480
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,100
she's always pestering Qingche,

481
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,140
and she's jealous
of how well he treats me.

482
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,060
She's in the rescue team too?

483
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,980
This is tricky.

484
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,380
I think she's using the event

485
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,500
as an excuse to get close to Qingche.

486
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,300
Maybe it's because of her job,

487
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,540
she's very open-minded.

488
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,300
She keeps looking for Qingche,

489
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,740
ignoring the fact
that they are a man and woman alone.

490
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,740
Interesting.

491
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,220
How is it now?

492
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,900
Is that woman pursuing Qingche?

493
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,340
Grandpa, you can't be this desperate.

494
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,420
Song Xingchen
made me sick the other day.

495
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,660
Even though I'm a dedicated model,

496
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,060
I can't handle the cold.

497
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,260
There were like seven
or eight fans blowing right at me.

498
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,340
Seven or eight fans?

499
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,860
That's too much.

500
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,860
This woman
has a problem with her character.

501
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,620
She's disloyal.

502
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,712
While still involved
with her ex-boyfriend,

503
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,460
she's getting close to Qingche.

504
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,220
She's entangled with her ex-boyfriend?

505
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,740
No, this won't do.

506
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,540
This is a matter of morality.

507
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,403
This is bad.

508
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,500
She's a vixen.

509
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,100
Grandpa.

510
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,380
You must hold your bottom line.

511
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,900
You can't let a woman
like her into your family.

512
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,740
If what you say is true,

513
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,140
I'd rather have Qingche
stay single forever

514
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,660
than have this kind
of woman into our Su family.

515
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,020
Grandpa.

516
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,380
You have to step up at a time like this.

517
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,340
Qingche listens to you the most.

518
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,340
Don't worry.

519
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,460
I'll definitely step up
when the time comes.

520
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,580
Grandpa, I'm back.

521
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,260
Why did you come?

522
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,760
Your knee is better?

523
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,140
I'm fine now.

524
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,500
I just got some groceries
from the market.

525
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,900
I'll help if you cook.

526
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,460
I bought these at the market by myself.

527
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,740
They are fresh.

528
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,100
(Online shopping)

529
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,180
The joy of online grocery shopping?

530
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,060
Someone must have put that in.

531
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,900
Qingyin.

532
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,647
Avoid coming
to the Rescue Centre in the future.

533
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,660
Why?

534
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,556
You're not a member of the rescue team.

535
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,090
It's not good for you to be there.

536
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,501
You'll bother our training.

537
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,500
Is it because of Song Xingchen?

538
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,580
I don't want to repeat this again.

539
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,380
Didn't I make it clear to you?

540
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,100
I don't want anyone

541
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,550
to misunderstand our relationship.

542
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,660
I didn't clarify it
in front of the others

543
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,740
and Grandpa

544
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,581
because I want to leave you
with some dignity.

545
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,940
Qingche.

546
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,260
I'm telling you.

547
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,940
A home only feels like a home

548
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,740
when there's a woman.

549
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,260
Look. Just now,

550
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,090
she was washing vegetables,
and you were cutting them.

551
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
That scene was heartwarming,

552
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,100
very heartwarming.

553
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,180
Grandpa, enough.

554
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,220
Please stop with the matchmaking, okay?

555
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,980
Who's the one dating? Me or you?

556
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,260
You.

557
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,100
That's it.

558
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,820
You have to start dating though.

559
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,500
You haven't
given me a definite answer until now.

560
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,814
Of course,
I'll arrange blind dates for you.

561
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,660
I beg you. Please stop arranging them.

562
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,660
I have someone I like.

563
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,740
Really?

564
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,660
If you have someone you like,

565
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,660
bring her back for me to see.

566
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,380
This thing

567
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,180
must be put on the agenda.

568
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,020
What's the deal
with your former blind date?

569
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,380
Did Qingyin tell you something?

570
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,740
What can she tell me?

571
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,260
You two grew up together.

572
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,340
She always takes your side.

573
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,380
You're lying.

574
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,380
So what did she tell you?

575
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,020
Why do you care?

576
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,930
Is it true you're dating the woman?

577
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:34,700
Yes, we're dating.

578
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,900
You should bring her back for us to see.

579
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:38,940
I'm planning

580
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,020
to wait
until our relationship gets more stable.

581
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:43,530
Besides,
aren't you the one who finds her?

582
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,620
The matchmaker
only told me a little about her.

583
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,780
I haven't even met her.

584
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,820
Good.

585
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,054
Stop worrying about it. Okay?

586
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Who else will worry about you then?

587
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,901
To be honest,

588
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:57,280
my choice of a granddaughter-in-law
is very straightforward.

589
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,580
Her profession, appearance,

590
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,140
and even family background.

591
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,060
Those aren't important.

592
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,230
The key is that she must
have a good character.

593
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:03,780
Yes, I know.

594
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,600
You can't have one foot in each boat,

595
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,974
juggling between two relationships.

596
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,436
That's bad, a matter of principles.

597
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,740
Also,

598
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,140
she must be mature.

599
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,420
No matter what she does,

600
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,320
even if it's running an online store,

601
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,180
she must
do things steadily and reliably,

602
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,981
not giving others a chance
to find fault.

603
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,900
Okay, I understand, Grandpa.

604
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,214
Rest assured.
I know what to do and my limits, okay?

605
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,580
Your limits?

606
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
You say it like you
have many experiences

607
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,619
and have been in several relationships.

608
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,900
You better follow my standards
to find your partner.

609
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,340
Your limits?

610
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,700
Happy Kitten?

611
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,260
Grandpa, try this fish belly.
It's very tender.

612
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,140
You have some, too.

613
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,780
Grandpa, I'm done eating.

614
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:55,810
I still have materials to read,
I'll leave first.

615
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:56,470
I'll come with.

616
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:57,020
No.

617
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,820
You accompany Grandpa and chat with him.

618
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,580
Go home soon.

619
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,060
Grandpa, I'll clean up later.

620
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,060
Kid.

621
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,460
Don't be so anxious.

622
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,860
Regarding

623
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,780
Qingche and Song Xingchen,

624
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,420
I will consider it carefully.

625
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,820
Grandpa.

626
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,220
don't you think

627
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,620
Qingche should find someone
who knows everything about him?

628
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,620
Yes.

629
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,980
I understand what you mean.

630
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,940
But you must remember this advice.

631
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,420
All things have their fate.

632
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,100
A melon forced to grow is not sweet.

633
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Grandpa.

634
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,700
If I don't force it,
someone else will eat it.

635
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,220
Then remember this.

636
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,260
Ignore the words of the elders
at your peril.

637
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,940
Alright. Eat.

638
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,500
Here, have some more meat.

639
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,380
Stop thinking about this matter.

640
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,700
That's right.

641
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,100
(Stardust Rouge)

642
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,700
The response
to Gao Qingyin's photos is really good.

643
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,500
Our popularity has increased a lot.

644
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,300
This proves that our vertical approach
is quite effective.

645
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,940
The new approach
we designed suits LYS very well.

646
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,820
Let me check Weibo.

647
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,940
Everyone's praising our website
for its high-end design

648
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
and that it's different from the norm.

649
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
But some are also praising Gao Qingyin.

650
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,020
Why do we

651
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,910
(Mentions: 502, Comments: 23, Likes: 12)
have so many messages on our Weibo?

652
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,300
Let me see.

653
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,580
Look.

654
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,500
(Netizens: That's so sweet.)

655
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,260
(They're hugging.)

656
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,140
(Netizens:
This is like a real-life TV drama.)

657
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,060
(When will this happen to me?)

658
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,140
(Dear boss, how much should I
buy to get a handsome guy?)

659
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,100
(Both man and woman look stunning.)

660
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,340
(Simply outstanding.)

661
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,420
(I want to visit the store.)

662
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,340
You guys look so great together.

663
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,392
When the video went viral,

664
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,580
many people traced it back to us.

665
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,620
This is great.

666
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,140
Not only did it
create buzz for Polar Night,

667
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,780
but it also brought us a lot of traffic.

668
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,140
Looks like we
need to commend Qiancheng for this.

669
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,700
But I've noticed

670
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,580
someone's boyfriend secretly
purchased our products.

671
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,260
If I didn't know, I'd think he
bought them for someone else.

672
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,020
Here I am, thinking about promotions,

673
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,660
and you're teasing me.

674
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,540
I wouldn't dare.

675
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,100
But I've already shipped the goods.

676
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,700
The address is Captain Su's house.

677
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,519
By the way, I have some sorting to do.

678
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,512
I'll be at the warehouse.

679
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,269
Go ahead.

680
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,820
Why are you here?

681
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,700
To celebrate

682
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,900
the store's increased sales.

683
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,727
I also brought your favorite drink.

684
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,660
What's up?

685
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,460
I have a training session in Sucheng,

686
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,900
and hope you can accompany me.

687
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,500
No problem.

688
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,660
I was just
thinking of going sightseeing.

689
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,301
But most importantly, to be with you.

690
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,980
But I don't know if you're ready.

691
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,500
Ready for what?

692
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,380
I need to evaluate my teachings.

693
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,260
Right here?

694
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,300
You're in danger now.

695
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,420
A villain tightly

696
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,020
hugged you from behind.

697
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,140
What should you do?

698
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,220
Hold the villain's arm firmly

699
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,020
and strike backward at his crotch,

700
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,260
which will temporarily immobilize him.

701
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,780
Not bad.

702
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,940
Now,

703
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,820
the villain hugs you tightly

704
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,060
from the front,

705
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,220
and you can't break free.

706
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,820
What should you do?

707
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,260
Form your hands like a bowl

708
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,980
and press them on his ears,

709
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,690
causing pain to his ears
and gaining an opportunity to escape.

710
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,260
He's hugging even tighter now.

711
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,180
Don't your ears hurt?
Why aren't you letting go?

712
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,140
No, they don't.

713
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,596
You're so good-looking
that I can't feel pain.

714
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
You're here.

715
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,140
You guys continue.

716
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,060
Pretend I'm not here.

717
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,552
Where are you going?

718
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,180
You want me to send all these out today?

719
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,060
Don't we have free labor?

720
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,220
Thank you.

721
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,380
Thank you.

722
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,860
Captain Su.

723
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,220
If you come here more often,

724
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,141
we wouldn't need
to hire someone to pack things.

725
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,556
You never needed one
in the first place. I am the packer.

726
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,660
Who is it?

727
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,780
Coming.

728
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,180
I'm coming.

729
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,460
Wang.

730
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,260
Old Mr. Su, this
is your grandson's delivery.

731
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,352
I saw it when I finished work
and brought it over.

732
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,820
Who's the sender?

733
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,260
Happy

734
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,700
Kitten.

735
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,580
Okay.

736
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,380
Why are you staring? Go home.

737
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,620
Happy Kitten?

738
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,140
Sounds like it's from a girl.

739
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,300
I'll open it and take a look.

740
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,100
It's a package, not a letter,

741
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,500
right?

742
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,420
I need to check it.

743
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,700
So many things?

744
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,220
What is this stuff?

745
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,260
Smells pretty good.

746
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,500
Facial cleansing oil?

747
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,940
What's this?

748
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,100
Shaving cream?

749
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,060
What?

750
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,420
What is this thing?

751
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,700
Silky smooth.

752
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,100
(Rose soothe)

753
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,500
Unlocks the secret of a woman's body.

754
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,820
Wait. What is all this?

755
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,580
The two of you showing off on screen

756
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,840
have caused an uproar
in the comment section.

757
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,500
It works really well.

758
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,200
You even promoted Xingchen's store

759
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:24,385
and brought them some traffic.

760
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,949
Are you guys going to Sucheng together

761
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:28,900
for the upcoming task?

762
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,060
Good work, bro.

763
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,469
What are you thinking?

764
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,120
We're not staying together.

765
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,700
As for you,

766
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,700
you better oversee everything here

767
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,660
and don't make mistakes.

768
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,580
It will be fine.

769
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,061
I know what to do, so don't worry.

770
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,100
Are you sure?

771
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,020
Personnel arrangements
and who will be going?

772
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,540
Tell me.

773
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,380
It's definitely going...

774
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,500
(Grandpa)

775
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,460
Your phone.

776
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,780
Hey, Grandpa. What's up?

777
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,020
(Su Qingche.)

778
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,620
Come back home immediately.

779
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,220
I...

780
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,940
(Immediately.)

781
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,220
What's going on?

782
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,500
Look at this. What is this thing?

783
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,380
Vulgar and indecent.
Chaotic private life.

784
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,540
What a disgrace.

785
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,140
Report.

786
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,349
My private life is extremely healthy.

787
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,381
It couldn't be healthier.

788
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,700
You call this healthy?

789
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,540
I think you're a pervert.

790
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,487
With such moral character, who would
dare match you up with any girl?

791
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,600
Didn't I tell you last time?

792
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,100
The last one was pretty good,

793
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,900
so no more.

794
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,100
Wait a minute.

795
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,100
Is it that one with an indecent job?

796
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,980
Did she send all these things to you?

797
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,260
But she's
not doing anything indecent now.

798
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,980
She now runs a women's supply store.

799
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,500
Come on. It's still the same.

800
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,780
But why is she

801
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,220
sending you all these obscene things?

802
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,203
I feel embarrassed just looking at them.

803
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:07,820
Grandpa. These aren't obscene things.

804
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,820
These are things

805
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,640
that women often use.

806
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:12,020
You don't know these products,

807
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,660
so you shouldn't judge them.

808
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,860
I believe you're a reasonable person.

809
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,260
Regardless of that,

810
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,700
How could a woman send these things

811
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,980
to a man for no reason?

812
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,100
I can't accept that, either.

813
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,940
This is her business.
It's legal and reasonable.

814
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,100
You can't judge her character

815
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,940
based on what products she sells.

816
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,380
Once you meet her and get to know her,

817
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,580
I believe you will be satisfied.

818
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,620
But these...

819
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,700
these are all women's things.

820
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,180
Can you use them?

821
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,100
I don't know.

822
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,420
I bought them to support her business.

823
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,620
You bought them?

824
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,980
To support her business?

825
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,500
Yeah.

826
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,500
Not bad, kid.

827
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,420
You've improved.

828
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,260
You know how to win a woman's favor now.

829
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,276
Fine. You've already bought it anyway.

830
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,500
But take them away.

831
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,820
They're an eyesore.

832
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,060
Grandpa, why don't I
apply some on your hands?

833
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,425
- Go away.
- It's moisturizing.

834
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,060
Take them away. Quick.

835
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,580
Hurry up.

836
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,549
Are you not going to try it?

837
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,140
(Stardust Rouge)

838
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,620
