=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,680
=Episode 22=

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:47,970
Here.

25
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,370
Have some fruit.

26
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,210
Ma'am, are you still angry?

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,810
Back when choosing a partner,

28
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,300
wasn't it you and Madam Liu
who selected him?

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,170
How can it be the same?

30
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,070
Why is it not the same?

31
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,390
Of course, it's not.

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,130
Now the nature is different.

33
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,690
You see. The two of them

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,010
conspired together

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,490
and kept it from us.

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,210
He even pretended to be a cleaner.

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you think, with his behavior,

38
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,810
he can take care of your daughter?

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,410
In my opinion,

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,210
you don't know

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,690
this young man yet.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,530
Get to know him first
before saying anything, okay?

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,010
Don't let me see him.

44
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,930
I won't spare him.

45
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,170
It won't end well for him.

46
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,530
It must be Xingchen who's back.

47
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,450
Come.

48
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,130
Let's go.

49
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,250
Dad, Mom.

50
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,050
Xingchen, you're back.

51
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,730
Why are you back at this time?

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,890
I missed home.

53
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,810
I missed my dear mom and dad.

54
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,410
Now you know to come back?

55
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,450
You still remember you have parents?

56
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,010
Of course.

57
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,420
My daughter is such a good girl.

58
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,010
How long will you stay this time?

59
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,170
Until my mom cools down.

60
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,730
Song Jianguo.

61
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,850
It's your precious daughter.

62
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,930
You take care of her.

63
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,850
You know your mom's temper.

64
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,410
Don't take it to heart.

65
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,410
Okay? I'll make you some delicious food.

66
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,410
I already ate.

67
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,530
You already ate?

68
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,450
Alright, I'll help you unpack...

69
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:27,970
No need, Dad.

70
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,810
I can unpack myself.

71
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,810
I'm going inside.

72
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,650
Mom.

73
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,570
I can do it myself.

74
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,450
Mom.

75
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,450
Why can't I see you?

76
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,370
Why are you blocking the camera?

77
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,450
Let me see you.

78
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,050
(Are you not at home?)

79
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,690
Did you go to a nightclub?

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,260
If I'm going to a nightclub,
I'll put on some villainous makeup.

81
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,930
Why won't you let me see you?

82
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,050
Are you hiding a man at home?

83
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,450
(Stop guessing. It's not funny.)

84
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,290
This is your home?

85
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,410
Let me show you around.

86
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,130
Wait.

87
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,490
You have so many dolls in your room.

88
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,690
What's that pig?

89
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,760
Continue laughing.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,180
Laugh again, and I'll hang up.

91
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,410
Don't.

92
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,370
But...

93
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,010
The contrast
between these things and you

94
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,300
is indeed quite significant.

95
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,950
How long has it been
since you came home?

96
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,530
You're using things from your childhood.

97
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,690
(Indeed, I haven't stayed at home
or a long time.)

98
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,610
(Every time I come home for dinner,)

99
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,650
(I just leave directly.)

100
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,090
(But my mom)

101
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,650
(still tidies this room up
every two or three days.)

102
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,890
This time, you should stay at home
for a few more days.

103
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,140
Accompany your parents well.

104
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,090
I'll pick you up for work.

105
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,240
So you don't have to drive.

106
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,210
(You don't know.)

107
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,810
(From childhood to now,)

108
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,290
(my mom worries
about everything for me.)

109
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,970
I can see that.

110
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,650
In your mom's eyes,

111
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,290
you're still a little princess.

112
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,370
(I realized)

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,120
(that it's been a long time)

114
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,610
(since I had a good chat with my mom.)

115
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:25,930
(Work,)

116
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,170
(resignation,)

117
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,290
(and even dating you,)

118
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,450
(I made decisions on my own.)

119
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,250
(I never asked her.)

120
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,890
(Come to think of it now, my mom)

121
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,530
(may not have opinions about you.)

122
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,170
(She must have opinions about me.)

123
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,810
This time, talk to your mom.

124
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,250
The past is past,

125
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,570
but we

126
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,170
can't repeat the same mistakes.

127
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,370
(I've decided.)

128
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,410
(It's time for my mom to know)

129
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,840
(I'm no longer that little princess.)

130
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:52,810
Right.

131
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,010
I support you.

132
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,090
(What are you doing?)

133
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,010
I'm thinking about you.

134
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,410
(Alright, I'll hang up first.)

135
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,450
(Hello.)

137
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,570
(Hi.)

(Welcome to Stardust Rogue.)

139
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,130
(How can I help you?)

140
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,830
(Stumbling Deer: There are
too many products in your store.)

141
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,900
(I'd like to inquire.)

142
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,390
(Stardust Rogue: Go on.)

143

(I want to give a gift
to a girl I like.)

are suitable?)

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,360
(Stardust Rogue: Are you really
asking me what's suitable?)

146
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,290
(You should ask what's not suitable.)

147
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,870
(Stardust Rogue: Product link)

148
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,610
(These are all suitable.)

149
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,690
(All ordered.
Please arrange delivery for me.)

150
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,810
So generous.

152
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,090
I think

153
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,370
this address is near Polar Night.

154
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,290
(I'll process your order right away.)

155
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,810
(One more question.)

156
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,370
(I want to pursue this girl.)

157
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,170
(What else can I send her?)

158
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,090
(For example,
any good food recommendations?)

159
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,970
(There's a popular
cream puff shop recently.)

160
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,170
(Many girls love it.)

161
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,650
(But it's always crowded.)

162
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,480
(I went twice and didn't get anything.)

163
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,010
(I even complained on my Moments.)

164
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,690

167
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,010
First, you need to have manners.

168
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,050
Respect everyone
you come into contact with.

169
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,130
Isn't that obvious?

Well done.

But for such matters,

175
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,080
you don't need to look it up online.

176
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,170
Just ask me.

177
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,770
It's very simple.

178
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,770
In summary, three words.

179
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,890
Image,

strength,

and attitude.

182
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,930
What is an image?

183
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:02,890
It means

184
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,010
handsome and gives a sense of security.

185
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,770
You're okay.

186
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,130
Strength, then.

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,570
It means not lacking money.

188
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,770
Able to provide

189
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,540
a very good material life
for their daughter.

190
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,370
After all,

191
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,130
the material foundation
determines the superstructure.

192
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,770
Most importantly,

193
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,370
it's attitude.

194
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,410
You have to show

195
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,090
that you're very good to their daughter,

196
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,050
and you must respect and care for them.

197
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,090
Tell me.

198
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,130
If you can achieve these three points,

199
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,330
you can win over any parents
in the world.

200
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,130
Dad.

201
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,850
Are you going out?

202
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,130
Mom specially made what you like to eat.

203
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,900
Eat or not, it's up to you.

204
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,010
I'm not going out.

205
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,050
But there's an appointment at home.

206
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,170
Song Xingchen.

207
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,650
What are you trying to do?

208
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,410
He's here. I'll go pick him up.

209
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,250
This child.

210
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,810
Who's coming?

211
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,090
This cheeky girl.

212
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,840
Someone is coming to our house,

213
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,410
but she didn't even tell us.

214
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,050
We're not prepared at all.

215
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,490
Hurry, go check

216
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,980
if there's any food in the fridge.

217
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,610
Alright, I'll take a look.

218
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:23,930
Here?

219
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,610
So?

220
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,010
Are you ready?

221
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,730
Is my outfit not formal enough?

222
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,600
It's perfect.

223
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,250
From top to bottom, it's giving

224
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,330
"Song Xingchen's man" vibe.

225
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,730
Let's go.

226
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:47,730
Mrs. Song.

227
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,690
This is a gift I prepared for you.

228
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,010
And this is...

229
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,610
This is for...

230
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,090
Dad.

231
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,970
This is your favorite liquor

232
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,290
and your favorite handicrafts.

233
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,690
Thank you.

234
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:01,610
What now?

235
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,130
Trying to win favor?

236
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,210
Mom.

237
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,690
He's just here for a meal.

238
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,770
Why are you saying that?

239
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,170
Xingchen.

240
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,730
You're wrong on this.

241
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,810
If Su is coming,

242
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,930
you should have given us a heads-up.

243
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,130
It made us so passive.

244
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,090
It's okay, Mr. Song.

245
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:23,810
Okay.

246
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,220
I'll add a few more dishes.

247
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,420
No need, Mr. Song. You don't...

248
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,100
Song Jianguo.

249
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:28,850
Here.

250
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,810
Heat up the tonic soup
I stewed in the morning

251
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,370
and add more ingredients.

252
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,970
Understood.

253
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,050
Mrs. Song.

254
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,250
I can also cook a few dishes.

255
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,130
Shall I help Mr. Song?

256
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:43,730
Sure.

257
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,730
Mr. Song.

258
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,050
Let me help you.

259
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,490
Mr. Song.

260
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,250
Let me do it for you.

261
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,330
I didn't know you can cook.

262
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,010
My parents passed away when I was young.

263
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,650
I had to do everything on my own.

264
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,170
Grandpa used to tell me

265
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,850
kids like me mature early.

266
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,090
Nice.

267
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:13,650
Okay.

268
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,830
Mr. Song,
should I peel the cucumber?

269
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,600
Start with these.

270
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,050
Okay, I will.

271
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,690
Ever since you discharged,

272
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,530
you act like a different person.

273
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,690
I don't understand

274
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,250
any of your decisions.

275
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,530
I'm done.

276
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:35,930
Mom.

277
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,690
My business

278
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,690
and the man I like

279
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,090
are all my choices.

280
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,090
Growing up,

281
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,530
I never had the freedom

282
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,490
to make my decisions.

283
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,090
Even now,

284
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,130
my room is still of a princess style.

285
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,370
Mom, do you know

286
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,970
what I like

287
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,970
or what I wish to do?

288
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,940
For the longest time,

289
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,730
I've respected your choice

290
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,290
as long as it's something you like.

291
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,050
At some point, though,

292
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,050
you stopped confiding in me.

293
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,250
Mom.

294
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,210
Just like this garment,

295
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,450
you'll never know

296
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,010
what I'm up to

297
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,290
if you don't try it on.

298
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,730
As for Su Qingche,

299
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,490
you'll never know

300
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,650
whether he's good for me

301
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,370
if you don't spend time with him.

302
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,050
So, you do know to consider my feelings.

303
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,730
Su.

304
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,850
You should know
my daughter is my everything.

305
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,410
I've imagined countless times

306
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,730
how my son-in-law

307
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,850
would look or be like.

308
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,490
But none of that imagining

309
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,170
led me to anticipate

310
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,210
someone like you.

311
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,450
Mr. Song.

312
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,490
What can I do

313
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,690
to make you

314
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,130
and Mrs. Song satisfied?

315
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,090
At the very least,

316
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,810
be better than me.

317
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,210
That's enough, Mrs. Song.

318
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,850
I made it myself,

319
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,330
so you should have more.

320
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,290
Be patient.

321
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,170
Thank you.

322
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,330
Su.

323
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,330
This is our unique tonic soup.

324
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,080
It's specifically for someone like you,

325
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,930
whose physical consumption
is relatively high,

326
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,170
to replenish energy.

327
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:52,850
Sure.

328
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,290
Mom.

329
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,130
We shouldn't simply drink herbal soups.

330
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,530
Do you not like the taste,

331
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,570
or does he not want to drink it?

332
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,610
No, Mrs. Song.

333
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,650
It's okay. I've had herbal soup before.

334
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,720
It's okay. Let me taste it.

335
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,290
Is it good?

336
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,650
Yeah, not bad.

337
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:16,850
Yummy.

338
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,930
Here. A quick fix.

339
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,450
Have another bowl.

340
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:20,850
Mom.

341
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,980
I've had enough, Mrs. Song.

342
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,090
That's enough, Mrs. Song.

343
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:26,810
I'm good.

344
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,890
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

345
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,650
Su.

346
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,170
Youngsters like you

347
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,570
date without the elders' knowledge,

348
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,550
work as a cleaner
at your girlfriend's house,

349
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,010
and have to reject blind dates.

350
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,930
That has to be exhausting, right?

351
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:47,970
Replenish yourself.

352
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,410
Yes, you should.

353
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,450
You guys are right.

354
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,250
I'll drink this bowl too.

355
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,610
It's your turn now.

356
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,090
Quickly.

357
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,410
Got it.

358
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,450
Watch me.

359
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,530
Let me present this.

360
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,530
Mr. Song.

361
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,130
Can you drink alcohol?

362
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,010
I can, but...

363
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,770
That makes it easy.

364
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,530
Let's have a few today. You and me.

365
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,490
Come on.

366
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,250
Mr. Song.

367
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,810
Today

368
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,090
marks our first drink together.

369
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,050
Hence,

370
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,330
it's our first-meet drink.

371
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,090
According to our family's tradition,

372
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,970
I'll take a shot.

373
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,890
You do as you like.

374
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,580
No, Mr. Song, you don't have to.

375
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:53,890
Do

376
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,610
as you like.

377
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,370
Mr. Song.

378
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,810
I'll drink.

379
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,650
Nice.

380
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,050
Great.

381
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,970
Mom, talk Dad out of this.

382
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,290
Normally,

383
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,650
I would do that,

384
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,930
but today is a rare occasion.

385
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,490
I think your dad

386
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,970
deserves to enjoy himself.

387
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,490
Mom, what are you doing?

388
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,890
Didn't you say

389
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,690
I should get to know him better?

390
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,650
How do I do that if he doesn't drink?

391
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,090
Character is revealed through drinking.

392
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,890
Your mom is right about that.

393
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,570
One's character

394
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,450
can be seen

395
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,370
through drinking.

396
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,090
Come on, Su.

397
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,290
You've met my daughter.

398
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,890
What's that called?

399
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,250
Fate.

400
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:48,970
Right?

401
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,370
Right.

402
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,330
Good.

403
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,210
Cheers to fate.

404
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,250
Cheers to fate, Mr. Song.

405
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,770
Cheers.

406
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,170
Mom, aren't you going too far?

407
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,890
How so?

408
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,090
Still remember who complained

409
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,730
about the blind date?

410
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,530
We even got scolded

411
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,770
by the matchmaker.

412
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,050
Then, he entered your home
and pretended to be a cleaner.

413
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,610
He deserves everything

414
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,610
coming his way now.

415
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,930
It's a misunderstanding.

416
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,410
You'll pay the price

417
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,210
for acting without permission.

418
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,890
I can tell you really like him.

419
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,610
But as your mom,

420
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,290
he needs to show

421
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,890
how much he likes you.

422
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,210
By the way,

423
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,970
we're out of hangover medicine.

424
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,170
Go out and buy some

425
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,050
for your dad and Su.

426
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,890
Now?

427
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,210
I can just order with my phone.

428
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,370
It's right next door.

429
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,370
Why spend on the delivery fee?

430
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,570
Are you trying to get rid of me?

431
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,490
What?

432
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,290
Lacking confidence in your man?

433
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,890
Of course, that's not the case.

434
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,410
I have my full trust in him.

435
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,090
It'd be a waste not to show off

436
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,930
my beautiful dress today.

437
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,050
Come on, Su.

438
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,050
Here.

439
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,290
Mr. Song.

440
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:16,610
Drinking

441
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,250
in this small cup

442
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,210
doesn't seem fun to you.

443
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,970
Let's switch things up.

444
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,570
Switch things up?

445
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,930
Let's play a game.

446
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,610
Loser takes a shot.

447
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,370
Sounds good.

448
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,290
Sure.

449
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,530
What game?

450
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,850
Mr. Song.

451
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,130
You lost.

452
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:38,930
Fine.

453
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,490
You're good, kid.

454
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,690
Have some water.

455
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,770
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

456
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,450
Come on.

457
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,770
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

458
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,050
I've never once lost

459
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,770
in the many years

460
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,170
I've walked this earth.

461
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,810
I've finally met a worthy opponent.

462
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,770
Easy.

463
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,370
I need a break.

464
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,210
Su.

465
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,570
Do you drink often?

466
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,450
No, Mrs. Song.

467
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,450
Actually, I don't drink much.

468
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,970
The last time I drank was with Xingchen.

469
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,810
I had to make sure she was safe

470
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,890
and didn't get drunk.

471
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
I took some for her.

472
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,130
Maybe that's how my tolerance

473
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,050
became better.

474
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,490
Then,

475
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,930
do you have any secret tricks?

476
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,930
Not really.

477
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,210
Observe your opponent.

478
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,330
Maybe, at times,

479
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,890
some psychological games.

480
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,210
That's about it.

481
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,970
Su, you're a smooth-talker.

482
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,210
What's your age?

483
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,930
I'm 28.

484
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,050
How's your family dynamic?

485
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,530
I'd say we're simple

486
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,600
and harmonious.

487
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,650
Where are you from?
Where's your property?

488
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,170
My hometown is Sucheng,

489
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,290
property in Haicheng.

490
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,010
What do you like about Xingchen?

491
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,770
Everything about her.

492
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,690
Xingchen is flawless.

493
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,170
Sweet talker.

494
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,010
Su.

495
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,290
In the past,

496
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,690
how many women

497
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,770
have you dated?

498
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,450
Yes. How many girlfriends have you had?

499
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,730
Actually, before this,

500
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,850
I never dated anyone.

501
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,370
Xingchen is my first girlfriend.

502
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,410
(Decisive.)

503
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,130
(Liar.)

504
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,770
What are your hobbies?

505
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,410
If I have the time,

506
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,650
I'll exercise,

507
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,410
clean the house, and cook.

508
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,130
He's like me.

509
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,250
Unambitious.

510
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,170
Where did you graduate from?

511
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,330
Mr. and Mrs. Song.

512
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,970
You might not have heard of it.

513
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,250
I graduated
from the International Security Academy.

514
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:58,570
Where...

515
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,540
I majored in counter-terrorism.

516
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,010
- Counter-terrorism?
- Counter-terrorism?

517
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,290
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Song.

518
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,010
Give me a moment.

519
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,290
Is counter-terrorism

520
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,130
very dangerous?

521
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,210
Of course.

522
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,090
Mr. and Mrs. Song.

523
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,010
This is a record of my personal history.

524
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,370
You can have a look.

525
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:30,650
Okay.

526
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,870
(UN Safety and Security
Training Camp Certificate)

527
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,460
(Medal of Valor
for saving the Thai people)

528
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:38,760
(UNICEF Certificate of Recognition)

529
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,060
(Bachelor of Arts Certificate
United International Security College)

530
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,940
(Certificate of Award
for Outstanding Contribution.)

531
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,210
Award for Outstanding Contribution.

532
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,290
Mrs. Song.

533
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,090
Mr. Song.

534
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,930
This is a card

535
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,450
for my savings,

536
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,530
along with what I earn
from other investments.

537
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,690
I believe I can provide for Xingchen

538
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,770
a happy and fulfilling life.

539
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,530
Wait.

540
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,490
We're not family yet.

541
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,170
You can leave your records

542
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,570
with us.

543
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,370
But please put the card away.

544
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:15,770
Yes.

545
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,890
We're not short on cash.

546
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,730
On his resume,

547
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,890
he listed everything.

548
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,650
What else do you want me to ask?

549
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,250
You're a coward.

550
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,050
Let me do it.

551
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,370
Su.

552
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,370
Just what is it

553
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,490
that your rescue team do?

554
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,610
Well,

555
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,330
we go everywhere.

556
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,490
We go wherever we're needed.

557
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,330
Simply put, we help others.

558
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,710
We're a non-profit organization.

559
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,650
Non-profit?

560
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,170
That means

561
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,170
he earns nothing.

562
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,610
Non-profit organization.

563
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,090
Is the job

564
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,330
unstable

565
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,770
and

566
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,370
full of dangers?

567
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:18,650
Dad.

568
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:20,890
Sober up.

569
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,890
Interrogation done?

570
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:25,810
Well,

571
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:26,530
we were

572
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,570
just chatting with him.

573
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,450
Xingchen.

574
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,220
Look at your dad.

575
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,530
He had too much to drink.
He needs to sleep.

576
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,010
Send Su home as well.

577
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:36,810
Yes.

578
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,290
It's time for us to rest.

579
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,410
Still,

580
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,170
you must get someone to drive you.

581
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,490
Don't drink and drive. Hear me?

582
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,210
The driver will be here soon.

583
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,330
I'll walk him out.

584
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:47,810
Okay.

585
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,330
Let's go.

586
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,530
Mr. and Mrs. Song, I'll be going now.

587
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,530
Goodbye.

588
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,450
Goodbye.

589
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,570
Amazing, Su.

590
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,730
When did you
develop a high alcohol tolerance?

591
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,490
I had to.

592
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,410
If I wasn't prepared,

593
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,210
I wouldn't dare
walk into your scary home.

594
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:09,490
True.

595
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,650
Wait. Why...

596
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,490
Why is my body heating up?

597
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,450
Good.

598
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,290
Why is it good?

599
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,170
If you drank all those herbs

600
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,650
and you're still not heating up,

601
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,410
it would mean your body was weak.

602
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,490
I exercise everyday. How can I be weak?

603
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:30,970
I don't know.

604
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,890
Slowly.

605
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,330
This meal

606
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,250
felt like a battle.

607
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,250
What do you think of Su?

608
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,170
I think he's quite good.

609
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,610
Not only is he handsome,

610
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,450
but he is also eloquent

611
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,090
and polite.

612
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,290
I didn't think
our daughter could get married

613
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,370
with how she is.

614
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,450
Why were you so harsh on him?

615
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,210
We have to make a show of it.

616
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,770
We don't have a son.

617
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,130
What if he abuses Xingchen later?

618
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,330
I must let him know

619
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,570
Xingchen is not an easy target.

620
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,930
I could tell it.

621
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,810
You're quite happy with Su.

622
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,330
Why else are you

623
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,930
that hard on him?

624
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,130
I have to know what his team does.

625
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,650
Is his job dangerous?

626
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,770
If he's truly a good man,

627
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,690
I will never stop them.

628
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,130
I'm even eager

629
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,210
for them to get married with kids.

630
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,090
I have a list of baby names.

631
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,730
It's enough even for three kids.

632
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,090
That depends
on whether our daughter will marry him.

633
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,450
True.

634
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,930
We'll have to keep observing.

635
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,050
Sorry I'm late, sweetie.

636
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,010
Who are you?

637
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,170
Sorry, miss.

638
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,850
My friend loves the pastries here.

639
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,870
I want to buy her some.

640
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,850
Can you help me?

641
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,370
Pretend we know each other.

642
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,050
Okay.

643
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,170
(Sold Out)
Sorry. We're all sold out today.

644
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,400
Please come back tomorrow.

645
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,890
No way.

646
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,050
It was nearly my turn.

647
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,890
I have one here.

648
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,570
Who wants it?

649
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,570
Highest bid wins.

650
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,530
I want it.

651
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,690
Do you want it?

652
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,460
I'll pay five times the price.

653
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,370
Li.

654
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,980
Why are you here?

655
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,130
Lu Delivery Service. We always deliver.

656
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,810
I have your favorite milk tea

657
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,420
and ice cream.

658
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,410
Milk tea and ice cream?

659
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,220
It's a lot of calories.

660
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,130
Are you fattening me up?

661
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,960
What? I'm doing it to be nice.

662
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,000
You're always working late.

663
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
You've lost weight.
You need to replace the calories.

664
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,560
You really don't need to go on a diet.

665
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,890
You're being slick.

666
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,930
Still, since you're being considerate,

667
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,010
I'll accept it this once.

668
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,530
This is nothing, actually.

669
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,770
There's one more thing.

670
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,210
Their pastries are very limited.

671
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,450
On May 19th,

672
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,410
you published a post,

673
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,500
saying you really want some.

674
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,450
Hence, today,

675
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,330
I battled many men

676
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,200
to get it for you.

677
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,730
You're too kind.

678
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,410
Where's the pastry?

679
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,250
I must have run too fast

680
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,090
it fell on the road.

681
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,250
Wait for me. I'll look for it.

682
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,010
Wait for me.

683
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,970
If you tell me the truth now,

684
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,210
I'll forgive you

685
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,450
since you bought me milk tea

686
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,170
and ice cream.

687
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,650
I really bought one.

688
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,890
I lined up for it since morning.

689
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,730
The pastry's not important,

690
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,250
but how can you lie to me?

691
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,370
I really bought one.

692
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,810
I went early in the morning.

693
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,210
I saw a lot of people there.

694
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,490
If it were anyone else,

695
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,450
I'd believe them

696
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,490
but not you.

697
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:35,810
Get out.

698
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:36,930
Out.

699
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,090
Xiaoli, please believe me.

700
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:39,490
So many people wanted it.

701
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,470
Did you know
I bought it for five times the price?

702
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,170
I'm really, really innocent.

703
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,330
I really bought it.

704
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,090
I really bought it.

705
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,530
Why won't you believe me?

706
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,620
You'll know if you ask the shop staff.

707
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,830
You earned a few points
with the milk tea and ice cream,

708
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,580
but why lie about lining up
for the pastry?

709
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,530
As if I'd believe you.

710
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,210
Xiaoli, why won't you believe me?

711
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,650
I really bought one.

712
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,890
I really bought it.

713
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,450
Can you believe me just once?

714
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,810
How about I show you the receipt?

715
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,930
Xiaoli.

716
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,810
Is everything ready?

717
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,370
Don't worry. It'll go well.

718
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,250
Okay.

719
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,570
You're here.

720
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,090
Thank you for this.

721
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,330
I'll treat you to a meal later.

722
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,210
It's nothing.

723
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,850
You helped me defeat the rumors,

724
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,850
and at the swimming pool,

725
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,210
you risked your life to save me.

726
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,130
It's to pay you back.

727
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,250
Thanks.

728
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,370
Let's go.

729
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:40,740
Let's go.

730
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,050
Hey.

731
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,970
You can't make it?

732
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,850
What about my shooting?

733
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,810
It's called "Half Life",

734
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,570
and I need a male model.

735
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,690
Can you do me a favor?

736
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,610
Take a leave for the shoot later.

737
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,490
Great. It's a deal then.

738
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,410
Hey.

739
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,570
He hung up on me.

740
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,610
What happened?

741
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,770
Your partner can't make it.

742
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,890
You introduced him

743
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,770
and vouched for him.

744
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,690
Call him now.

745
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,330
I...

746
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,050
Bro, why don't you pick me?

747
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,810
You？

748
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,690
Yes, me.

749
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,410
You look beautiful.

750
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,410
I know.

751
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:38,850
Let's go.

752
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,810
I told you, right?

753
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,370
The title of this shoot is "Half Life".

754
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,210
It depicts a couple's journey

755
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,090
from school to work to family,

756
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,570
and then

757
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,250

It was great.

You two exuded a couple vibe.

778
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,650
I'll head out first.

779
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,870
Alright. Thank you for today.

780
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,560

- Bye.

781
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,010
Are you okay?

782
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,210
What's wrong?

783
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,130
My heel broke.

784
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,210
Is your ankle okay?

785
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,250
I'm fine.

786
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,930
I'll carry you.

787
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,770
Get on.

788
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:26,890
Really?

789
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,610
Yeah, come on up.

790
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,410
Hold on tight.

791
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,690
This feels really good.

792
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,130
It's like going back to childhood.

793
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,930
Childhood?

794
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,250
When I was little,

795
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,530
Qingche used to carry me like this.

796
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,090
It felt really secure.

797
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:54,820
How do you feel

798
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,850
after shooting

799
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:56,730
all day?

800
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,450
It felt like a dream.

801
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,970
My senior said you did well

802
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,290
and showed good emotional involvement.

803
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,170
That proves I'm professional.

804
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,250
You were so involved just now.

805
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,010
Did you imagine me as your boy...

806
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,290
Are you crazy?

807
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,130
Why would I be interested in you?

808
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,250
You're scared of things
and can't do much.

809
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,610
You're not manly at all.

810
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,890
I just don't want to owe you anything.

811
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,810
Since it's settled now, we're even.

812
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,050
I mean,

813
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,410
you were involved just now.

814
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,490
Did you imagine me

815
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,130
as Su Qingche?

816
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,770
No way.

817
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,590
He's the captain of a rescue team.

818
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,650
He can do anything.

819
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,770
You're nothing like him.

820
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,090
Did she have to be so worked up?

are all in this document.

825
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,890

are required to join.

827

Volunteers' participation are voluntary.

828
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,490
You can think about it.

829
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,930
You're dismissed. Go get ready.

830
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,250
Understood.

831
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,850
Aren't you signing up?

832
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,410
It's a bit challenging for me, actually.

833
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,290
It's okay.

834
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,850
Just come and watch our training.

835
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,910
We'll be camping in the evening.

836
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,850
There will
be some entertainment activities too.

837
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,570
Just come for fun.

838
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,770
I see

839
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,810
that it's not far
from the Seaside Resort.

840
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,890
It's indeed close.

841
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,980
After going through this itinerary,

842
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,730
I actually have another idea.

843
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,610
What idea?

844
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,210
After I succeed with the first step,

845
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:29,970
I'll tell you.

846
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,470
(Receipt: Cream puffs, 6)

847
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,610
He really went to buy it.

849
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,410

852

Why are you covering your eyes?

853
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,880
Haven't you seen it already?

854
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,050
Are you here to see me?

855
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,730
I was just passing by.

856
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,730
At this late hour?

857
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,410
What if I was away?

858
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,090
I asked Xingchen.

859
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,410
Captain Su said you were around.

860
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,360
But you didn't pick up the phone
when I called.

861
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,210
I was showering downstairs.

862
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,530
You see. My phone is here.

863
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,410
Why

864
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,410
did you come?

865
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,930
Let's talk about it next time.

866
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,890
Wait.

867
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:47,930
Don't go.

868
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,410
Just tell me.

869
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,530
Or I won't be able to sleep.

870
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,130
You can't leave now.

871
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,250
I won't let you leave. Just tell me.

872
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,210
Next time, okay?

873
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:00,650
Hey.

874
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,090
Just tell me.

875
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,130
If you don't move still,

876
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,650
I'll bite you.

877
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,410
Go ahead then.

878
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,450
You came all this way at night
just to bite me?

879
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,610
Xiaoli, just tell me.

880
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:21,970
Xiaoli!

883
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,130

885
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,490

886
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,290

887
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,370
No.

888
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,290
It's

889
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,570
getting a bit complicated.

890
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,450
I think I understand.

891
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,810
Lu Qun is genuinely interested in you.

892
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,170
Yeah.

893
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,930
But do you think

894
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,450
this could be some kind of trick?

895
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,450
Observe him a little more then.

896
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,290
Don't worry.

897
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,970
If he dares to play you,

898
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,410
I won't let him off easy.

899
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,610
I'll cool down

900
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,010
and think about it carefully.

901
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,330
How about this?

902
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,430
I have a booking
at Seaside Resort this weekend.

903
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,760
Come with me to relax.

904
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,450

907
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:51,870
Goodnight.

908
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:52,730
(Okay.)

909
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,010

913
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:13,890
Yeah.

914

Xingchen just called to ask

915
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,730
whether you were at Polar Night.

916
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,570
Yeah. Why did she come?

917
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,810
Didn't you see her?

918
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,810
She didn't tell you why?

919
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,770
No.

920
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,930
She came over

921
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,050
and bit me, then ran away.

922
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,530
