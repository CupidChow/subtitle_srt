34
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,480
Dear.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,370
Food is here. Come and eat.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,370
Sure.

37
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,040
Here you go.

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,040
Looks nice.

39
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:41,970
Oh.

40
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,720
Are you still in contact
with the person last time?

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,010
Who?

42
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,920
The handsome Captain Su.

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,970
Do you still have time
to ask about a man?

44
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,720
Have you seen
this month's performance report?

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,370
There's no conflict in that.

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,010
Buying our shop's products

47
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,810
is the same as choosing a boyfriend.

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,850
Some people like men who are warm.

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Some people like men who are blunt.

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,130
What kind of man do you like?

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,480
I don't think so.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,370
We have

53
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,040
too many products right now.

54
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,090
We sell everything at the shop.

55
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,370
We don't have a focus on our operation.

56
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,760
That is why we can't attract customers.

You keep talking about the products.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,440
What do you plan to do

61
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,970
with that man?

62
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,290
I don't care.

63
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,970
I can't let a man

64
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,410
become an obstacle in my career.

65
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,090
Oh, right. Dear,

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,810
come here.

67
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Let me show you something.

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,720
What's wrong?

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
What do you think about these styles?

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,340
(To Stardust Rouge,
Couple Pajamas Styles)

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,480
Pajamas?

72
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,320
This manufacturer contacted us.

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,640
They have taken a liking
to our sales capability.

74
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
I think these Pajamas

75
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,720
suit couples to buy them.

76
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,130
Let's launch them.

77
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,480
Great!

78
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,580
(Stardust Rouge)

79
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay.

80
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,170
Xingchen.

81
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,610
You look like you are starving.

82
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,570
It feels like
you haven't eaten for days.

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,370
The shop is preparing for an event.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
I ordered food deliveries
in the past few days.

85
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,050
This won't do.

86
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,130
You must take care of your health.

87
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,130
I know, Dad.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Why do I feel like

89
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,370
you are busier than
when you were at the hospital?

90
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,960
We just started.

91
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,610
There are many things
that need to be done

92
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,570
by Xiaoli and me.

94
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,520
Let me answer my phone.

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,810
Hello, Xiaoli.

96
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,280
Yes.

97
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,280
They want to use a new picture

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,730
but the size needs to be adjusted?

99
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,960
All right. I understand.
I'll go back immediately.

100
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,400
Mom. Dad.

101
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,080
I need to go back to the shop.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
I'll come back and eat again
when I'm free.

103
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,690
Love you two.

104
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,490
Finish your meal at least.

105
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,640
It's just wrong.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,200
Why should women sell lingerie?

107
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,010
You are wrong.

108
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,200
They are opening an online store.

109
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,170
They can sell anything.

110
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:31,960
I know that.

111
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,280
It's your daughter's first business.

112
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,370
I'm sure she has to suffer a lot.

113
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm worried too.

114
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,610
How is her online store doing?

115
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,370
Aren't you worried
that her shop might close down?

116
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,250
What about now?

117
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,880
Why don't we go take a look?

118
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,900
(Stardust Rouge)

119
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,370
Look. This is it.

(Stardust Rouge)

121
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,640
Stardust Rouge.

122
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,370
Look at the name.

123
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,810
We came here suddenly

124
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,520
without informing her.

125
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,570
Isn't it a little too abrupt?

126
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,370
What is so abrupt about that?

127
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,400
This is my daughter's shop.

128
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,250
I can come whenever I want.

129
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,880
It's not bad.

130
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,010
What do you mean?

131
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,490
She's busy working.

132
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,320
Xingchen.

133
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,640
Mom. Dad.

134
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,930
Why are you two here?

135
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
We are here to visit you.

136
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,370
What else can we do here?

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,640
Mom, why do you do this again?

138
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,640
Let me say this first.

139
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,690
I didn't come here because I agree

140
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,130
for you to open this shop.

141
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,050
The Song family's rule

142
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,760
is to do your best

143
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,570
in everything you do.

144
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,690
Most importantly, you must promise me

145
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,690
not to let it interfere
with your studies.

146
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,280
Enough. Help them out.

147
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,930
Mom, look.

148
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,440
Isn't this great?

149
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,880
It's pink and nice.

150
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,760
Mr. Song.

151
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,320
Do you want to bring a set back

152
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,280
and seek the feeling of youth?

153
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,200
I can no longer seek youth.

154
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,640
I can only think about it.

155
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,080
You are right.
You and Mrs. Song are both young.

156
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,810
Mr. Song, don't put it inside.
Put it here.

157
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,400
Wait. Put this layer inside first.

158
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,440
Put it on top.

159
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,130
It has been a long time

160
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,280
since we walked together like this.

161
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,760
It's all thanks to you and Mom today.

162
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,880
Otherwise, I'm not sure

163
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,280
when I can finish working.

164
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,610
Xingchen.

165
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,200
It is tough for young people
to start a business

166
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,930
but you need to know your limit.

167
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,930
Mom, I know.

168
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,320
You've said it a dozen times.

169
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,170
Do you think I'm too free?

170
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,050
I know you care about me.

171
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,570
My car is parked in front.

172
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,080
Let me send you two back home.

173
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,930
No need.

174
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,690
You still have many things to do.

175
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Go and do your work.

176
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,010
Sure. Stay safe.

177
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,400
Let me know when you reach home.

178
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,570
- Sure.
- All right. Go and do your work.

179
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,610
Bye.

180
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
What did I say?

181
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,730
(International Arrival)

182
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,560
Qingche, you have finally returned.

183
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,450
Here you go.

184
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,970
You look so pale.

185
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,090
You didn't return my WeChat texts.

186
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,520
I'm sure you don't have
enough time to sleep, right?

187
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
I should quickly get a driver's license

188
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
so I can go with you.

189
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,760
I'm worried if you go alone.

190
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,970
I really think

191
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,370
the rescue team needs to get on track.

192
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,370
Otherwise, how can we
keep these volunteers

193
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,490
and attract more people?

194
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,040
Look at our medical team.

195
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,970
They still can't work with us

196
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,040
in rescue operations until now.

197
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,520
After participating in
an international joint operation abroad,

198
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,730
I deeply feel

199
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,640
that we are not professional enough.

200
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,800
Qingche, it's really great

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,920
to have you as captain.

202
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,560
Don't worry.

203
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,850
We can definitely make Polar Night

204
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,250
the most professional team
in the country.

205
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,450
(Song Xingchen, What are you doing?)
but we need to balance work and rest.

206
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
To celebrate your return,

207
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,450
I'll treat you

208
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,560
to a drink. Let's go.

209
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,800
Are you injured?

210
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,760
Is it serious?

211
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm fine.

212
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,370
- Get it examined at the hospital.
- Don't move.

213
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,540
(Song Xingchen, Moments)

214
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,250
Tell me. Why would a girl

215
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,920
hide her Moments from you?

216
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,450
That means she sees you as a stranger

217
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,520
or she doesn't want
to be too close to you.

218
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,880
She doesn't want to develop
her relationship with you any further.

219
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,800
That's about it.

220
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,490
What's wrong?

221
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,210
Who is it?

222
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,640
Dr. Song, right?

223
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't tell me you didn't send her a text

224
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,640
after so many days.

225
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,330
I...

226
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,920
I wanted to send her a text

227
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,280
but

228
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,920
I went to the scene
after I got off the plane.

229
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,970
There was no signal along the way.

230
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,850
Didn't I ask you to tell her?

231
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,010
You didn't tell her.

232
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,920
Didn't you ask me to tell Grandpa...

233
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,450
What did I tell you back then?

234
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,490
I asked you to tell Grandpa
and Song Xingchen

235
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,640
so they could be at ease.

236
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,450
Lu Qun, where's your brain?

237
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,850
You've done it now.

238
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,730
Why don't we go to the hospital?

239
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,490
What are you doing? My car is here.

240
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,210
Don't talk to me!

241
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,490
I get angry when I see you.

242
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,610
Go to the hospital
and get your shoulder checked!

243
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,370
Bring my bag home!

244
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,250
(Haicheng, Taxi)

245
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,520
Head to the yacht pier.

246
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,640
Qingche!

247
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Qingche!

248
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,370
Where has his rationality gone?

249
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,130
Something's wrong with him.

250
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,640
It's wrong.

251
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,680
Sure. I understand.

252
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,450
I'll send you
the event registration form later.

253
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,370
It's our first time
organizing an online event.

254
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,130
We lack experience.

255
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,010
Sure. I'm hanging up.

256
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
What's wrong?

257
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,090
The form is unacceptable
and we need to do it again?

258
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,010
Yes. Sorry to trouble you, Ms. Han.

259
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,560
No problem. Let me rearrange it

260
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,370
and print another copy.

261
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,130
Because of Women's Day,

262
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,450
we need to pack each item separately.

263
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,210
It's so tiring.

264
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,330
Do your best.

265
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm leaving.

266
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,940
(Su Qingche, What are you doing?)

267
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,450
Look out!

268
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,920
Are you all right?

269
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,400
Why are you hurt?

270
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,160
Why did you block me?

271
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,970
How can you think about that now?

272
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,130
Go to the hospital.

273
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,860
(Inpatient Department 1, Emergency)

274
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Do you think

275
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,680
this feels familiar?

276
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,330
You have such a serious wound

277
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,090
and you came to find me
as soon as you got off the plane.

278
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Do you plan to
hurt your shoulder forever?

279
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,210
It wasn't serious

280
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,560
but I got hit just now.

281
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,880
You got hurt to help me.

282
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,090
I will pay for your medical expenses.

283
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,490
You can also tell me
if you need compensation.

284
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,160
No need.

285
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,330
I went to find you to explain.

286
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,560
About what?

287
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,400
That day,

288
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,880
I accepted an emergency rescue mission

289
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
abroad.

290
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,210
I wanted to tell you.

291
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,520
I went to find you
but you weren't there.

292
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,210
I also called you

293
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,920
but you didn't answer.

294
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,330
When I was on my way,

295
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,800
I kept calling the people over there

296
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
to communicate the rescue situation.

297
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,040
I also sent you a text

298
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
but my phone ran out of battery.

299
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,680
I didn't know
whether I sent you the text or not.

300
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,450
I purposely asked Lu Qun

301
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,370
to tell you after he went back.

302
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
I didn't expect him to be so unreliable.

303
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,560
It's not that you didn't expect it.

304
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,850
You've overthought.

305
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,330
What do you mean?

306
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,450
Even if I didn't tell you immediately,

307
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,850
it doesn't mean I don't prioritize you.

308
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,160
There's no need to tell me.

309
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,680
Who am I to you?

310
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,250
Teammate?

311
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,610
Why are you being so unreasonable?

312
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,850
Have you seen a reasonable woman before?

313
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,280
Who are you? What are you doing?

314
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,610
What are you doing?

315
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,010
Eavesdropping on others?

316
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I am eavesdropping? You...

317
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,450
You are Song Xingchen's friend, right?

318
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,520
Who are you?

319
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,370
I am Qingche's friend, Lu Qun.

320
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,330
Hello.

321
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,970
Lu Qun?

322
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,560
What a green
and environmentally friendly name.

323
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,760
However, what you just did

324
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,010
was immoral.

325
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
We get to know each other through this.

326
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,850
This must be for Qingche, right?

327
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,880
Actually,

328
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,010
I saw you sticking your head inside.

329
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,160
You are quite curious about it, right?

330
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,640
Why don't we...

331
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,160
I know.

332
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,880
I know you are angry about it, right?

333
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,520
You are angry
that I didn't send you a text.

334
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,680
Don't overestimate yourself.

335
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,160
I haven't deleted you.

336
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,850
It means
there's no need to care about this

337
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,760
with the relationship we have.

338
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,090
Even if you delete me,

339
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,130
I will still think of a way to find you.

340
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,370
Why do you want to look for me?

341
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,970
I need a doctor's advice.
You are a doctor.

342
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,760
If my injury can't heal...

343
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,490
Who are you trying to fool
with your physique?

344
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,400
We didn't owe each other in the past

345
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,370
and we are not related now.

346
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,920
What do you mean by
we don't owe each other?

347
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,010
You still owe me a meal.

348
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,330
Are you here to beg for food?

349
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,880
Can you speak nicely?

350
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
Am I not speaking nicely?

351
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,090
Fine. When you are discharged,

352
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,120
Just pick any place you want.

353
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,850
Let me see.

354
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,370
Don't move
if you don't want a reverse blood flow.

355
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,210
Does it hurt?

356
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,090
Let go.

357
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,920
Don't be angry, all right?

358
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,130
Why do you care?

359
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,520
If you are angry,

360
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,730
I won't be able to get you to treat me.

361
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,040
Let go.

362
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,680
(Sometimes, acting weak
is also a type of strategy.)

363
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,600
Why do I suddenly feel...

364
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,080
My wound hurts.

365
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,170
Instructor Su
is actually acting pitiful.

366
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,040
I should let your subordinates

367
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,360
see what you look like now.

368
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,040
Don't move.

369
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,760
Lie down.

370
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Even a reverse flow of blood

371
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,730
can't kill someone like you.

372
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,650
He knows how to apply what he learned.
How promising.

373
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,730
He is good. One extra point.

374
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,690
Handsome. Two extra points.

375
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,010
However, his stamina is not good.
Three points deducted.

376
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
My friend just returned from a mission.

377
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,650
He is also injured.

378
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,360
Besides,

379
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,010
he saw your friend deleting his contact

380
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,970
after he got off the plane

381
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,520
and rushed here immediately.

382
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,010
I see.

383
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,080
Since he has saved Xingchen

384
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,040
a few times,

385
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,010
he is reliable.

386
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,690
Ten extra points.

387
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,930
Perfect score? That's not bad.

388
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,490
It's out of 100.

389
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,320
Miss.

390
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,410
Look at how sincere my buddy is.

391
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,730
Don't be so strict.

392
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,490
Hands off me.

393
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,170
Let's talk it out and not touch me.

394
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,760
It's a sign of being friendly

395
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,890
since we are both scientists.

396
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,600
Right?

397
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,280
Forget it.

398
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,320
Please keep a suitable boundary.

399
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,700
(Super Handsome Guy)

400
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,120
Hello.

401
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,690
(Hello.)

402
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,490
(Where are you?)

403
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,210
(I just finished work)

404
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,560
(I'll get changed and go find you.)

405
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,650
There's no need. I'm busy today.

406
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
(We agreed to meet.)

407
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,210
(Wait for me.)

408
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,450
I'm not at work.

409
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,410
I'm at Beicheng Hospital.

410
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,840
(What's wrong?)

411
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm fine. I'll explain to you later.

412
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:10,890
I'm hanging up.

413
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,320
Who is it?

414
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,560
Didn't you see it?

415
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,930
Is that your kink, Dr. Song?

416
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,450
Don't try to mock me.

417
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,210
Is my kink related to you?

418
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,490
What are you doing?

419
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,080
Why are you here?

420
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,360
Why didn't you tell me Song Xingchen
has been admitted to the hospital?

421
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,520
She...

422
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,930
Who is he?

423
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,930
He is the patient's friend.

424
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Both of you were so close together.

425
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,730
I thought you finally had a relationship
after being single for so long.

426
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,040
Don't you know
how to keep your mouth shut?

427
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,600
I am Xingchen's best friend after all.

428
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,120
Sir,

429
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,040
please keep quiet at the hospital.

430
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,280
Who are you? Why are you here?

431
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,280
I'm here to look for Song Xingchen.

432
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,280
Do you think I'm here for you?

433
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,080
I want to see

434
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,930
who is bullying my Song Xingchen.

435
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Song Xingchen.

436
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,080
What are you wearing?

437
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,170
Are you all right?

438
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,410
I'm fine.

439
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,540
(Inpatient Department 1, Emergency)

440
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,690
I understand everything now.

441
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,490
Tell me.
How much compensation are you asking?

442
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
I'll help you.

443
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,800
You need to ask him.

444
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
Name your price.

445
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,760
Cut the nonsense.

446
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,730
Who are you?

447
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,650
I should be asking you.

448
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,250
Why did you go to her shop at night?

449
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,410
What is the relationship
between you two?

450
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,760
Who are you to care?

451
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,490
Your expression is too obvious.

452
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,450
You are obviously enjoying this.

453
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Song Xingchen, I'm asking you.

454
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,930
Who is this brat to you?

455
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,690
- He is my
- Answer nicely.

456
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,040
- good friend.
- Good girl.

457
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,490
(What a pity, Qingche is late.)

458
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:14,930
Enough.

459
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,840
If you are fine,

460
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,970
we won't disturb you anymore.

461
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:18,840
I'll go pay the bills.

462
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,840
No need.

463
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,210
You got injured because of me.

464
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,120
I don't want to owe you.

465
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,560
Let's go.

466
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,560
Take good care of yourself alone.

467
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,080
Bye.

468
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,360
Che,

469
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,690
you acted
without doing a background check.

470
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,690
This isn't like you.

471
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,560
No. Who is he?

472
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,280
Why would Song Xingchen

473
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,450
fall for someone like him?

474
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,490
The name saved on her phone

475
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,560
was "Super Handsome Guy".

476
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,450
No. Do you think he is even handsome?

477
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,600
Well,

478
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,450
both of you look similar,

479
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,690
you have the same hairstyle

480
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,010
and similar height. It's just...

481
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,890
We have different fashion styles, right?

482
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:03,970
You are right.

483
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,250
You are just a little worse than him.

484
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,890
Tell me honestly.
What is your relationship with him?

485
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,760
Teammate.

486
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,840
Teammate?

487
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,520
Call it the Summoner's Rift instead.

488
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,040
Tell me.

489
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,360
Both of them

490
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,250
met on a blind date.

491
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,730
Great Aunt Xiaofang
arranged a blind date for you?

492
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,930
Why didn't I know about him?

493
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,360
Do I need to tell you everything?

494
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,010
My nephew.

495
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,760
Stop calling me your nephew.

496
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,490
This will be my embarrassment for life.

497
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,690
When did your contact

498
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,760
in my phone

499
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,280
become "Super Handsome Guy"?

500
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,280
Did you do it?

501
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,650
It was the last time.

502
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,650
You didn't want to do it

503
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,120
so I had to do it myself.

504
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,170
I am your aunt. We are relatives.

505
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,600
This is not right.

506
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,250
We don't have a big gap in age.

507
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,800
Do you think you are the Dragon Lady?

508
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,120
If you say another word,

509
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,970
I'll tell your mother that you failed.

510
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,410
You...

511
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,490
Even a tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

512
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,120
How can you bring yourself to harm

513
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,410
your cute and handsome nephew?

514
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,170
You finally admit it.

515
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,840
When I heard something happened to you,

516
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,250
I rushed here

517
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,040
without changing

518
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,080
after my singing competition.

519
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,360
How dare you scold me?

520
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,970
Enough. Look in front and drive.

521
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,180
(Certificate of Honor, Song Xingchen,
Best Art Award in County Art Exhibition)

522
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,060
(Certificate of Honor, Song Xingchen,
Haicheng City Go Tournament "Emerging Go Player")

523
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:55,930
Dear.

524
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,520
I realised this little thing

525
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,170
is good
for massaging your pressure points.

526
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,450
It works better
if you use it with this body lotion.

527
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,600
Let me try it.

528
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,650
Seriously, it's quite useful.

529
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Of course.

530
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,970
Dear.

531
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,490
I think it's possible
between you and Captain Su.

532
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,690
Don't you want to give it a try?

533
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,250
I hate people
who leave without saying goodbye.

534
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,970
Actually, it's understandable

535
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,930
if it was an urgent mission.

536
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,250
Of course, I know that.

537
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,250
Does it mean

538
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,490
he passed this stage?

539
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,280
I didn't say that.

540
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,360
However,

541
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,890
I don't want to start a relationship

542
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,560
at this moment.

543
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,970
Making money and furthering my studies
is my main goal.

544
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,970
It has been so long

545
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,450
since your last relationship
with Tang Ruize.

546
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,360
You know a lot of theory

547
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,320
but your real experience is just

548
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,280
a little better than mine.

549
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,800
Just a little?

550
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,560
Don't underestimate me.

551
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
I might surprise you one day.

552
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,600
Fine.

553
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,600
Love is just something extra in life.

554
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,700
Besides,

555
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,650
I have no time to be in a relationship.

556
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,490
Apart from managing the shop,

557
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
I still need to study when I go back.

558
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,730
It's all my fault.

559
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,760
It's all my fault.

560
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,600
Dear, why don't I

561
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,040
give you a massage?

562
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,650
I don't blame you.

563
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,450
I shouldn't say that.

564
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,040
You shouldn't say that
in the future too.

565
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,890
It harms our relationship.

566
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,520
Sure.

567
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,210
Also, this is

568
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,800
our first online festive event.

569
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,730
It's a good opportunity
to push the shop's sales.

570
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,760
We must be motivated.

571
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,120
That's right.

572
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,040
However, we still need to think about
how we are going to do the marketing.

573
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,280
How can we be outstanding?

574
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,320
Doesn't Qian Cheng have a class

575
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,490
about marketing recently?

576
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,320
Let's ask him.

577
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,840
He studies New Media.

578
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,560
That is just his homework.

579
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,490
Do you think he can help us?

580
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,970
You won't know if you don't try.

581
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,040
Besides, it's a waste to not use him.

582
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,520
Really?

583
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,490
That brat. I'll think about it.

584
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,810
This is good. It's not bad.

585
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,460
(Safety knowledge)

586
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,520
A pretty lady?

587
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,170
Qingche, you are back.

588
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,890
Do you have nothing to do?

589
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,490
Since you came back,

590
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,450
I asked him to help me

591
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,080
clean your office.

592
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,170
Is that the reason

593
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,800
for hiding inside my office

594
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,450
and watching videos of pretty girls?

595
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,210
No.

596
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,690
It's the algorithm.

597
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,560
The video just appeared
when we were browsing.

598
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,690
Algorithm?

599
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,930
Why didn't the algorithm
show it to me instead?

600
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,600
Perhaps it's because
you've never had a girlfriend.

601
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,450
I should watch it too.

602
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,690
(It's dangerous around a lake.)

603
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,800
(Children should
keep a safe distance from it.)

604
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,560
(Understand?)

605
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,450
There's a rectification meeting today.

606
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,490
Is everyone here?

607
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,730
I've informed everyone.

608
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,490
We haven't set a time yet.

609
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,730
Tell them to gather in the meeting room.

610
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,280
Sure.

611
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,210
Let's go.

612
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,560
Everyone! The meeting will begin soon!

613
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,560
(There's a good way
to prevent drowning.)

614
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:33,690
(Children should remember it well.)

615
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,080
(It's best to have
an adult to accompany you.)

616
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,930
(Swimming alone is dangerous.)

617
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,890
(Drowning prevention
is important to children.)

618
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,970
(Safety is important to children.)

619
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,210
My rescue abroad

620
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,490
has given me an inspiration.

621
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,730
It's that the public

622
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,650
still has low recognition
of Polar Night.

623
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,360
Why does the situation exist?

624
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,490
I think

625
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,410
it's because we lack promotion methods
that advance with the times.

626
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Look at this video.

627
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,250
On the surface,

628
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,520
it's a pretty girl dancing.

629
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,410
Actually, the video is using her

630
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,730
to capture everyone's attention.

631
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,970
However, it talks about

632
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,760
general safety.

633
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,760
This is getting twice the result
with half the effort

634
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,040
as I've always mentioned.

635
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,800
Captain Su.

636
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,800
We are a non-profit organization.

637
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,360
It's not right to do this.

638
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,320
How is it bad?
Look at the number of views.

639
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,690
I don't think this is difficult.

640
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,360
Public water regions are dangerous.

641
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,650
Yes. Record everything

642
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,170
and post it on our public account.

643
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,560
There's a good way to prevent drowning.

644
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,890
Children should remember it well.

645
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,610
Drowning prevention
is important to children.

646
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,490
Captain Lu, you did great.

647
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:52,800
Don't film me.

648
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,360
Don't stop. Keep dancing.

649
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,080
Keep dancing.

650
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,600
I can't do it. Go away.

651
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,160
I'm sure I can't do this.

652
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:58,760
I understand.

653
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,690
We are trying to use short videos

654
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,450
to promote Polar Night.

655
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,320
You are right.

656
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,520
If we lack promotion,

657
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
people can't find us
even if they need help.

658
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,450
In terms of rescue,

659
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,690
whether it's reporting through phone,

660
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,330
Weibo or our public account,

661
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,730
people should know more about it.

662
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,010
The question is

663
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,010
who should we use for our content?

664
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,730
I think

665
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,600
if they have a pretty girl,

666
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,450
we have a young man with abs.

667
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,250
Why don't I do it?

668
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
Do you think I'm good enough?

669
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,250
They attract people.

670
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,730
You are hurting people's eyes.

671
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,280
Didn't you say
you like a man with muscles?

672
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,210
I eat eight eggs every day.

673
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,280
Don't look at me.

674
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,520
Don't look at me.

675
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,690
Lin Mu and Ding Weiling are good.

676
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,520
Look at them. A tough couple. How great.

677
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,760
No. I think you are better.

678
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,010
He can go solo.

679
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,840
Am I right?

680
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,250
- Stop cheering.
- Yes!

681
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,210
I can't do it.

682
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,520
All right, it's decided!

683
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,730
Everything starts off difficult.

684
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,760
We still need to take the first step.

685
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,800
Lu Qun, you will do it.

686
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,800
Prepare your dance.

687
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,970
Dismissed!

688
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,760
- All right!
- I... You...

689
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,970
Captain Lu, write your own script.

690
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,840
Take your first step with courage!

691
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,540
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

692
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,250
What is it?
Do you have something else to say?

693
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,250
Remember to do

694
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
what I just told you to soon.

695
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,760
I will do that.

696
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,280
I have something more important.

697
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,170
Do you know

698
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,080
who the guy from last night was?

699
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,120
I'm not interested.

700
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
You need to be interested.

701
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,280
Qian Cheng.

702
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,040
A university student
who majors in New Media.

703
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,120
He is good at photography.

704
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,380
(New Media major)

705
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
(Name: Qian Cheng, Haicheng University)

706
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,280
I still don't get it.

707
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,970
Why would she be interested

708
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,760
in a brat like him?

709
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:11,840
Right now,

710
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,650
this is called a caring guy.

711
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,010
Delicate, clean, and young.

712
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,040
It makes people want to protect him.

713
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,080
People like you are a dull guy.

714
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,080
Although you are both guys,

715
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,250
you need to show your strength.

716
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,690
A usual method won't work

717
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,010
on a girl like Song Xingchen.

718
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,450
What do you mean?

719
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,490
There are tricks to pursuing a girl.

720
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,970
There isn't a girl who cannot be pursued

721
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,800
but only a guy who is lazy.

722
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,690
Fine. I get it.

723
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,840
I think she is

724
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,170
a great match
with the Super Handsome Guy.

725
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,970
Enough.

726
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,320
Do you think I don't know
if you are interested in her?

727
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,490
What do you know?

728
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,450
If you want to pursue her,

729
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,890
you need to be interested in her career

730
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,730
and show her more of yourself.

731
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,010
Then, you'll have a common topic.

732
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,650
Let go.

733
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,450
No.

734
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,970
Besides, a girl like Song Xingchen

735
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,210
has strong self-esteem

736
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,410
and is career-minded.

737
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,760
You need to always pay attention to her

738
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,080
and make her think
you are cute and reliable.

739
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,520
That is how you can pursue her.

740
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,320
If you don't let go,

741
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,560
I will post the video of your dance

742
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,840
to the official account of Polar Night.

743
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,010
You must face your heart.

744
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,490
We must never lose to the caring guy.

745
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,360
Fine. I know. All right?

746
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,250
Why is being in a relationship

747
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,040
more difficult than a rescue?

748
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,080
(Dull guy?)

749
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,380
(How does a dull guy pursue a woman?)

750
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,690
The algorithm
is eavesdropping on me again.

751
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,520
Captain Su.

752
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,650
Qin.

753
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,930
Qin.

754
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,210
Is the repairing toolbox with you?

755
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,490
It's with me. Why do you need it?

756
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,280
Just give it to me.

757
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,410
Let me find it for you.

758
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,060
(Polar Night Rescue)

759
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:01,930
Give it to me.

760
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,080
Thank you.

761
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,890
(Qian Cheng, are you free?)

762
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,200
(I have something to ask you
about marketing.)

763
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,040
Why are you here?

764
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,370
Isn't the rack broken?

765
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,720
Did you just humble yourself

766
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,330
to fix the rack?

767
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,410
Helping out for no reason.
You must have an ulterior motive.

768
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,970
I shouldn't argue with you
at the hospital.

769
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,890
I did not reply to your text indeed.

770
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,290
It was my fault.

771
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,680
Everyone,

772
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,450
we are going to talk
about light and shadow today.

773
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,370
Let's look at

774
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,490
the basic parameters

775
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,160
(Qian Cheng, are you free? I have
something to ask you about marketing.)

776
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,890
of these two pictures.

777
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,370
Look. The color is different.

778
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,120
The ISO for this is 800.

779
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,890
This is 1,500.

780
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,410
It's not necessary.

781
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,010
Actually,

782
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,160
my attitude was bad that day.

783
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,930
If you think you can't accept

784
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,080
my help,

785
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,930
just give me a box

786
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,770
as thanks.

787
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,680
That is expensive, all right?

788
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
You should

789
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,930
help me tighten the screws
on the other racks as well.

790
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,890
Mr. Su.

791
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,970
That's what I'm thinking of.

792
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,760
(Qian Cheng,
I'm in class. If it is urgent,)

793
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,060
(I have a senior in marketing
who is throwing a party tonight.)

794
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,360
(I'll inform her.
You can go there yourself.)

795
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,860
(I'm just a student.
She is a real marketing genius.)

796
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,810
Mr. Su.

797
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,370
Why don't you fix the rack another day?

798
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,640
What's wrong?

799
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,450
Did you drive today?

800
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,490
I did.

801
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,200
I have something to do tonight

802
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,120
but Xiaoli went
to look for the supplier and...

803
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,040
I'll drive you.

804
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,370
Not bad. You've become more conscious.

805
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,720
Shouldn't your eyes be on the road?

806
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,080
Well, after you got in,

807
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,410
you didn't tell me where you were going.

808
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,120
How can I drive?

809
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,200
Just drive straight on this road.

810
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,120
I'll give you the directions.

811
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,420
(Qian Cheng,
Young man and young ladies...)

812
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,080
Qian Cheng?

813
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,080
Yes.

814
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,120
How do you know his name is Qian Cheng?

815
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,970
I will find out
if I want to know who he is.

816
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,930
Where are you going so late at night?

817
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,490
You won't tell me.

818
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,200
Do you think I'll kidnap you?

819
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,080
You don't need the GPS
when you are with me.

820
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,120
Turn right at the junction in front.

821
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:32,260
(S86 CLUB)

822
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:33,850
It's so late at night

823
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,970
yet you are going inside this place?

824
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,010
Where else did you think I would go?

825
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,810
The library?

826
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,680
Thank you, Driver.

827
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,770
Well, you are alone...

828
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,370
It's not safe.

829
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:18,890
Hello.

830
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,600
Where are you?

831
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,640
Are you Xingchen?

832
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,240
Yes.

833
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,890
Qian Cheng told me about you.

834
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,520
I want to ask you

835
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,890
about my shop's marketing.

836
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,120
Are you free today?

837
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,410
Let's talk after this song.

838
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:40,810
Sure.

839
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,370
What are you doing? Go away.

840
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,330
Why are you here?

841
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,930
I'm here to have fun.

842
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,160
Here to have fun?

843
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,490
Why did you chase him away?

844
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,490
The man couldn't
keep his hands to himself.

845
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,930
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

846
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,490
Come out with me.

847
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,600
What are you doing?

848
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,200
Why do you come here?

849
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,720
I'm here to ask for help.

850
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,600
What help?

851
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,770
I'm here to ask for help

852
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,720
with my shop's marketing, all right?

853
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,810
Why are you here?

854
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,850
I'm also here for the same purpose.

855
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,890
You?

856
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,160
What help do you need?

857
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,290
New media promotion.

858
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,930
Sure. Suit yourself.

859
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,010
Xingchen, is he your friend?

860
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:57,890
Yes.

861
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,890
Let's have fun in the room.

862
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,770
Come with me.

863
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,120
Let's welcome our new friends.

864
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:10,890
Cheers!

865
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,120
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

866
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,040
We have a rule here.

867
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,450
A newcomer must first drink three shots.

868
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,450
No problem.

869
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,040
I'm here to ask for everyone's help.

870
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,720
Please show mercy.

871
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,560
Let me do it.

872
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,640
What are you doing?

873
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,560
I'm thirsty.

874
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,080
Next up, Rock, Paper, Scissors.

875
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,370
The loser will drink a shot.

876
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,330
- Come on.
- Come.

877
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Rock, paper, scissors!

878
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,010
Let me drink.

879
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,200
I'll drink for her after this.

880
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,520
Come.

881
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,330
Rock, paper, scissors.

882
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,640
I told you not to act tough.

883
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,600
How long should a broadcast be?

884
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,680
It should be around three to four hours.

885
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,410
Just two people?

886
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,520
There's also the cameraman.

887
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,370
You can get this much with three people?

888
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,720
Amazing.

889
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,810
Oh, the most amazing thing is...

890
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,640
Yes. That's exactly the case.

891
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,680
Right? I told you so.

892
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,120
It's...

893
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,040
What are you doing?

894
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,040
What are you doing?

895
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,520
Why are you so close to the guy?

896
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,770
Which guy?

897
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,290
That guy.

898
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,450
Are you jealous?

899
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,560
No.

900
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,160
You drink whiskey as if it was water.

901
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,720
You must be drunk now.

902
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,410
I'm not drunk.

903
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Tell me.

904
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,080
Why did you go to my shop just now

905
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,970
to help me fix the rack?

906
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,370
I want to see you.

907
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,080
Why did you follow me

908
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,930
to this place?

909
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm worried about you.

910
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,600
Stop pretending.

911
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,490
Do you think you are good at drinking?

912
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,560
Fine.

913
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,120
Since you drank on my behalf,

914
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,970
I'll send you back.

915
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,010
