=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 15=

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,740
Grandpa, do you want another round?

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,700
Forget it.
You go back and think about it.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,340
Let's play next time.

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,180
I made tea for you.

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,740
Okay.

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,860
What tea is this?

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,100
This one is dandelion tea.

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,340
It cools the heat.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,860
I heard you coughing just now.

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,180
So I picked some in the yard.

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,420
See.

35
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,070
It's convenient to have a person at home
who studies medicine.

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,140
Thank you.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,260
You're welcome.

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,940
This tastes excellent.

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,300
Excellent.

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,220
As long as you like it.

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,460
Come on. Let's talk about your store.

42
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,260
So, are you managing it alone?

43
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,820
It's a small business.
Just me and my partner.

44
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,620
It'll be a bit hard
with just a few people.

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,900
But the updates are still quick, right?

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,860
Yes. We're an agent for a brand.

47
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,140
As long as their products are suitable,

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,390
we'll release them all for sale.

49
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,900
Running this kind of online store,

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,220
you have to be careful
with your propaganda line.

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,500
Expressing self-love is good,
but at the same time,

52
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,460
you should guide young people

53
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,300
toward a healthy and proper lifestyle.

54
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,180
Grandpa,
you've followed my store?

55
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,780
How could that be?

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,660
I'm so old.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,240
I stopped thinking
about these things a long time ago.

58
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,860
I'm just

59
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,180
offering some friendly advice.

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,940
Nowadays, there are a lot
of young people on the internet.

61
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,300
In your choice of words,

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,460
you must be precise.

63
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,380
Precise.

64
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,540
Okay, so,

65
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,140
I'm a curious person.

66
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,020
You were doing well at your job,

67
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,380
so why did you quit to open this store?

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,900
The previous job...

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,700
wasn't pleasant.

70
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,700
So I quit.

71
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,620
Quit when it's unpleasant.

72
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,260
How many times
will you quit in your life then?

73
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,380
Grandpa, it's not like that.

74
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,620
Xingchen

75
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,680
resigned because the head
of the department before

76
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,780
was pushing for excessive treatments
for performance quotas.

77
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,460
She couldn't stand it, so she quit.

78
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,300
When the quota goes up,
the bonuses increase.

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,380
What's wrong with that?

80
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,860
Doctors are different
from other professions.

81
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,620
It's not just a means of making money.

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,190
It's not taking advantage
of others' misfortune to make a profit.

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,630
It's about saving patients

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,060
from illness and pain

85
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,420
and enabling each mother

86
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,740
to safely give birth to a healthy baby.

87
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,980
That sense of achievement
is what I pursue.

88
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,700
You're right.

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,700
You and Qingche
share the same opinion in this.

90
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,660
So?

91
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,260
Are you going
to continue operating this store?

92
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,940
That's my current plan.

93
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,540
Once the store is stable,

94
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,460
then I can make money.

95
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,530
With money,
I can pay my own tuition fees.

96
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,460
You still want to continue your studies?

97
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,780
Yes. Learn while practicing.

98
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,420
Moreover, if I can earn money,

99
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,960
just in case Qingche runs out of money,

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,860
I can support him.

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,300
That's not necessary.

102
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,260
Qingche is not someone who freeloads.

103
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,780
But what you said makes sense.

104
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,980
As for the rescue team,
the salary isn't high.

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,220
Working long-term
doesn't make ends meet.

106
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,460
What do you think?

107
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,740
Grandpa.

108
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,940
I'm also a member of the rescue team.

109
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,100
What do you think?

110
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,300
This tastes excellent.

111
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,540
What do you think? Pretty good, right?

112
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,220
It has to be you.

113
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,300
Of course.

114
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,980
I feel like you've successfully

115
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,580
touched Grandpa's heart.

116
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,900
Really?

117
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,460
Your room is right here.

118
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,810
My room is next to yours.

119
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,120
If anything happens, just call me.

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,620
If it gets cold at night,
turn on the air conditioner yourself.

121
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,380
Don't catch a cold.

122
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:43,820
Okay.

123
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,380
Also, about what Grandpa said earlier,

124
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,820
don't take it to heart.

125
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,900
You know old people.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,850
Their ability to accept
is different from ours.

127
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,870
(This design is too explicit,
not suitable for young people.)

128
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,140
A red heart toward the sun?

129
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,260
I remember now.

130
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,220
Remember what?

131
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,060
I think your grandpa

132
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,420
might be a customer in my store.

133
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,700
Are you kidding? That's impossible.

134
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,620
It's true.

135
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,860
What's his account name again?

136
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,540
A red heart toward the sun.

137
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,620
He even placed an order.

138
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,260
No way. Why would he shop in your store?

139
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,870
I guess he was probably
doing a background check.

140
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,820
Old Mr. Su.

141
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,090
What do you think
of this granddaughter-in-law?

142
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,220
How do you feel about her?

143
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,230
The prosperity of a family
depends on the daughter-in-law.

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,660
You're in for a good future.

145
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,500
Tell Qingche to be vigilant.

146
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,550
Don't miss this chance.

147
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,380
This lady is kind and sensible.

148
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,140
And the key is that her values

149
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,380
align well with Qingche.

150
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,620
She's good-looking too.

151
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,180
Pretty.

152
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,780
And tall.

153
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,420
Currently, I can't find any faults.

154
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,780
Look how satisfied you are.

155
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,580
Don't bring those rules from the team

156
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,700
to discipline Qingche.

157
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,340
The young man has grown up.

158
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,460
No matter how big he is,
he's still my grandson.

159
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,260
If he needs discipline,
I'll discipline him.

160
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,760
If he needs guidance, I'll guide him.

161
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,220
Yes. You're right.

162
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,180
Alright, you've had a busy day.

163
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,900
Go rest now.

164
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,740
Okay. You should rest early too.

165
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,540
Sure.

166
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,900
This tastes excellent.

167
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,420
This is not working.

168
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,940
Is it broken?

169
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,820
It's so cold.

170
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,220
(Han Xiaoli)

171
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,340
Hello?

172
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,820
(How was it?
Was it exciting to meet his parents?)

173
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,580
Meet what parents?

174
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,420
I'm just staying for a day.

175
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,940
Don't I know you well enough?

176
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
If you don't want to,

177
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,620
who can make you move?

178
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,340
Don't mention it.

179
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,340
After coming here,

180
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,100
I played mahjong and Go.

181
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
I've used every skill I have.

182
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,180
Have you
controlled your true abilities?

183
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,860
Lax on training.

184
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,100
I almost couldn't resist
in one round of Go.

185
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,820
Thanks to your and Lu Qun's reminders.

186
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,140
But I think
enhancing mutual understanding

187
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,100
is actually quite good.

188
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,060
Can you check an account for me?

189
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,780
It's called
"A red heart toward the sun".

190
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,140
Wait a moment.

191
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,820
(A red heart toward the sun)
This account bought a beauty eraser.

192
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,460
Check the address.

193
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,900
The address is Baile Street,
Yong'an Town, Sucheng City.

194
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,700
This is the address
of the Su family's old house.

195
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,460
(It seems)

196
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,500
that Old Mr. Su
is the one keeping a low profile.

197
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,060
Really, Grandpa?

198
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,740
You scare me.

199
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,060
Why are you standing here?

200
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,300
My water heater is broken.

201
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,500
I'm going to the bathroom
to take a shower.

202
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,060
What is he trying to do? All sneaky.

203
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
It's too cold.

204
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,140
Su Qingche, the air conditioner
in this room seems to be broken.

205
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,300
Hurry and come save me.
I'm freezing to death.

206
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,180
Reply to my message.

207
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,100
What's going on?

208
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,100
(Calling Su Qingche)

209
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,060
Qingche, are you there?

210
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,380
Where is he?

211
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,900
Oops, sorry.

212
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,260
Grandpa really bought it.

213
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,860
I saw it in his room.

214
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,900
I knew it.

215
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,790
Why are you here?

216
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,580
Qingche.

217
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,560
Hide for a moment.

218
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,540
Over there.

219
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,620
Qingche.

220
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,780
Grandpa, what's wrong?

221
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,780
The bath hasn't been used
for quite some time.

222
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
Let me check the water.

223
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,020
It's fine. The water is warm.

224
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,780
It's fine. Grandpa.

225
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,450
Let me check if it's warm enough.
Come on.

226
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,130
No need to check.

227
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,020
What's wrong?

228
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,740
You don't let me see you
take a bath now? Are you shy?

229
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,300
I watched you grow up.
What haven't I seen?

230
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,020
You're really...

231
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,980
No.

232
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,140
There needs to be

233
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,860
some distance even between men.

234
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,100
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,660
You're getting married soon.

236
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,460
Alright, I won't see it.

237
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,890
Let me know if the water isn't okay.

238
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,820
Okay.

239
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,810
Please get out, Grandpa.

240
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,690
The floor's slippery.

241
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,020
I know that, Grandpa.

242
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,980
Can you get out, please?

243
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,060
I need to change my pants.

244
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,340
Okay.

245
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
Get out now.

246
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,940
I'm fine.

247
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,620
Fine, that's it. Be careful.

248
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,760
What brings you here?

249
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,220
Why else do you think?

250
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,860
It's freezing in my room.
The AC is broken.

251
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,870
You didn't answer my call,

252
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,880
so I came looking for you.

253
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,300
Then how about

254
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,180
you sleep in my room?

255
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Are you done?

256
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,220
I'm coming.

257
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,100
So this is
what your childhood room looks like.

258
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,740
Hadn't come back in ages.

259
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,580
All these things are from my childhood.

260
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,580
You were quite studious.

261
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,400
Haven't read these for years.

262
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,300
Why so many cars?

263
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,440
I've loved driving since I was young.

264
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,020
That's how I won this trophy.

265
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,060
No, I got this in a math competition.

266
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,460
Looks like you were a good student.

267
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,100
Merit Student.

268
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,540
Good Boy.

269
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,980
Outstanding Leader.

270
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,300
Great Progress.

271
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,460
Wow, is that you as a kid?
You were so cute.

272
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,300
Is this an album?

273
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,580
This album should have pictures of me
when I was a kid.

274
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
So you were a chubby kid?

275
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
That's not me.

276
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,300
Not you? Then who is it?

277
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,900
My cousin.

278
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,660
Well, that's a coincidence.

279
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,660
You really look like your cousin.

280
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,300
These are all photos of him.

281
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,620
But I noticed

282
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,700
that you didn't smile much as a kid.

283
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,900
Back then, I thought it was cool

284
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,780
to not speak or smile.

285
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,680
A nonconformist, huh?

286
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,940
Look.

287
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,420
These fish.

288
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,380
You know what?

289
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,520
My grandpa
takes great care of these fish.

290
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,340
Especially that white one.

291
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,820
Thank goodness.

292
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,180
The piggy I raised hard

293
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,000
has finally gotten his cabbage.
[*Has finally gotten a girlfriend]

294
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,820
Old Mr. Su, you want to eat cabbage?

295
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,820
Who wants to eat cabbage?

296
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,060
What filling is this?

297
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,660
Radish.

298
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,890
Then I'll have cabbage-stuffed ones
tomorrow.

299
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,180
Morning, Colonel.

300
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,780
Morning.

301
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,820
How was last night? Did you sleep well?

302
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,060
Yeah, I did.

303
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,300
The air here feels much better

304
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,460
than in the city.

305
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,340
I feel so refreshed.

306
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,300
Come on, let's eat.

307
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,820
Grandpa.

308
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,860
Don't eat such oily food in the morning.

309
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,900
Remember your hypertension?

310
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,860
Experts say

311
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,380
elderly people should eat more meat.

312
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,340
You young people
need to lose weight, right?

313
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,120
You guys eat vegetarian food.
I'll eat meat.

314
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,100
I can't eat anymore.

315
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,100
By the way,

316
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,420
in a few days,

317
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,300
it'll be your parents' deathday.

318
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,260
Could you buy some flowers

319
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,460
and seasonal fruits or snacks for that?

320
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,140
If you're busy, it's okay.

321
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,380
Just come back on that day, alright?

322
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,940
Should I go now, then?

323
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,140
I'll go with you.

324
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,940
No, you stay here.

325
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,580
I need to play chess with this girl.

326
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,620
Just go.

327
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,660
Okay, I'll go by myself.

328
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,460
Kid.

329
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,300
Qingche never told you
about his parents, did he?

330
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,260
No, he never mentioned them to me.

331
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,140
I knew he wouldn't.

332
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,780
When he was little,

333
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,900
his parents were driving him

334
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,900
to visit me in the army

335
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,740
when they had a car accident.

336
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,460
Their car rolled down the hill.

337
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,900
His parents died,

338
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,180
but he was lucky.

339
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,900
He was saved by the rescue team.

340
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,340
It was a narrow escape.

341
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
I see.

342
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,220
No wonder he joined the rescue team.

343
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,020
After that incident,

344
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,820
he became quiet and withdrawn.

345
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,420
He never talked

346
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,180
about getting bullied at school

347
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,580
when he came home.

348
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,700
Wherever he goes,

349
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,260
he keeps his troubles to himself.

350
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,940
That's just how he is now.

351
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,500
Kid.

352
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,780
He's over 30,

353
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,900
but he's just a tall,

354
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,580
clueless guy.

355
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,700
You're the first girl he's brought home.

356
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,780
Sometimes, I fear
that he lacks experience

357
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,460
and might get hurt in relationships.

358
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,820
So, when you came,

359
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,660
I asked you a few more questions.
I hope you don't mind.

360
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,260
No, not at all.

361
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,020
You have your own dreams
and aspirations.

362
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,620
You're a reasonable kid.

363
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,540
Qingche

364
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,420
is lucky to have

365
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,580
found a girl like you

366
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,260
as his first love.

367
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,540
In the future,

368
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,060
if he ever mistreats you,

369
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,420
just tell me. I'll sort him out.

370
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,740
Don't say that, Grandpa.

371
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,260
He's really good to me.

372
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,340
Since you're together now,

373
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,440
you two should get along well.

374
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,820
You two aren't young anymore.

375
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
If you can decide on this,

376
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,420
then do it soon.

377
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,780
My wish will be fulfilled.

378
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
His parents would be happy, too.

379
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
I understand, Grandpa.

380
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,020
Xiaoli, I bought breakfast.

381
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,440
Be careful.
You might hit your head and get hurt.

382
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,900
It's your fault.

383
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,630
Where are my glasses?

384
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,620
I accidentally stepped on them.

385
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,540
They're broken.

386
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,180
I can't see anything beyond five meters.

387
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,500
It's okay. I'll buy you a new pair.

388
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,100
Let's go and get you a new one.

389
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,500
Come on.

390
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,900
Hold on.

391
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,500
This way.

392
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,740
Grandpa.

393
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,700
Qingyin, why did you come?

394
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,060
I brought you a gift.

395
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,640
Great, thank you.

396
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,700
I missed you, Grandpa.

397
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,900
I happen to be on a break,

398
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,220
so I come to see you.

399
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,020
Fine, at least you have the heart,

400
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,700
unlike Qingche,
who always needs reminders.

401
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,860
Right, this is Song Xingchen.

402
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,340
You two know each other?

403
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,900
Of course.

404
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,410
Not only do we know each other,

405
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,660
we've even worked together.

406
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,180
Right, Xingchen?

407
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,220
Yes, Grandpa.

408
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,220
I remember now.

409
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,580
Was it

410
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,940
the electric fan shooting scene?

411
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,700
Yes.

412
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,020
After that shoot,
I even caught a cold, Grandpa.

413
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,300
So, you need to exercise more.

414
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,620
You're too thin,

415
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,860
which weakens your immunity.

416
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,980
That's why you caught a cold.

417
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,580
Have you eaten?

418
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,660
Not yet.

419
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,740
Let's eat together.

420
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,300
Come on, grab the chopsticks.

421
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,780
I didn't expect you to return

422
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,180
with Qingche this time, Xingchen.

423
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:34,980
Yeah.

424
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,260
When Grandpa called Qingche,

425
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,100
I happened to be in Sucheng with him,

426
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,420
conducting medical training.

427
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,590
Quite a coincidence, right?

428
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,220
Yes.

429
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,700
Qingche often forgets everything
whenever he gets busy.

430
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,980
Thank you for supporting him all along.

431
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,460
Grandpa, please don't say that.

432
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
You're being too formal.

433
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,780
Are you two together now?

434
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,230
Is this considered meeting his elder?

435
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,540
You can interpret it that way.

436
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,700
Did you completely cut ties
with your ex-boyfriend, the professor?

437
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,520
I'm with Qingche now.

438
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,310
What does it have to do
with my ex-boyfriend?

439
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,750
But you're still in contact with him.

440
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,160
Isn't that keeping some connections?

441
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,380
Our contact is purely related

442
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,780
to work and friendship.

443
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,550
I believe it's more distant compared

444
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,860
to your relationship with Qingche.

445
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,920
I sense you won't
treat Qingche well in the future.

446
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,940
If I don't treat him well,

447
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,300
why should I be in a relationship?

448
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,930
Your intuition is way off.

449
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,860
Who will cook, you or Qingche?

450
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,300
I don't cook.

451
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,810
Who handles the chores?

452
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,070
We'll each take care of our own.

453
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,780
Men work outside,
and women do the chores.

454
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,110
Qingche has a lot on his plate.

455
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,140
You have more free time.

456
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,100
Why don't you do it?

457
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,500
Work is equally tiring,

458
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,140
and I'm not dependent on a man.

459
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,300
Why should it all fall on me?

460
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,780
Why you.

461
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,060
Hold on.

462
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,100
Why so many questions?

463
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,900
You acted like Qingche's parents.

464
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,140
Grandpa.

465
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,260
I'm just helping
to keep an eye out for Qingche.

466
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,140
You don't need to.

467
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,220
It's their affair,

468
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,140
and she's a guest.

469
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,140
Show some respect, understand?

470
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,820
Let's eat.

471
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,100
Grandpa, eat more.

472
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,060
No talking during the meal.

473
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,540
Got it.

474
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
It's not healthy
and could lead to choking.

475
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,060
Did you hear me?
You could get choked. Eat up.

476
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,060
Oh, my.

477
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,180
Things here must be expensive, right?

478
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,540
Do you think
I can't afford this as a captain?

479
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,660
This way. Let's go.

480
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,880
What are you doing?

481
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,900
You can't distinguish
beyond five meters.

482
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,410
I'm worried you'll bump into something.

483
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,140
Alright then, guide dog.

484
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,500
Why are your words
as sharp as your bestie's?

485
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,280
Depends on who I'm talking to.

486
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,300
Is that so?

487
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,260
I'll leave, then.

488
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,380
Depends?

489
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,620
Can't you at least have some conscience?

490
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,860
I've noticed something.

491
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,580
You look better without glasses.

492
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,220
I'm blind without them.

493
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,140
Just trust me.

494
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,970
It's a whole different vibe.

495
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,380
Smooth talker.

496
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,180
Let's go, guide dog.

497
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:58,700
You...

498
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,300
Giddy up.

499
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,220
Let's go.

500
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,740
Hurry.

501
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,570
These look nice.

502
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,420
What do you think?

503
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,390
I think these look good.

504
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,380
I'll try them.

505
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,220
Pretty good. How much for these?

506
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,930
It's exactly 3,000 after the discount.

507
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,900
3,000?

508
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Seems a bit pricey.

509
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,180
It's okay. Just buy it.

510
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,940
I'll let you spend the money, then.

511
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,220
Stop pretending.

512
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,500
Last time, you acted for three minutes

513
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,620
and took my 5,000 yuan.
Where did all that effort go?

514
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,680
I've been nice to you,

515
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,600
and now you're getting ahead
of yourself, right?

516
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,560
Miss, I want to see something
more expensive.

517
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,180
Sure.

518
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,890
No need.

519
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,660
This one's good.

520
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,100
But you can only collect it
after two days.

521
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,630
It's fine. Give her a pair

522
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,420
of contact lenses
with the same prescription.

523
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,430
Let her try for two days.

524
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,150
Sure thing.

525
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,700
Miss, your contact lenses.

526
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,740
Thank you.

527
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:00,940
Come.

528
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,580
Come on. Sit.

529
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,020
What's this about?

530
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,740
Actually, you have a good foundation.

531
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,580
It's a waste
of being plain-faced every day.

532
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,500
I think I'm doing pretty well like this.

533
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,060
Change your style
and spruce it up occasionally.

534
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,670
I promise it'll be eye-catching for you.

535
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,900
Miss.

536
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,540
Excuse me.

537
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,340
Hello.

538
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,700
What can I do for you?

539
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,420
I think she needs a shade 1 foundation,

540
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,900
an orange-brown eyeshadow,

541
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,420
and a smoky rose lipstick.

542
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,020
Alright, based on your needs,

543
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,980
I'll help you

544
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,460
create a makeup look that suits her.

545
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,380
Sure.

546
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,700
You're choosing for me?

547
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,860
I'm worried
I'll be shocked by your choices.

548
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,860
Just trust me.

549
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,220
Let's begin.

550
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,420
Gorgeous.

551
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,900
Sir.

552
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,180
This outfit
suits your girlfriend so well.

553
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,140
No, we're just friends.

554
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,100
You really look good.

555
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,660
Come, this way.

556
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,100
Look for yourself.

557
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,060
Look.

558
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,680
I'd be proud
if you showed up at my workplace

559
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,700
dressed like that.

560
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,700
Was I that unkempt before?

561
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,780
Not exactly.

562
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,250
Just too much like a high schooler.

563
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,140
Look at you now.
You're much more feminine.

564
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,900
This lipstick shade is also great.

565
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,020
Let's buy another one later.

566
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,180
No need. One is enough.

567
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,060
One matte, one moisturizing.

568
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,620
You can use it
for both natural and made-up looks.

569
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,980
You know nothing, do you?

570
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,100
And you're the expert?

571
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,100
Absolutely.

572
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,860
Plus, look at this makeup.

573
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,540
The foundation, eyeshadow, blush,

574
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
and contour are all well done.

575
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,410
Let's get another set.

576
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,780
No need, really. I don't need that much.

577
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,940
I rarely dress up.

578
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,780
No, you should dress up more.

579
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,180
Embrace your femininity.

580
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,260
You're always in sportswear.

581
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,460
No one can tell your gender from behind.

582
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,740
Who says women have to know lipstick?

583
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,020
Besides,

584
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,340
whether I dress up is my business.

585
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,140
Whether I look feminine
isn't your concern.

586
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,100
I'm just trying to be helpful.

587
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,580
Excuse me, how much is this?

588
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,540
Xiaoli.

589
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,140
You're actually upset.
I was just joking.

590
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,780
Not funny at all, okay?

591
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,980
Are you returning to the store today?

592
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,060
No.

593
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,500
I can handle things with my phone.

594
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,480
You don't need to escort me back.

595
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
No.

596
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
What I mean was

597
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,060
you look so good today.

598
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,180
Why not hang out with me?

599
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,900
Come with me.

600
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,700
Is the master of surprises
planning something during daylight?

601
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,980
No.

602
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,860
It's Weiling's first anniversary
at work.

603
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,630
She's treating us all
to hot pot at the base.

604
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,370
Come along with me.

605
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,580
You're telling me

606
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,740
this important thing now?

607
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,660
I can't go empty-handed.

608
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,780
I'm done eating.

609
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,740
How about you? Are you all full?

610
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,850
I'm filled up, Grandpa.

611
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,340
Great.

612
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,220
Are you all done eating?

613
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,900
Grandpa, I finished shopping.

614
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,340
Qingyin, why are you here?

615
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,460
To see Grandpa, of course.

616
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,300
Qingche, come with me for a walk.

617
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,420
Sure.

618
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,940
Yes, go. Have a stroll.

619
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,100
The environment here is nice.

620
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,310
Grandpa, we'll head out first.

621
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,260
Okay.

622
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,820
I'd like a stroll as well.

623
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,540
Where are you going?

624
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,420
Don't you stroll around here every day?

625
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,100
Let's go. Come and have tea with me.

626
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,340
Grandpa.

627
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Let's have tea.
We don't want to be with them.

628
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,940
Come and keep me company.

629
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,940
Come.

630
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,740
Sit here, kid.

631
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Come on. Try this tea.

632
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,340
This is a pre-Qingming tea
my ex-comrade gave me.

633
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,900
Grandpa, you're doing this on purpose,
aren't you?

634
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,980
You're trying to distract me,
so Qingche can be with Song Xingchen.

635
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,060
Smart kid.

636
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,020
Come. Come over here.

637
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,380
Look at my calligraphy.

638
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,220
What do you think?

639
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,500
Let go. Give up.

640
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,900
They aren't good.

641
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,660
Why aren't they good?

642
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,500
Why should we let go and give up?

643
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,540
One should bravely move forward in life.

644
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,340
That's the principle you taught me
when I was a child.

645
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,300
If it were up to me,

646
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,220
they should be "pursuit"
and "perseverance."

647
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,380
It's because life has always been
about pursuit and perseverance

648
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,980
that occasionally

649
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,180
letting go and giving up
seems more precious.

650
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,900
You're using sophistry.
I can't win against you.

651
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,620
Kid, tell me honestly,

652
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,620
how have I treated you?

653
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,060
You've always
treated me like a granddaughter.

654
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,340
You and Qingche...

655
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,820
I've watched you both grow up.

656
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,580
When you were little,

657
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,780
you liked to play with Qingche.

658
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,900
Now that you're an adult,
you still want to be with Qingche.

659
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,940
I know everything.

660
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,060
You're the only one
who's on my side, Grandpa.

661
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,100
But have you noticed?

662
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,620
Ever since Qingche met Song Xingchen,

663
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,660
it's like he's
become a different person.

664
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,580
He talks more and is more confident.

665
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,700
The way he treats Song Xingchen, you,

666
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,860
and the others

667
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,820
seem very different.
Do you get what I mean?

668
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,950
That's because Qingche
is infatuated with her.

669
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,580
Song Xingchen is so self-centered.

670
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,820
Qingche won't be happy
with her, Grandpa.

671
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,340
No, you're wrong.

672
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,340
Song Xingchen
is independent and self-reliant.

673
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,180
Qingche is self-reliant and independent.

674
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,380
The two of them spark off each other.

675
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,420
So,

676
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,020
I think Qingche won't have anyone else

677
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,060
in his life except Song Xingchen.

678
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,180
I don't understand.

679
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,100
What's so special about Song Xingchen?

680
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,420
Even you say that about her.

681
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,380
I don't believe

682
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,700
that Qingche has no feelings for me.

683
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,340
As his younger sister,
he will still be good to you.

684
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,420
Kid.

685
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,700
I've lived for many years.

686
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,660
I see everything clearly

687
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,680
and understand perfectly.

688
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,860
I'm breaking this news to you today

689
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,380
because I care about you.

690
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,540
I'm afraid the deeper you get involved,
the more pain you'll be in.

691
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,020
Do you understand?

692
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,340
She's so stubborn.

693
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,500
Buy some flowers. They look so nice.

694
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,660
No, thanks, madam.

695
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,820
The air is so fresh here.

696
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,940
The architecture
is also quaint and charming.

697
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,060
I lived here all my life as a child

698
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,580
before moving to Haicheng.

699
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,670
Surprisingly, I miss this place.

700
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,060
What would you like?

701
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,100
One tofu pudding.

702
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,100
No sugar.

703
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,700
Also, don't add any of these.

704
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,570
Leave them out.

705
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,240
Take a seat and wait a moment.

706
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,500
I used to live

707
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,460
in an old house with my parents.

708
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,140
There were many stalls like this nearby.

709
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,710
I loved eating these when I was a kid.

710
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,060
So, you're also from a small town.

711
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,220
Sir, is it ready?

712
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,460
Thank you.

713
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,820
Enjoy.

714
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,500
Let me show you how I eat it.

715
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,380
Less of this.

716
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,100
Okay.

717
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,220
More of this.

718
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:35,820
Soy sauce.

719
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,420
Most importantly, chili.
You like spicy food.

720
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,060
How is it?

721
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,940
Not bad.

722
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,700
No wonder you
were a chubby kid back then.

723
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,780
Can you stop bringing up that point?

724
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,940
You know

725
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,890
who taught me this?
An elementary school classmate.

726
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,420
My parents

727
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,020
loved eating this tofu pudding

728
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,580
and always brought me to eat it.

729
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,660
But my way of eating
was different from theirs.

730
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,570
I ate it like this.

731
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,890
They used to nag at me.

732
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,820
Afraid that I would have diarrhea.

733
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,860
But later,

734
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,620
my dad also tried it this way

735
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,140
and stopped nagging at me.

736
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,780
He fell in love with this, too.

737
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,540
Then, it became my mom

738
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,260
nagging at me along with my dad.

739
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,180
Your grandpa told me

740
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,900
about your parents.

741
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,660
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

742
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,900
I thought...

743
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,640
it's all in the past.

744
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,100
I understand.

745
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,860
What happened in the past

746
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,940
is saddening.

747
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,080
Although your parents
aren't around anymore,

748
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,020
you still have a grandfather
who loves you

749
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,540
and a group of friends like Lu Qun.

750
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,220
Most importantly,

751
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,100
now you have me.

752
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,620
Su Qingche.

753
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,340
I'm glad to be the one you love.

754
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,820
You make me feel secure.

755
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,820
Didn't I make it a salty dish?

756
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,060
Why did you
become so sweet after eating it?

757
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,420
Trying to get more out of this?

758
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,180
Thank you, Xingchen.

759
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,940
One more thing.

760
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,700
I want to make it clear to you.

761
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,820
No matter what happens in the future,

762
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,180
whether it's good or bad,
you have to tell me.

763
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,020
Sharing only joy and not sorrows

764
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,580
is a form of selfishness.

765
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,140
Your grandpa may be fine with it,
but I won't spoil you.

766
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,500
Yes, madam.

767
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,820
(He Ji)
Eat up. It'll get cold soon.

768
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,380
(He Ji)
Once we finish,

769
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,520
let's go and buy some fish.

770
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,630
Grandpa loves to eat fish,

771
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,100
and you can enjoy

772
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,920
Ms. Zhang's cooking.

773
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,660
Sure.

774
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,800
I bought two fresh fish.

775
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,200
Use them to make lunch for Grandpa.

776
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,060
Old Mr. Su has been longing for fish

777
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,940
but couldn't get any.

778
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,620
Save one for next time.

779
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,580
Once he sees it on the dining table,

780
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,540
he won't stop eating.

781
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,140
I understand.

782
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,180
Let's go.

783
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,260
Are you leaving again?

784
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,660
We'll be back before lunch.

785
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,700
Be safe.

786
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,420
Ms. Zhang, where are they going?

787
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,620
I don't know.
They left acting mysteriously.

788
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,980
Qingyin, where are you going?

789
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,820
I'm heading home.

790
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,220
(Baile Alley 35)

791
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,140
Where are we going?

792
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,220
Should we tell Grandpa?

793
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,420
No need. We can make it back for lunch.

794
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,020
What's going on? So mysterious.

795
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,830
You'll know once we get there.
