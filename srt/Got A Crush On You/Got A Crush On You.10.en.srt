=Got A Crush On You=
(Adapted from Bei Qing's novel "Got A Crush On You")

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,740
=Episode 10=

24
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,500
Why are you here?

25
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,980
Aunt Xingchen.

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,340
You need my help?

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,460
My elective course project proposal

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,660
was rejected by Tang.

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,167
He said my content is empty

30
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,800
and not backed
by real-life case studies.

31
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:04,487
So?

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,060
So I want you to show me

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,460
the sales data of your store

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,741
and discuss the difficulties
you've encountered in your operation.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,340
You want to use my store
as a case study.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,432
So he won't
have anything to say then, right?

37
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,980
Let me tell you.

38
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,923
If the problem is with your content,

39
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,705
using anyone as a shield won't work.

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,580
I promise.

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,820
This time I will
incorporate real-life case studies

42
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:24,792
and complete the paper.

43
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:25,980
Just looking at the data,

44
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,980
it's like talking on paper.

45
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,780
You'll know when you try it.

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Understand?

47
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,500
But you can't expect me
to find an online store

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,820
and go undercover, right?

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,490
It doesn't have to be that complicated.

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,780
These samples

51
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,780
need to be inventoried and promoted.

52
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,820
Your store's practical training
starts here.

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,620
We start work at 9:00 a.m.

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,660
Get everything done
before work tomorrow.

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,500
Alright?

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,140
This...

57
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,660
Come on.

58
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,020
I'll take this.

59
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,420
Bring this and this inside.

60
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,940
Hurry up. What are you staring at?

61
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,060
Heartless bully.

62
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,380
Hi, I'm Tang Ruize.

63
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,220
Xingchen's friend from university.

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,900
Ex-boyfriend.

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,580
(Mr. Tang.)

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,540
What's your profession?

67
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,340
I teach at university.

68
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,300
Did you and Xingchen
know each other in university?

69
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,996
How long were you together?

70
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:31,580
Two years.

71
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,500
I attended Professor Tang's class

72
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,980
and gained a lot.

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,220
(Stardust Rogue)

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,540
Let's go. I'm tired.

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,260
Miss.

76
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,660
You are...

77
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,740
Why did you come so late?

78
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,860
You said you have a store around here.

79
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,180
I came to ask for your help.

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:02,980
I see.

81
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,060
Give it to me.

82
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,700
Baby.

83
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,460
Miss.

84
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,156
How did you know what I wanted to do?

85
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,620
That's a woman's intuition.

86
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,140
Later,

87
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,500
when you need to take it back,

88
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,872
feel free to come to me anytime.

89
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,940
Thank you, miss. Goodbye.

90
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,260
This is the puppy you rescued last time?

91
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,100
So adorable.

92
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,020
(Stardust Rogue)

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,880
(Stardust Rogue)

94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,780
Miss, what are you doing?

95
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,940
I just came to look around.

96
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,140
It's already 9:00 a.m.,

97
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,065
and it's not open yet.

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,420
How do you do business?

99
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,905
What do you need so early
in the morning?

100
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,340
That urgent?

101
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,540
(Song Xingchen is doing this business?)

102
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,060
Miss.

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,260
We're restocking.

104
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,780
Very busy.

105
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,880
How about this?

106
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,660
If you need anything,

107
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,780
just order online.

108
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,476
It'll be delivered as soon as possible.

109
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,287
Since you're open,
why can't I look around?

110
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,178
Alright, feel free to look around.

111
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,620
Is this all you sell in your store?

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,380
You're not here to buy, are you?

113
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,300
I just came to take a look.

114
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,140
By the way,

115
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,820
I'm Song Xingchen's junior.

116
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,020
I admire her a lot.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,540
(Well done, Aunt Xingchen.)

118
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,460
(She even has a fan.)

119
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,740
You've found the right person.

120
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,740
In this world,

121
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,778
no one understands Ms. Song
better than me.

122
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,780
Okay.

123
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,140
I ask, and you answer.

124
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,580
One question, one banknote.

125
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,100
Are you treating me like a barmaid?

126
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,636
If you want me to answer, sure.

127
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,620
Did you see these?

128
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,860
One box, one question.

129
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,220
I guarantee it'll be the same
as online prices.

130
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,100
Deal. I'll take all of them.

131
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,660
Okay.

132
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,421
There are about seven boxes here.

133
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,220
Seven questions.

134
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,380
Do you guarantee
that you'll tell the truth?

135
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,740
Rest assured.

136
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,660
I'm a person of integrity.

137
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,540
You won't hold anything back?

138
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,140
Are young people always so verbose?

139
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,680
You still have five questions.

140
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,780
Those questions count too?

141
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,220
Yes. This counts too.

142
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,632
You have four left.

143
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,140
You...

144
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,900
Okay.

145
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,100
What's the relationship
between Song Xingchen and Su Qingche?

146
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,580
You did some background checks.

147
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,220
In my opinion,

148
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,020
Su Qingche will
become Song Xingchen's boyfriend.

149
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,420
So you mean

150
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,460
their relationship
is still uncertain now?

151
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,580
Currently, no.

152
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,980
But

153
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,420
there's potential.

154
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,020
Then, that Professor Tang...

155
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,660
Tang Ruize.

156
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,100
Right.

157
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,300
Why did they break up?

158
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,340
Back then,
Professor Tang went abroad to study.

159
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,260
Do they have a chance to reconcile?

160
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,450
They haven't seen each other
for too long.

161
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:05,940
According to Song Xingchen,

162
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,380
the past is in the past.

163
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,740
But with emotions,

164
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,980
no one can say for sure.

165
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,780
So, does that mean
they have a chance to reconcile?

166
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,260
Why do you
only listen to half of what I say?

167
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,260
Let me ask you.

168
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,900
Does Song Xingchen have to be

169
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,980
with Su Qingche?

170
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,260
I don't know about that.

171
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,460
That's another question.

172
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,260
Alright, I've answered your questions.

173
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,780
It was a pleasant collaboration.

174
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,540
Looking forward to your next visit.

175
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,700
6,550 yuan in total.

176
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,500
Scan it.

177
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,760
(Haicheng University)

178
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,180
Professor.

179
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,460
Professor.

180
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,220
Can you please sign this for me?

181
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,740
Sure.

182
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,340
(Reviewer: Grade:)

183
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,780
Professor.

184
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,500
You should sign on the reviewer section.

185
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,660
That's the grade section.

186
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,260
(Reviewer: Grade:)

187
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,032
What's wrong with you?

188
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:18,500

You're quite quick.

198
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,260
Don't bother.

199
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,781

200

What do you mean?

201
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,380
I've already

202
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,020
sold the products.

203

204
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,460

205
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,807
I also bought some breakfast.

206
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,720
I'll transfer the rest
of the money to you.

207
00:09:58,763 --> 00:09:59,420

208
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,980
How did you manage to do that?

209
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,020
That's considered a trade secret.

210
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,820

211

How did he do it?

217
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,712

at least take half a month to sell.

222

243
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,460

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,589
Sorry about that.

379
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,440
I'll handle it now.

380
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,181
Fix it, quick.

381
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,580
Yes.

382
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh my goodness.

383
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
What do I do now?

384
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,860
(Life is "great". Any plumbers here?)

385
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
(Plumber here. Any job for me, pretty?)

386
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,640
(Room 636, 6th Floor, Boyu Apartment,
35 Jinquan Road.)

387
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,620
Look.

388
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,060
The pipe is broken.

389
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,380
When did you become so kind?

390
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Dropping by so late at night.

391
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,140
Your beauty summoned me.

392
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,440
Lost isn't the earring,
but my grace of return.

393
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,660
Meeting you again, a sweet concern.

394
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,700
So, it was you.
Song Xingchen's love advisor.

395
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,260
It was you who made Su Qingche

396
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,580
so corny.

397
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,940
Your enthusiasm is suspicious.

398
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,820
Are you trying to win my trust?

399
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,460
I beg you.

400
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,940
Stop giving your bestie
all sorts of bad suggestions

401
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,820
that would cause Qingche to overthink.

402
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,900
They aren't complaining,

403
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,340
so why are you anxious for them?

404
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,780
Can you handle it or not?

405
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,540
If you can't,

406
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,660
I'll get a plumber to come over.

407
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,740
Of course I can.

408
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,660
Tell you what.

409
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,660
Everyone in our rescue team is talented.

410
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,060
Besides, I'm the deputy captain.

411
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,220
How could I not be able
to fix a water pipe?

412
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,620
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,460
This...

414
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,260
Alright.

415
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,220
Stop fixing it.

416
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,540
Get up.

417
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,980
I'm so sorry.

418
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,340
My mistake.

419
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,140
My mistake.

420
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,020
My mistake.

421
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,380
Come on. Get up.

422
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,860
Lu Qun!

423
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,300
How could I believe you
could fix the water pipe?

424
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,500
It's my mistake.

425
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,780
I'll get someone to fix it properly.

426
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,860
(Galaxy Mansion, Block C)

427
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,980
Here. Have some warm water.

428
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,363
Drink something warm to warm up.

429
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,740
It's hot.

430
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,620
After a whole day's work

431
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,500
and finally coming home,

432
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,500
I thought I could rest well,

433
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,340
but then the water pipe broke.

434
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,420
I wanted to find someone to fix it,

435
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,980
but that someone worsened it.

436
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,421
It's my fault for wanting to show off.

437
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,300
But I found someone to fix it for you.

438
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,780
By the way,

439
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,858
what have you been up to lately?

440
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,840
Why are you so busy?

441
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,900
We've been
thinking of becoming distributors,

442
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,740
but the product information we found

443
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
is all in Japanese.

444
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,340
We don't understand Japanese,

445
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,020
so Xingchen and I

446
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,650
translated it character by character.

447
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,900
I know a translator.

448
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,705
I can introduce you.

449
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:23,660
He can start tomorrow.

450
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,850
Still trying to trick me?

451
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,420
How could I?

452
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,940
How could I trick you?

453
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,800
Let me tell you,

454
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,740
this is a one-time offer.

455
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,420
Are you sick?

456
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,825
Do you have any medicine at home?

457
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,700
At home...

458
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,420
I think I ran out.

459
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,883
If that's the case...

460
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,901
Go lie down in bed.

461
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:51,900
I have an idea. Come on.

462
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,460
Come on.

463
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,500
Let's go.

464
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,780
Lie down.

465
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,780
I'll be there in a sec.

466
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,270
(The best ways to cure the cold)

467
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,300
Babe, take a look.

468
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,100
Can you understand it now?

469
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,900
Here it comes.

470
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,060
Quick. Drink it while it's hot.

471
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,900
You'll feel better.

472
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,480
You don't need to take care of me.

473
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:33,740
I can manage on my own.

474
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,980
No, that won't do.

475
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,500
The one who pollutes, cleans up.

476
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,054
Consider this compensation
for my unreliable actions.

477
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,860
Brown sugar water?

478
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,180
(I'm not on my period.)

479
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,700
(Why should I drink this?)

480
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,300
I made it myself.

481
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,140
Have a taste.

482
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,220
I even scalded myself while making it.

483
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,540
Are you okay?

484
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,940
It does hurts a bit.

485
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,220
How about you help me soothe it?

486
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,460
Xiaoli.

487
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,700
Drink it while it's warm.

488
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,460
Here.

489
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,140
What's the matter?

490
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,940
Is there ginger in this?

491
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,260
Yes.

492
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,500
Brown sugar and ginger dispels colds.

493
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,854
I read it on the internet.

494
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,778
It couldn't be wrong.

495
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,740
But you
have to control the amount you put.

496
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,060
Is there too much?

497
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,980
It's fine.

498
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,872
Then don't drink this.

499
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,992
I'll get you some water.

500
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,540
Here.

501
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,340
Rinse your mouth.

502
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,500
What now?

503
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,020
I was about to ask you.

504
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,540
Why is it salty?

505
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,763
A lightly salted water is good
for people with fever and dehydration.

506
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:13,820
Lightly salted water?

507
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,654
Taste it yourself.
Is this lightly salted?

508
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,900
It seems like I've put too much.

509
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,460
It's fine. I'll get you a new one.

510
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,580
No, thank you.

511
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,220
It was originally a slight cold

512
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,020
and light fever.

513
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,260
But after your care,

514
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,620
I think I'm at least
suffering from food poisoning.

515
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,100
I beg you.

516
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
Please leave, okay?

517
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,100
Leave.

518
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,454
You're ill because of me,
so let me take care of you.

519
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,620
I might be better

520
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,220
without your care.

521
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,020
But...

522
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,020
Remember to take your medicine.

523
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,020
I know. Please leave.

524
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,940
They're together all day.

525
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,980
But why is Su Qingche

526
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,540
like a lovable and cool Border Collie

527
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,940
while he's like a Husky?

528
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,180
(Shiya Takeout:
Faster medicine delivery)

529
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
(Cold and fever pellets)

530
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,460
(Spelin capsules)

531
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,700
Actually,

532
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,500
besides being dumb,

533
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,020
he seems to be a nice guy.

534
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,058
Han Xiaoli, what are you thinking?

535
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,740
(Shiya Takeout:
Faster medicine delivery)

536
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,940
(Han Xiaoli: Severe cold and fever.)

537
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
(The water pipe broke last night.)

538
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,625
(I think I'm done for today.)

539
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,220
(Song Xingchen:
Are you alright being alone?)

540
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,567
(Han Xiaoli: With Lu Qun as my laborer,
there's no need to worry.)

541
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,260
(But you're on your own.
I feel bad about it.)

542
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,860
(Stay at home today
and don't go to the store.)

543
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,956
(In any case, we've almost
emptied out our inventory,)

544
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,854
(and there's nothing to do there.)

545
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,020
(Song Xingchen:
That's great. It saves me a trip.)

546
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,580
Lu Qun?

547
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,290
(Han Xiaoli: Great.)

548
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,025
(By the way,)

549
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,180
(there's a free translator)

550
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,687
(coming to your house this afternoon.)

551
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:18,420
(It's Su Qingche.)

552
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,700
(Tang Ruize)

553
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,020
Hello?

554
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,380
Hey, Xingchen.

555
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,940
I would like to talk to you

556
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,060
about the store.

557
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,900
Sure.

558
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,989
I'll see you later.

559
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,060
See you later.

560
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
I got this for you.

561
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,940
The email you sent last time,

562
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,689
I have yet to have a chance
to dive into it.

563
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,730
Last time, it was about
the store's transformation,

564
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,541
and now we're moving on to the branding.

565
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,680
(Case study)

566
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:58,140
Guess what?

567
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,269
It's exactly what I've been looking for.

568
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,927
Any plans for the next steps?

569
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,460
We plan

570
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,140
to rep a Japanese brand

571
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,687
as our first move
towards attracting new clientele.

572
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,690
A Japanese brand?

573
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,180
That means

574
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,738
you'll need a Japanese translator.

575
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:16,260
Yeah.

576
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,580
We just got the materials

577
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,940
and are scratching our heads.

578
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,340
No problem.

579
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,820
Send them to me.

580
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,316
I'll get someone from translation
to help with it.

581
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:25,825
It's fine.

582
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,980
Xiaoli said

583
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,603
she found a translator for me,

584
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,123
and he'll come over to my place later.

585
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,100
A translator?

586
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,900
Could it be Su Qingche?

587
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,740
Yeah, it's him.

588
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,780
It's getting late.

589
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,140
I should go.

590
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,945
By the way,

591
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,940
I owe you a meal
if the deal goes through.

592
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,140
Sure.

593
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm off.

594
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,380
Drive safe.

595
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,716
How long have you been waiting?

596
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,229
No worries. I just got here, too.

597
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,980
Sorry about that.

598
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,272
I had to step out for a bit.

599
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:11,980
Let's go.

600
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,500
Thanks a lot today.

601
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,140
You swooped in just in time.

602
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,025
You were in such a hurry

603
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,312
and mentioned it was today only.

604
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,476
Of course, I had to hurry up.

605
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:28,500
I didn't expect you

606
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,780
to be so proficient in everything.

607
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,780
Just translating this?

608
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,945
What's all this about?

609
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,341
We're planning to rebrand soon.

610
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,500
Our inventory has almost cleared out,

611
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,560
and we have sold out
all the online stock.

612
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:41,740
I need to speed things up

613
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,020
and lock in with the target brand ASAP.

614
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,669
Why didn't you contact me last night

615
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:47,905
if you're in such a hurry?

616
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,540
I didn't want to bother you.

617
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,260
By the way,

618
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,160
Lu Qun has been hanging out
with Han Xiaoli a lot,

619
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,300
even going to her place.

620
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,540
Does he have an agenda?

621
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,900
I don't know.

622
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,300
I told him

623
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,300
not to.

624
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,494
Let's get to work.

625
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,940
You translate, and I'll record.

626
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,316
Are you sure you want me to read it?

627
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,020
Is the language too difficult?

628
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,894
How about
using translation software instead?

629
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:23,498
No need.

630
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:24,260
I'll read it.

631
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,500
This product

632
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,100
provides gentle moisturization

633
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,420
and nourishment

634
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,180
to the skin

635
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,140
while also leaving hair silky smooth.

636
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,860
Go on.

637
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,420
Song Xingchen.

638
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,580
Didn't you say

639
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,020
that a girl desires
to be unequivocally possessed?

640
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,380
Can you be mine?

641
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,260
When did you get a dog?

642
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,540
It's probably hungry.

643
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,660
It's you.

644
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,180
Are you currying favor with a dog?

645
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,020
No.

646
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,380
Isn't it the dog we saved together?

647
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,141
We saved it together?

648
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,220
You're that guy.

649
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,620
Didn't you know?

650
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,580
Why did you not tell me?

651
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,300
I thought you knew.

652
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,840
You didn't ask either.

653
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,500
When did you recognize me?

654
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,820
On the blind date.

655
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,340
To be honest,

656
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,500
my purpose was clear.

657
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,380
I intended to scare you off.

658
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,660
I felt it.

659
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,220
I was wondering

660
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,500
why you were

661
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,060
so different

662
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,900
from the person I saw.

663
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,447
Your words and actions
were completely different.

664
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,500
So, that day was our first meeting.

665
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,300
Compared to back then,

666
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,660
what's the difference

667
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,740
between me

668
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,820
to you?

669
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,260
The present you

670
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,620
like me.

671
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,020
Little did you know,

672
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,060
I liked you

673
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,901
since our first meeting.

674
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,820
I never expected

675
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,700
to see you again during the blind date.

676
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,740
I was stunned.

677
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,500
How about now?

678
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,100
Are you disappointed?

679
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,660
I'm just a little

680
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,820
curious.

681
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,940
When you joined the rescue team,

682
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,100
I wondered

683
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,340
how a girl like you could...

684
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,980
What's wrong with a girl like me?

685
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,460
I didn't expect someone so pretty

686
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
can also be so hardworking

687
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,020
to join the rescue team.

688
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,860
Seeing your dedication

689
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,900
and willingness to help others,

690
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,620
it's hard not to be impressed.

691
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,140
You're a sweet talker

692
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,700
with your compliments.

693
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,420
How about you?

694
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,180
Do you

695
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,300
have feelings for me?

696
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,020
That night when you
had a fever at my place.

697
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,580
Did you really not hear anything?

698
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,700
Nope.

699
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,820
Mind repeating it again?

700
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,100
Sure.

701
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,940

Should we grab some snacks for the team?

713
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,620
Weiling has been craving snacks

714
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,540
since early morning.

715
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,420
You're pretty close

716
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,860
to Weiling.

717
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,483
You've spent days with her,

718
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,661
but there's no progress.

719
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,840
Can you make it happen or not?

720
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,900
I do want to.

721
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,940
I'll teach you some tricks next time.

722
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,740
Thanks.

723
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,120

724
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,020
I'll be right back.

725
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,100
Hurry up.

726
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,940
(Shuiyunge Spa)

727
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,020
Bring us a bottle of water.

728
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
(English Learning Group)

729
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,620
Qingche.

730
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,620
Qingche.

731
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,800
Did you hit the jackpot?

732
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,460
Kind of.

733
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,300
You and she...

734
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,580
Have you
confirmed your relationship with her?

735
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,740
Sort of.

736
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,920
Being together means being together.

737
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,699
Not being together
means not being together.

738
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,887
What do you mean by "sort of"?

739
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:55,600
It's just...

740
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,980
I feel like we're a couple,

741
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,620
but we haven't explicitly said it

742
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,260
between us.

743
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Doesn't that mean

744
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,980
we're in a relationship?

745
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,740
Now you,

746
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,469
what were you up to last night?

747
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,180
I heard

748
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,050
you spent the night
at Han Xiaoli's place.

749
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,821
What's the story?

750
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,700
I infiltrated the enemy's lair

751
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,660
