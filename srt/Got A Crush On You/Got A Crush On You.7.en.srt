=Episode 7=

24
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,460
Lu Qun, that playboy.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,620
What's up?

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,260
Lu Qun is single now.

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,170
Isn't it normal for him
to have his own nightlife?

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,410
Why are you bothering about it?

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,300
My main concern is for you.

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,180
Think about it.

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,380
Birds of a feather flock together.

32
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,300
If he's like that,

33
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,780
how good can his good buddy be?

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,220
I suggest you

35
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,580
assess Su Qingche closely.

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,500
Alright, Ms. Han.

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,820
Oh my.

38
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,980
Drink slower.

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,460
What's going on?

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,580
Listen up.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,500
Today, we sold over fifty sets

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,980
of our new matching pajamas.

43
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,980
That many?

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,380
Yes.

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,700
Are many people dating these days?

46
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,100
Who is that?

47
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,300
(Su Qingche: Rest early.)

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,060
This guy?

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,500
Seriously.

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,300
He doesn't know how to seize the moment.

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,350
It's making me anxious.

52
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,180
Right?

53
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,420
I've tried it myself.

54
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,620
He killed the conversation,

55
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,980
and I had no idea how to respond.

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,980
I think staying cool is the right move.

57
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,260
His performance today
was too outstanding.

58
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,660
It makes me doubt
if he's been putting on a show

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,020
about being single all along.

60
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,980
Probably not. Right?

61
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,400
(Zhou Yao)

62
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,300
Hey, what's up?

63
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,140
Lu.

64
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,420
Why did you leave?

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,820
Did you go to Nana's place?

66
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,420
No, I just escorted her home.

67
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,980
Don't worry about me. Have fun.

68
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,260
(Don't be late to the meeting tomorrow.)

69
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,260
Okay.

70
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,610
I'll bring you breakfast tomorrow.

71
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,860
Alright. Go enjoy yourself.

72
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,620
(Goodbye.)

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,460
(Song Xingchen)
(Su Qingche: Rest early.)

74
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,620
(Lu Qun)

75
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,100
(Su Qingche)

76
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,420
Hey, why are you calling so late?

77
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,060
Hurry, send me a message on WeChat.

78
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,900
My WeChat seems broken.
I can't get any messages.

79
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,700
Are you nuts?

80
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,820
How can it be broken?

81
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,700
Just send it like I said.

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm waiting for a message.

83
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,540
I've sent it.

84
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,940
(It's not broken at all.)

85
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,980
Who are you anxiously waiting

86
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,840
for on WeChat so late?

87
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,660
Song Xingchen?

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,340
Don't talk nonsense.

89
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,580
Is she taking a shower?

90
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,940
Or is she working?

91
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,110
Or is she chatting with someone else?

92
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,300
(Su Qingche: Rest early.)
(Song Xingchen: Okay.)

93
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,420
What were you doing?

94
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,580
Why did you take so long to reply?

95
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,110
Don't you know
I've been waiting for you?

96
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,580
(Did you have fun today?)

97
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,860
(Do you want to consider dating me?)

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,660
(How to reply
to a girl who replied "okay")

99
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,660
(Comment: That means she doesn't
want to talk today.)

100
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,380
(Less talk, fewer mistakes.)

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,060
(Just reply with a "goodnight".)

102
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,660
Doesn't want to talk to me?

103
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,500
Babe, my stomach hurts.

104
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,620
I'm going to the restroom.

105
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,460
Go ahead.

106
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,500
Are you okay?

107
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,620
It's fine.

108
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,460
(Over here.)

109
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,260
(Are you okay?)

110
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,670
(Song Xingchen:
Listen to escape room safety reminder.)

111
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,370
(An Ji: How did it end up like that?)
(Professor Li: What happened?)

112
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,980
(Su Qingche: Rest early.)
(Song Xingchen: Okay.)

113
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,140
Is he asleep?

114
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,020
Everyone.

115
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,540
Today we

116
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,740
have a glorious and challenging task.

117
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,540
The local neighborhood committee

118
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,140
invites some elders
to Polar Night Rescue.

119
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,540
They want us
to educate them on security.

120
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,020
They also have one more request.

121
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,380
It better not be asking us to clean up.

122
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,460
Seriously?

123
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,580
Since this is a community

124
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,420
with mostly elders,

125
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,500
it's often targeted by thieves.

126
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,520
The neighborhood committee
wants to install cameras,

127
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,060
but the residents disagree.

128
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,660
Do we need to help install cameras?

129
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,620
Let me finish.

130
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,300
So, we need

131
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,900
to educate them on security

132
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,980
and persuade families

133
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,060
that are not cooperating.

134
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,900
But I'm not good with words.

135
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,340
How do I talk to them?

136
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,140
This task isn't easy.

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,060
Right.

138
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,660
We have to use our brains
other than putting in physical effort.

139
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,860
That…

140
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,860
Therefore,

141
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,820
everyone must do their job well.

142
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,340
Dismiss.

143
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,060
Okay.

144
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,540
Why do you say I'm not using my brain?

145
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,670
Don't you know it yourself?

146
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,580
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

147
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,060
Good day, everyone.

148
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,500
Today, we're
having a security education session.

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
This is the deputy leader
of Polar Night Rescue.

150
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,500
Hello, everyone.

151
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,180
You're here to persuade us, aren't you?

152
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,500
Why not speak directly?

153
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,980
We don't want to install the cameras.

154
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,220
Are you here to force us?

155
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,900
Right.

156
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,580
No.

157
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,620
No, it's not like that.

158
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,740
Our main goal is to raise awareness

159
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,740
of common safety issues in daily life.

160
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,860

for taking the time

include theft prevention, fire safety
and fraud prevention.

to cool down,

169
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,220

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,620
When there's a fire,

173
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,660
cover your mouth and nose.
Do you understand?

175

Not a mouse.

You can't!

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,580
You can't.

190
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,600
It will strain your voice.

191
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,420
Use your brain.

192
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,780
Hold on, sir!

193
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,020
Sir!

194
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,420
If there's a fire,

195
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,220
use a wet towel.

196
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,380
Cover your nose, bend

197
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,860
and escape.

198
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,060
Got it.

199
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
You got it?

200
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,420
What do both of you usually enjoy doing?

201
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Why are you asking this?

202
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,780
Actually,

203
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,060
I've noticed

204
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,500
you're both full of energy

205
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,980
and eloquent.

206
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,780
I would like to hire you

207
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,940
as our external personnel.

208
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,380
What does that mean?

209
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,700
Our rescue team often

210
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,260
needs to educate the community

211
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,900
on security.

212
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,780
If you two could

213
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,940
lead us in this work,

214
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,220
wouldn't that be smoother?

215
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,500
Plus, it could add some color

216
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,620
to your retirement life.

217
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,660
Look.

218
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,570
Here's the appointment letter
I've prepared.

219
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,540
Take a look.

220
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,380
(Letter of appointment)

221
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,140
Young man.

222
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,260
Do you have a girlfriend?

223
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,460
Not yet.

224
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,060
Let her introduce one to you.

225
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,060
It's on me.

226
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,900
That's kind of you.

227
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,100
Thank you, madam.

228
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,260
Young man.

229
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,460
We all agree.

230
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,860
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

231
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Why did you agree now?

232
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,980
What does an old man like you know?

233
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
Hurry home and tell your wife.

234
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,380
If you agree, join the blind date group.

235
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,980
What?

236
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,940
What group?

237
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,020
Blind date group.

238
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,380
(Community & Rescue Team
Blind Date Group)

239
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,420
Um...

240
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,520
After this,
I'll immediately leave the group.

241
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,580
None of my business.

242
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,260
(Haicheng University)

243
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,220
Hello?

244
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,300
Let me tell you.

245
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,060
I finally passed this course.

246
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,060
It wore me out.

247
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
You passed?

248
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,900
Of course.

249
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,950
With my streaming skills
and follower growth speed,

250
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,660
I'm fully qualified for this job.

251
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,980
Operation, on-screen presence,
and filming all in one.

252
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,100
It shows my profound understanding
of the live-streaming economy.

253
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,740
If I don't get a high score this time,

254
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,280
(I'll seriously protest to the school.)

255
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,260
Just passing is fine.

256
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,900
The previous livestream was not in vain.

257
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,220
You have to treat me.

258
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,700
Later,

259
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,620
I have to go to the new elective course.

260
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,260
The instructor is from the Ivy League.

261
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,180
(That's good.)

262
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,100
How many times
have you failed this course?

263
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,340
Good luck.

264
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,220
Hopefully, he's friendly.

265
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,620
You be busy.

266
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,420
I'm hanging up.

267
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,700
Bye.

268
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,060
We're almost late. Let's hurry.

269
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,460
Okay.

270
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,340
What's the new professor's name?

271
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,100
I don't know.
I think the surname is Tang.

272
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,700
Sorry.

273
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,940
I'll help you pick it up.

274
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,820
Her ex?

275
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,900
No, Ruize.

276
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,860
Qiancheng, long time no see.

277
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,140
I'm the professor
for New Media Economics Class.

278
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,980
Tang Ruize.

279
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,220
Hello, professor.

280
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,340
I'll go to class first.

281
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,980
Go ahead.

282
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,060
Oh my god.
I'm bullied by Song Xingchen at home,

283
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,220
and I have Ruize here.

284
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,940
What a situation. Pity myself.

285
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,580
Professor Tang.

286
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,500
I didn't expect you to know Qiancheng.

287
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,940
Who was he a student of before?

288
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,740
He was Professor Wu's student.

289
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,380
He failed this course twice already.

290
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,625
If he doesn't pass this time,

291
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,580
he won't even have the qualifications
to defend his thesis.

292
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:13,860
This course isn't difficult.

293
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,780
What's the reason?

294
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,100
He is a new media major.

295
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,220
Naturally, he has a lot to learn.

296
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,180
He also participates
in various extracurricular activities.

297
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,200
It takes much time,
and not enough credits were earned.

298
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:24,110
Liking extracurricular activities
isn't a bad thing.

299
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,570
He just needs to improve his grades.

300
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,460
Yes.

301
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,350
What's going on with you two?

302
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,220
This kid.
I don't know who he learned from.

303
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,260
Nothing much has happened yet,

304
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,480
and he confessed to Ding Weiling.

305
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,460
He got rejected.

306
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,900
You confessed to Ding Wei...

307
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,180
He likes Ding Weiling?

308
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,180
Can you care more
about our team members?

309
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,980
But right.

310
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,980
Ding Weiling seems

311
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,420
quite difficult to pursue.

312
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,100
Right? Who knows who he learned from?

313
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,140
Lin Mu.

314
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,860
Tell me

315
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,980
what happened.

316
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,980
She thinks I'm too clingy.

317
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,040
She's ignoring me now.

318
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
I just wanted to care for her more.

319
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,460
Is that what you call caring?

320
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,620
Other than work,

321
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,380
you go to her for anything,
big or small.

322
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,420
You're really...

323
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,020
Don't you have anything else to do?

324
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,300
I do.

325
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,680
I said I wanted to take her to a movie.

326
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,180
But I was afraid she wouldn't have time.

327
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,180
And then,

328
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,620
he bought a week's worth
of movie tickets.

329
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,860
Can she not feel pressured?

330
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,500
I usually only send her a few messages.

331
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,060
You've sent so many messages,

332
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,340
and she hasn't replied to you.

333
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,140
Baby, what are you doing?

334
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,860
Have you eaten?

335
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,380
Are you sleeping?

336
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,540
Why aren't you replying to me?

337
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,700
I've been waiting anxiously.

338
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,340
Are you okay?

339
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,980
What are you doing? Interrogating her?

340
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,740
Don't you think so?

341
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,940
Captain Lu.

342
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,540
You've got to help me thoroughly.

343
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,580
Give me some advice.

344
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,220
Okay.

345
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,100
Listen carefully.

346
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,420
Remember what

347
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,660
I'm about to say clearly.

348
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,100
Okay.

349
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,460
You must not be clingy to women.

350
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,340
Don't spoil them.

351
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,660
You have to treat her like a fish.

352
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,860
A fish.

353
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,500
Keep her in the fish pond.

354
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,380
In the fish pond.

355
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,540
Feed once every three days.

356
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,580
Maintain a sense of hunger.

357
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,600
Feed once every three days.

358
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,820
You can't fish her out

359
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,500
and put her in a fish tank to admire.

360
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,180
Let me give you an example.

361
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,400
A few days ago, Weiling was invited
to a friend's banquet.

362
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,660
Why didn't you let her go?

363
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,780
Let her go.

364
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,340
She can go.

365
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,940
She can go with her girlfriends,

366
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,860
but no men.

367
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,340
Do you understand the concepts

368
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,260
of freedom and space?

369
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,480
These are the two most important things
a woman needs.

370
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,380
And you?

371
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,760
You were acting like a fool.

372
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,500
Clung to her and kept saying Weiling,

373
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,420
Weiling.

374
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,180
What would her friends think
when they saw you like this?

375
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,300
Don't you think it's scary?

376
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
But I can't stand
seeing other men near her.

377
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,660
Let me tell you.
If anyone approaches her,

378
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,860
I'll squeeze the life out of him.

379
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,740
Can you keep her at home forever?

380
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,820
Your kind of love is cheap.

381
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,540
Do you understand?

382
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,060
Wait a minute. I have a question.

383
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,380
What if that man

384
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,140
is her ex-boyfriend?

385
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,980
In this situation,

386
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,620
you need to broaden your perspective.

387
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,700
Do you understand the concepts
of push and pull?

388
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,340
Push.

389
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:54,080
- Push.
- Pull.

390
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,980
Pull.

391
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,740
- Push.
- Push.

392
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,820
Pull.

393
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,060
Push.

394
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,820
Push.

395
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,140
Pull.

396
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,060
Pull.

397
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,730
Do you understand?

398
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,500
Captain Su.

399
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,660
If you encounter this situation,

400
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,300
your girlfriend goes
to see her ex-boyfriend,

401
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,580
what will you do?

402
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,500
Her ex...

403
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,340
Ex-boyfriend, right?

404
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,820
Yes.

405
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
He's already in the past.

406
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,300
What are you?

407
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,500
Present.

408
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,700
The most important thing
is to seize the present.

409
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,940
Do you think you're worse than her past?

410
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,580
Yeah.

411
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,420
Not worse, right?

412
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,180
Exactly.

413
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,740
Exactly.

414
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,740
This is called perspective.

415
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,500
This is called being a real man.

416
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,600
Did you learn something?

417
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,420
Yes.

418
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,820
Now go back and digest it well.

419
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,260
Think about it thoroughly.

420
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,300
Got it?

421
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:51,780
Wait.

422
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,540
I still don't understand the pushing

423
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,650
- and pulling.
- I'll teach you in the next class.

424
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,780
I'll teach you in the next class.

425
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,500
I...

426
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,300
Lu Qun. This is the situation now.

427
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,770
There's a mission from the Red Cross.

428
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,420
We need to transfer a batch
of chickenpox vaccines.

429
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
But now,

430
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,820
it's almost the rainy season.

431
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,010
And we have to go into the mountains.

432
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,050
The road is not easy to traverse.

433
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,380
So we need to be prepared in advance.

434
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:14,900
Okay.

435
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,740
No problem.

436
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,500
I'll make a plan for you
in the next few days.

437
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,620
What's wrong with you?

438
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,110
Are you hot?

439
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,540
Aren't you hot?

440
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,900
I'm not.

441
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,300
By the way,

442
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,420
did you mention it last night?

443
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:34,820
No.

444
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,020
What a good after-sales opportunity.

445
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,300
When you confess, she might have given birth
to her second child.

446
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,110
What second child?
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

447
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,420
What are you doing?

448
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,960
Give it to me.

449
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,980
Why?

450
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,460
You carefully examine every post
on her Moments,

451
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,780
including her replies to others
and what her best friend posts

452
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,500
in her Moments.

453
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,020
- Carefully examine each one.
- I check her Moments every day.

454
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,700
How did she get hurt?

455
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,700
(Listen to escape room safety reminder.)
It was posted last night, right?

456
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,260
Didn't see it, did you?

457
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,740
This is a bonus question.

458
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,340
Should I reply first?

459
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,580
Or should I go...

460
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,540
Enough, I got it.

461
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,860
Eat, apply, spray, and smear.

462
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,500
I've bought basically
any usable medicine.

463
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,060
Is that enough?

464
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,900
(Oh my.)

465
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,110
(If you want to poison her
with medicine, just say so.)

466
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,300
Wait.

467
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,260
(Stardust Rogue)

468
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,260
I feel like she's fine.

469
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,940
She walks quite briskly.

470
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
(Just pretend her leg is broken.)

471
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,480
Women are really troublesome.

472
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,700
Later.

473
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,580
(Stardust Rogue)

474
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,900
Xingchen.

475
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,780
What are you doing?

476
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,460
Sorry.

477
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,880
Just found out you were injured.

478
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,780
Is it this foot?

479
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,180
Why did it turn blue?

480
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,100
Spray some medicine first.

481
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,460
I still have a lot of work to do later.

482
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,460
Leave it all to me.

483
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,220
Gently.

484
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,700
(Professor Li: Come for the school
anniversary celebration.)

485
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,500
(20th Anniversary Celebration
of Haicheng University)

486
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,180
(Invitation)

487
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,500
What joyful thing happened?

488
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,000
In a few days, my alma mater
will celebrate its anniversary.

489
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,760
Many classmates and teachers
will be there.

490
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,970
It's nice to go back to school
and take a look.

491
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,300
Indeed.

492
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,620
I'll be wearing my battle robe,

493
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,340
charming a group of junior schoolmates.

494
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,220
What's wrong?
Is your throat uncomfortable?

495
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,260
No.

496
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,840
Do you have plans for the afternoon?

497
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,380
No.

498
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,100
Then let's go. Accompany me to a place.

499
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,060
Sure.

500
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,900
Let's go.

501
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,710
If you attend the school anniversary,

502
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,420
will it remind you

503
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,840
of some happy moments from the past?

504
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,980
Like your ex-boyfriend back then?

505
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,980
The times with him

506
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,060
were quite enjoyable.

507
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,820
What is he doing now?

508
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,420
He's reportedly at Burk Business School,

509
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,020
working as an economics professor.

510
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,460
Stop digging up the past.

511
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,500
Will doing that be uncomfortable for me

512
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,060
or for you?

513
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,540
What do you think of this one?

514
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,580
A bit unfashionable.

515
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,620
Unfashionable?

516
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,660
What about this one?

517
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,740
Too outdated.

518
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,420
Which one do you think looks good?

519
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,580
I think this one is good.

520
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,980
What is this? I don't want it.

521
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,060
Try it on.

522
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,820
No.

523
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,460
Try it on.

524
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,860
Is it nice?

525
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,020
Very nice.

526
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,580
Are you sure it's nice?

527
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,500
Are you sure this isn't a nun's outfit?

528
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
How does it look like a nun's outfit?

529
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,340
I think you just picked

530
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,180
the ugliest outfit
in the entire store for me.

531
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,820
Miss.

532
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,620
Bring the ones

533
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,620
I picked earlier.

534
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,360
I want to try them.

535
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,620
Alright, please wait a moment.

536
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,340
It looks good.

538
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,740

539
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,820
Hurry up.

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,740
What are you doing?

541
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,300
Help me zip up.

542
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,900
What? Do it.

543
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,380
Done.

544
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,580
Do I look good?

545
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,160
Why aren't you looking at me?

546
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,820
You look good.

547
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,820
Then why aren't you looking at me?

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,700
I have something to tell you.

550
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,380
Go ahead.

551
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,260

Provide me with your name
and graduation department.

564
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,380
2016 Medical Graduate School Department,
Song Xingchen.

565
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,140
This is the program booklet
for the anniversary.

566
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,500
It details the schedule

567
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,540
and venue.

568
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,580
Alright.

569
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,900
(Haicheng University Activity Center)

570
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,100
Long time no see.

571
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,540
Long time no see.

572
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
How have you been lately?

573
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,180
Not bad.

574
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,260
Well, I'll get going.

575
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,820
Song Xingchen.

576
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,260
Are you avoiding me?

577
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,340
No, I'm not.

578
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,340
Didn't we just greet each other?

579
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,220
The event is about to start.

580
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,980
I'll go ahead.

581
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,820
We should be sitting together.

582
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,580
Let's go together.

583
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:30,980
Okay.

584
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,650
This place is still the same as before.

585
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,620
Nothing has changed.

586
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,540
Right.

587
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,360
Only the teaching building
looks more impressive than before.

588
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,500
Xingchen.

589
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,140
Ms. Bai.

590
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,340
Long time no see.

591
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,500
You're here too, Ruize.

592
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,060
Did you two get married?

593
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,020
Xingchen, you've picked a good one.

594
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,660
Waiting a few years is nothing.

595
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,300
Ruize is now the youngest professor
at our school.

596
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,340
Have you two had a child?

597
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,970
How old is your child?

598
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,620
Ms. Bai.

599
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,100
That's all ancient history.

600
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,210
We broke up a long time ago.

601
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,060
We just met again.

602
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,660
Look at my memory.

603
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,860
I still remember the scenes of you two
being together every day.

604
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,780
Ms. Bai,
the performance is about to begin.

605
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,460
We'll go ahead.

606
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,340
Okay, go ahead.

607
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,010
You need to wear a fluorescent wristband
to enter the theater.

608
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,020
Thank you.

609
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,860
This is a souvenir,
and here's some water.

610
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,860
We don't need this.

611
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,810
She's allergic to mango.

612
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,420
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Give it to me.

613
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,580
I'm not allergic now.

614
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,220
Okay.

615
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,540
When you drank mango milk tea,

616
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,220
you had to take antiallergic medicine.

617
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,620
Allergies can be treated.

618
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,940
You might be allergic

619
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,260
to something at first.

620
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,380
After a while,
you might become desensitized.

621
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,980
Time changes many things.

622
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,300
You are a doctor.

623
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,500
You know more than I do.

624
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,140
(20th Anniversary Celebration
of Haicheng University)

625
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,500
University life is really good.

626
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,020
Remember back then?

627
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,980
Every time we had a meeting
with the student council,

628
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,060
it was in this place.

629
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,140
We used to watch plays together often.

630
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,660
Yes.

631
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,780
I remember when someone stood me up,

632
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,940
and I had to watch a play alone

633
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,220
for three hours here.

634
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,900
Did that happen?

635
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,700
You don't remember?

636
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,300
You were really busy back then.

637
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,860
Actually, I remember.

638
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,940
I just didn't expect you
to still remember.

639
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,620
Oh, please.

640
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,660
Remembering the recklessness of youth

641
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,740
is a sign of aging.

642
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,440
Let's watch the performance.

643
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,460
Hello?

644
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,460
Okay.

645
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,020
I'll come over now.

646
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,860
Time flies, leaving no trace.

647
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,060
In these days of parting,

648
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,380
do you still remember

649
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,100
the promises

650
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,220
we made?

651
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,580
In all the years we've had together,

652
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,220
it's not just me and you,

653
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,860
but also our shared youth

654
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,900
and our shared dreams.

655
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,660
(In the theater. Don't forget this time.
I'll wait for you.)

656

Forever with you.

forget this time. I'll wait for you.)

658
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,580
(Okay, the teacher is looking for me.
Wait for me a moment.)

659
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,380
(Okay, I also have a small surprise.)

660
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,100
Congratulations.

661
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,900
It's a great opportunity
for further study.

Thank you, sir.

664
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,620
I didn't expect it to be me.

665
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,780
It's the result of your hard work.

666

I heard you've
started a business lately.

669

I'd like to visit when you're available.

670
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,540
You've been doing so well abroad.

Why did you return to your hometown?

672
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,180
The country's development is good now.

673
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
I want to contribute
to the education field.

674

(Professor Li: Xingchen, are you here?
I'm waiting for you in the office.)

675
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,140
I made plans to meet Professor Li.

676
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,020
But would it be impolite to go out now?

677
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,060
What are you doing?

678
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,540
If we don't leave now,
we won't be able to leave later.

679
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,540
Follow me.

681
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,570
I didn't expect
that after so long since graduation,

682
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,860
you're still the same,

683
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,900
sneaking out quietly.

684
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,500
It's all your fault just now.

685
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,500
It was embarrassing
with so many people watching.

686
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,100
You care about your image so much.

687
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,100
If you run faster, no one will notice you.

688
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,680
Take your time around the campus.

689
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,380
I'll go ahead.

690
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,020
Did you find me
to discuss the application with me?

691
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,620
Yes.

Your PhD application this year

693
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,500
may not work out.

No, it's not that.

696
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,940
It's the PhD advisor you applied to.

697
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,940
Due to health reasons
and unexpected situations,

he had

699
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,420
to give up enrollment this year.

700
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,900

to adjust your research direction

if you want to continue applying.

702
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,020
So, do you

703
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,580
mean all my past efforts were in vain?

704
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,020
Not exactly.

705
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,340
Or you can wait for other opportunities.

may be a good thing.

being concerned about my PhD studies.

00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,020
(how was the university anniversary?)

748
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,300
It was okay.

749
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,500
What's wrong?

750
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,980
You sound unhappy.

751
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,660
I'm just a bit tired today.

752
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,660
You should go back early and rest.

753
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,420
See you tomorrow.

754
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,780
Qingche.

755
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,460
The list is ready.

756
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,280
I see Song Xingchen
is on the medical team.

757
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,100
Yes.

758
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,580
She hasn't been on a mission

759
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,860
(Transport personnel arrangements)
since becoming a reserve member.

760
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,580
We happen to need her this time.

761
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,320
(Qingyin)

762
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,740
Hello, Qingyin.

763
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Qingche.

764
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,540
You finally answered my call.

765
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,260
What are you doing?

766
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,060
I'm working.

767
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,420
I'm almost done shooting here.

768
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,910
I'll be flying back in a couple of days.

769
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,460
Can you pick me up?

770
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,220
Probably not.

771
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,020
I'm quite busy these days.

772
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,180
How about I

773
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,940
ask Lu Qun to pick you up instead?

774
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,100
I need to get going now.

775
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,020
Why should I go?

776
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,420
I have my dignity too.

777
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,980
You…

778
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,380
I'm the vice captain too.

779
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,780
There are two main challenges

780
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,380
for this vaccine transport mission.

781
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,300
First,

782
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,800
the urgency
of cold chain transportation.

783
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,700
Second,

784
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
the mountainous areas

785
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,460
with no signal in some places

786
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,110
due to the absence of base stations.

787
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,540
These two points must be noted,

788
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,980
and you all should be ready in advance.

789
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,060
Does everyone understand?

790
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,100
Yes, sir.

791
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,500
Song Xingchen.

792
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,940
Make sure to stay in touch

793
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,820
with the local medical stations
during transport.

794
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,620
I'll make sure everything is prepared.

795
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,900
Everyone, get ready.

796
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,380
We will depart tomorrow. Dismiss.

797
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,540
By the way, Dr. Song…

798
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,500
What's wrong with her?

799
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,570
She's been acting weird
since the university anniversary.

800
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,580
Let's focus on the vaccine first.

801
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,220
She's not an ordinary woman.

802
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,460
You need to be attentive.

803
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,500
What are you doing?
Are you riding in my car?

804
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,220
What else?

805
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,340
Dr. Song.

806
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,060
You can ride with us.

807
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,340
No need.

808
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,740
I'll follow the main group.

809
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,940
See you later.

810
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,580
Okay.

811
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,690
It's not that I don't help you, buddy.

812
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,900
You talk too much.

813
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,820
I did it all for your sake.

814
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,380
Two refrigeration units

815
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,900
and all rescue tools are ready.

816
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,620
We're good to go.

817
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,500
Let's go quickly.

818
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,570
We must arrive before dark.

819
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,860
You drive.

820
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,300
You…

821
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,180
Depart!

822
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,920
♪The future is a constantly
spinning spinning top♪

823
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,620

♪Like the stars embracing the vastness♪

830
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,450
(Tang Ruize: I was abrupt that day.
It's been a while since I return.)

831
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,820
(Can you show me
around the city when you're free?)

832
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,520
(Let's discuss later.
I'm on a business trip.)

833
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,920
(Song Xingchen: Let's discuss later.
I'm on a business trip.)

834
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,740
Vehicle operation is normal.

835
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,580
Xingchen.

836
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,020
(Xingchen.)

837
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,620
Xingchen.

838
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,660
I heard Captain Lu say

839
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,820
you were dating Captain Su.

840
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,900
(Really?)

841
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,540
(I can't imagine it too.)

842
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,940
(Someone like Captain Su,)

843
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,540
(who always has a stern face,)

844
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,900
(can actually find a girlfriend.)

845
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,780
I thought he would grow old alone.

846
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,340
(So, do none of us have a chance now?)

847
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,620
Not us.

848
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,660
It's you.

849
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,420
Little daydreamer.

850
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,940
Xingchen.

851
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,580
Are you really together with Captain Su?

852
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,300
We're just friends.

853
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,340
Girls are rather shy

854
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,420
to admit that.

855
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,780
But I think she definitely
has feelings for you.

856
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,980
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

857
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,940
It's okay.

858
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,940
Focus on driving.

859
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,940
Do you really not like him at all?

860
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,780
When did you become so nosy?

861
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,100
Did you learn from Lin Mu?

862
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,180
You didn't learn the good things.

863
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,100
Instead, you've
mastered the art of gossiping.

864
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,660
Humans have curiosity.

865
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,660
Besides,

866
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,700
Captain Su's personal life

867
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,420
(directly)

868
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,380
(affects our team's happiness index.)

869
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,860
He's quite sensible.

870
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,980
Xingchen.

871
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,740
What's the situation now?

872
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,500
You didn't reject him, did you?

873
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,380
Not to that extent.

874
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,060
He…

875
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,610
Did you forget to turn off the intercom?

876
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,340
See.

877
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,220
She didn't say no.

878
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,260
So, don't be impatient.

879
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,420
Good things take time.

880
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,860
Don't worry too much.

881
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,300
Focus on driving.
