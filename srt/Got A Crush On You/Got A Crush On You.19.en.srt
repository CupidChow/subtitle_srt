I'm sorry.

26
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,780
Why is he here?

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,940
Because you're not.

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,580
That's why I came.

29
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,350
Since you're here,

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,420
I should leave.

31
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,540

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,780

Take a seat.

34
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,660
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,860
I had no choice today.

36
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,580
I know. I understand.

37
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,660
But I was really awkward just now.

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,620
If not for Tang Ruize,

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,700
I would've been desperate
to find a hiding place.

40
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,460
Should I thank him, then?

41
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,220
During my time in Hezhou,

42
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,300
he helped you solve the store's issues.

Should I thank him too?

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,370
What are you trying to say?

45
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,420
I just feel

46
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,420
that even without me by your side,

47
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,500
he could somehow make up for my absence.

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,580
Why is he here?

53

I don't want us to be buddies?

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,380
and disturb my rest.

102
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,660

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,700
After finding that child yesterday,

111
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,380
I rushed back.

112
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,500
But when I got there,

113
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,330
Tang Ruizhe was there too.

114
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,620
He even gave her a bouquet of flowers,

115
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,180
making it look like they were on a date.

116
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,140
I knew I was at fault

117
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,100
because I was late.

118
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,780
Anyway, I felt really uncomfortable.

119
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,700
She left afterward

120
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,880
without replying to me.

121
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,380
I get you.

122
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,300
If I were you,

123
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,860
I would've felt wronged too.

124
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,020
It just feels

125
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,300
like I could be replaced at any moment.

126
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,050
But I can't do anything about it.

127
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,740
Rescue work used to be my top priority,

128
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,690
so I didn't understand,

129
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,020
but now it does feel different

130
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,900
to have someone worry about you

131
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,590
and wait for you.

132
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,820
True.

133
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,940
It's hard to balance work and family.

134
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,620
I was indeed at fault yesterday.

135
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,820
I promised her

136
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
we'd spend Qixi Festival,

137
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,060
so she booked a restaurant

138
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,310
and took the effort to dress up,

139
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,520
but I couldn't arrive on time.

140
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,740
Wait. It is your fault,

141
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,340
but what's strange

142
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,980
is that Tang Ruize was there.

143
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,060
Did he come on his own?

144
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,100
Or did she tell him?

145
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,220
She invited her ex
just because you were late.

146
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,100
Shouldn't she explain herself?

147
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,780
I'll definitely ask her about it.

148
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,700
I'll see her in a while.

149
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,260
I can't stand the silent treatment.

150
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,220
So, have you talked things
out with Su Qingche?

151
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,900
We almost had a quarrel.

152
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,180
Given the situation,

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,990
I didn't want to explain.

154
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,980
Oh, my.

155
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,580
If I were out on a mission,

156
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,820
I would've felt guilty

157
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,700
for not being with you

158
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,220
when you were in trouble.

159
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,340
But suddenly,

160
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,940
your ex shows up

161
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,420
and I happen to bump into him

162
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,020
spending the evening with you.

163
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,140
Don't you think

164
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,300
I'd be extremely jealous?

165
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,010
Anyway, I can't bring myself to say it

166
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,260
unless he asks.

167
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,350
Professor Tang is here.

168
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,010
I'll leave you guys alone.

169
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,830
I have to deal
with the video account matters.

170
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,460
Sure.

171
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
What brings you here?

172
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,700
Nothing happened between you
and Su Qingche yesterday, right?

173
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,100
We're fine.

174
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,420
Do you need me to explain to him?

175
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,090
No, thanks.
You didn't do anything wrong.

176
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,170
I should've thanked you.

177
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,460
I came over today

178
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,660
to discuss something with you.

179
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,700
What's up?

180
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,960
(Recommendation Letter)

181
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
A recommendation letter?

182
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
This way, you can apply

183
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,940
for their Ph.D. program this year

184
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,900
instead of next year.

185
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,300
How did you get my information?

186
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,980
I got it from Professor Li.

187
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,740
Thank you.

188
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,660
I didn't expect

189
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,340
you would remember all of it,

190
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,060
but I can't take it.

191
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,100
Why not?

192
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm looking to apply for another major,

193
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,180
but still, thank you.

194
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,900
Isn't it OBGYN?

195
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,020
OBGYN

196
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,780
has many different research aspects.

197
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,380
I know about this school.

198
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,880
It doesn't offer that specialization.

199
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,620
I never knew that.

200
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,420
Should I get someone else to help?

201
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,420
No, thanks. I got it.

202
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,140
But I appreciate your help,

203
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,270
and I'll repay you for it.

204
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,580
I wasn't of much help anyway.

205
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,260
Alright, then. I'm leaving now.

206
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,740
Wasn't that

207
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,630
the specialization
you were going to apply for?

208
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,740
I got it.

209
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,760
You're doing this because Su Qingche

210
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,740
might mind, right?

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,420
Not entirely.

212
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,300
It's a great favor.

213
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,120
I can't repay him.

214
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,060
That's true.

215
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,420
Su Qingche.

216
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,670
Why are you here?

217
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,860
I came today

218
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,780
to talk to you about two things.

219
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:00,940
Go on.

220
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,620
The first thing

221
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,340
is about last night.

222
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,940
Xingchen dressed up

223
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,100
and ordered a table full of dishes

224
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
just to accompany you.

225
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,620
Yes.

226
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,100
You were going to rescue someone.

227
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,660
You were going on a mission.

228
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,770
You were not wrong.

229
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,460
But as a boyfriend,

230
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,700
do you think you were being reasonable?

231
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,180
I know all of this.

232
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,300
I'll explain it to Xingchen,

233
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,170
and I will apologize to her.

234
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:30,860
Okay.

235
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,260
Second thing.

236
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,360
Xingchen wants to study further.

237
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,300
Do you know about it?

238
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,940
I know.

239
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,450
Then how much do you know?

240
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,780
If she doesn't pursue further studies,

241
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,710
she won't have a chance at all.

242
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,590
Is she going to pack parcels every day?

243
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,000
She studied medicine
for so many years for nothing.

244
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,260
Even so,

245
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,860
I asked a professor
to write her recommendation letter.

246
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,860
but she refused.

247
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,370
She's afraid that you would mind,

248
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,850
so she wants
to distance herself from me.

249
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,700
So I hope

250
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,100
you can persuade her

251
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,500
to cherish this opportunity.

252
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,940
Even if Xingchen is strong

253
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,900
and independent,

254
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,380
she's still a girl.

255
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,460
She needs care and protection.

256
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,260
If you're a man,

257
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,890
you should reflect on yourself.

258
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,340
I'm done.

259
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,900
You're done shopping already?

260
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,050
I heard you rejected
Tang Ruize's recommendation letter.

261
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,580
Did he look for you?

262
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,580
Hasn't going abroad for a PhD

263
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,140
always been your dream?

264
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,740
Why don't you accept it?

265
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,340
If you accept,

266
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,390
you won't have to wait another year.

267
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,700
You can immediately do what you want.

268
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm happy with my choice.

269
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,180
Anything wrong?

270
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,020
Xingchen.

271
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,660
Listen to me.

272
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
I just don't want...

273
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,180
I just don't want you

274
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,900
to give up what you really want to do
because of me.

275
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
You came today

276
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,020
just to talk to me about this?

277
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,580
I came to apologize to you.

278
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,140
I'm sorry for last night.

279
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,620
I was wrong.

280
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,300
It won't happen again.

281
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,470
But today, Tang Ruize came to see me,

282
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
and I think he's right.

283
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,660
I don't want to be a burden to you.

284
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,460
I don't want to be a burden

285
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,790
in your life.

286
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,020
So?

287
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,180
Do you want me to call Tang Ruize now

288
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,770
and get the opportunity back?

289
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,720
No need for you to call.

290
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
I can call for you.

291
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,540
Xingchen, calm down.

292
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,860
Let me analyze...

293
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,580
Get out.

294
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,740
I don't need anyone's help.

295
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
I can handle

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,860

So why are you not sleeping

320
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,580
and clown-dancing here?

321
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,820

I have neurasthenia?

I am not dancing at your house.

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,100
Why do you care?

334
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,050
Who's your madam?

335
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,230
If you want to dance, you can,

336
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,540
but can you go to somewhere else?

337
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,300
Dance in the square downstairs
as you like.

338
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,350
Nobody will bother you
even if you dance to the sky.

339
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:50,680
You...

340
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,800
You have such a strong smell of alcohol.

341
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,740
Are you drunk?

342
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,140
Disturbing me in the middle
of the night after drinking?

343
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,820
I only drank half a bottle of beer.

344
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,220
- I'm very clear-headed.
- Alright.

345
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,130
I don't care
how many bottles of beer you drank.

346
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,090
Go back where you come from.

347
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,300
Otherwise, I'll call the police

348
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,410
and say you're harassing me.

349
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,060
Oh my, why did you sleep here?

350
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,900
I'm so annoyed.

351
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,090
There hasn't been
a single good thing lately.

352
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,420
Someone moved in upstairs.

353
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,420
He dances at home every night.

354
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,500
It's so noisy.

355
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,580
I can't sleep at all.

356
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,990
Let me tell you.

357
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,580
You should report him to the management.

358
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,450
Let them handle it.

359
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,040
I did that.

360
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,940
Once the management went there,
he quieted down.

361
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,910
But as soon as they left,

362
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,570
he started again.

363
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,690
The most ridiculous thing is,

364
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,860
he even blamed the management,

365
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,570
saying they disturbed his rest
at midnight.

366
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,420
What... What kind of person is this?

367
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,500
He made noise until 4:00 a.m. every day.

368
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,790
Just when it finally stopped,

369
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,420
I couldn't sleep.

370
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,660
What about Su Qingche?

371
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,200
Are you still not talking to each other?

372
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,380
It's all because
of Tang Ruize's recommendation letter.

373
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,380
Su Qingche thought

374
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,500
that I refused Tang Ruize
because of him.

375
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,860
So, you refused Tang Ruize's help,

376
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,340
but when Su Qingche found out,

377
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,940
he felt like he was dragging you down.

378
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,900
I rejected Tang Ruize

379
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,060
because I don't want to owe him a favor.

380
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,780
Also, I want to draw clear boundaries.

381
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,340
Why did he react so strongly?

382
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,300
Babe.

383
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,330
Yes, the mission of a best friend

384
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,860
is supposed to curse men with you,

385
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,540
but

386
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,580
as an onlooker,

387
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,380
I think Su Qingche

388
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
is a person

389
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,860
with a very proud personality.

390
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,940
He will absolutely not allow himself

391
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,340
to become your burden

392
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,100
or someone who causes trouble.

393
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,420
He probably feels

394
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
that he's caused you

395
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,380
to make this decision,

396
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,380
which might hurt his self-esteem a bit.

397
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,860
What about you?

398
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,220
How's you and Lu Qun?

399
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,420
Has he come to see you again?

400
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,180
He came.

401
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,100
But

402
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,900
my heart is firm.

403
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,820
Since he doesn't want
to set clear boundaries

404
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,610
with those girls,

405
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,620
I don't need to play games with him.

406
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,860
True.

407
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,700
Let's focus on our work.

408
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,820
You're right.

409
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,980
I'm so sleepy.

410
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,540
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

411
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,500
Let's take a break for now.

412
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,600
Let me announce a mission.

413
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,220
In the past month,

414
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,820
Qin has been shooting videos

415
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,740
for our video channel,

416
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,340
and the response has been very good.

417
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,780
Especially the one with Lin Mu.

418
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,050
It has over a thousand comments.

419
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,460
So, the team has decided

420
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,460
that starting today,

421
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,520
we'll have a weekly update.

422
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,260
Everyone needs to participate.

423
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,380
No excuses will be accepted.

424
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,430
For the next episode,
Ding Weiling, it's your turn.

425
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,180
Sure, no problem.

426
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,150
In our video channel,

427
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,350
there's high interest in videos

428
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,850
about women's self-defense techniques.

429
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,970
I hope you can create a video

430
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,580
about how women

431
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,100
can defend themselves after an attack.

432
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
But you need a male team member
to partner with.

433
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,840
Who wants to do it?

434
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,540
I'll do it.

435
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,220
I can do it too.

436
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:18,990
Count me in.

437
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,420
I'm up for it.

438
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,380
Getting beaten up, right?
I have experience.

439
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,990
Are you addicted to acting or what?

440
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,410
Didn't you just shoot one recently?

441
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,260
As Captain Lu said,

442
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,130
rotating appearances
is the rule we set today.

443
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,520
So, the previous ones don't count.

444
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,410
Right, Captain Lu?

445
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Lin Mu is right.

446
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,340
Everyone

447
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,780
should learn from Lin Mu.

448
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,370
Have self-discipline in training
and be proactive in tasks.

449
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:40,950
It's you, then.

450
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,660
Yes, sir.

451
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,300
Ready? Three, two, one, go.

452
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,940
The first move,

453
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,900
when someone taps your shoulder.

454
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,620
Wait a second.

455
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,500
Lin Mu.

456
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,220
Can you act a bit creepier?

457
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,340
Yes, that's it. It's perfect.
Let's continue.

458
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,540
The first move.

459
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,620
When someone taps your shoulder
from behind...

460
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,580
Hey, little girl.

461
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,580
First, grab their hand

462
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,480
and twist it backward.

463
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,900
Okay, cut.

464
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,500
Lin Mu, don't forget

465
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,460
to act creepy.

466
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,220
Okay.

467
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,500
Ready? Three, two, one, go.

468
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,620
Now, let's learn the second move.

469
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,540
When someone approaches you

470
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,620
and you feel threatened...

471
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,380
Let's go have a drink with me, babe.

472
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,580
Hey, what are you doing here?

473
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,180
You...

474
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,700
You...

475
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,460
You...

476
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,700
The third move.

477
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,500
When someone grabs your throat,

478
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,180
hold their shoulder and do this.

479
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,700
Okay, cut.

480
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,380
I think we have enough material
for today.

481
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,300
If it's not enough,

482
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,310
I'll get your help again.

483
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,820
- Okay.
- Good work.

484
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,340
Good work.

485
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,140
What's wrong?

486
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,300
- I'm fine.
- You're bleeding.

487
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,500
Call Sun Yizhu.

488
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,060
Okay.

489
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,620
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

490
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,710
How are you?

491
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,500
Easy.

492
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,620
Did you get hurt?

493
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,100
- No, I'm fine.
- Let me check.

494
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,580
How'd you get hurt?

495
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,490
I heard a kid
fell into the sewer yesterday.

496
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,040
It was Lin Mu who responded to the call.

497
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,160
Maybe he got hurt back then.

498
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,900
I was careless.

499
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,900
When I jumped in there,

500
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,300
I got scraped by a rock by accident.

501
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,380
It's nothing serious.

502
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,900
Excuse me, please.

503
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,380
It's no big deal.

504
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,590
I'll reapply antiseptic

505
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,680
and rebandage the wound.

506
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,310
Sun Yizhu,
someone's looking for you.

507
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,100
Okay.

508
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,780
Give me a minute.

509
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,620
It's okay. I'll handle this.
You go ahead.

510
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,340
I got this.

511
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,700
Okay.

512
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,300
Bear with it.

513
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,100
Does it hurt?

514
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,380
No.

515
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,660
Why push yourself with a leg injury?

516
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,180
Don't you know that I'm rough?

517
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,340
I know.

518
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,420
But with all that hugging,

519
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,020
I didn't want someone else to do it.

520
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,010
I've never seen an idiot like you.

521
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,770
Don't be so reckless next time.

522
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,300
Got it?

523
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,260
Yeah.

524
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,500
It feels so nice
to be cared for by you.

525
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,300
Can you walk?

526
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,420
Yeah.

527
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,900
Where do you live?

528
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,980
What's wrong?

529
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,550
I need to take responsibility for this.

530
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,770
Come on, I'll take you home.

531
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,260
I live in Haicheng's Yongshu District.

532
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,660
Room 302, Unit 4,
No. 32 Yingcheng Street.

533
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Let's go.

534
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,220
Does Lin Mu stand a chance?

535
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,180
What do you think?

536
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,620
Have you ever seen Weiling

537
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,980
so concerned about a guy before?

538
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,780
Isn't it so?

539
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,900
(Qiancheng, I need your urgent help.)

540
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,100
(You have to help me.)

541
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,220
Bro.

542
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,140
I have classes this afternoon.

543
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,450
(Gao Qingyin will also be there.)

544
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,420
She'll be there too?

545
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:35,980
(Yes.)

546
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,100
Okay.

547
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,390
Send me the address.

548
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,290
I'll be there on time.

549
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:39,620
(Sure.)

550
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,330
You're aquaphobic and can't swim.

551
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,420
Why'd they assign you to a job like this?

552
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,140
Anyway, I've sorted it out with them.

553
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,820
We'll avoid modeling underwater.

554
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,700
The water's heated, by the way.

555
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
Since I'm here,

556
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,660
I'll be cooperative.

557
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,700
There's something I forgot to tell you.

558
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,940
Our modeling job this time

559
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,300
involves Qiancheng.

560
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,940
Qiancheng?

561
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,500
Why would he be here too?

562
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,580
I heard he was called in
as a last-minute replacement.

563
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,620
Fine.

564
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,620
He'll make me look good in the shot.

565
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,860
Nothing else matters.

566
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,980
Aren't you upset?

567
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,460
Upset?

568
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,860
Why should I?

569
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,060
I never said I wouldn't work with him.

570
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,380
Didn't you previously

571
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,380
include him on your blacklist?

572
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,820
Don't worry about it.

573
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,260
I've attended freediving classes.

574
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,300
It's just posing in a mermaid tail.

575
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,180
I can manage it.

576
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,700
Qingyin, you're finally here.

577
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,080
Shall we start, then?

578
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,740
Sure.

579
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,340
Qingyin.

580
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,710
What a coincidence.

581
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,340
It surely is.

582
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,700
Last time on the beach,

583
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,190
didn't you say you couldn't swim?

584
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,780
I'll try to keep up.

585
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,580
Okay. Thank you for that.

586
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,420
What's going on with you guys?

587
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,820
The water's too cold.

588
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,100
Isn't supposed to be heated?

589
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,860
We're really sorry.

590
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,700
We were told

591
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,890
that the heat pump broke down
halfway through heating.

592
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,660
There's nothing we could do.

593
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,900
Nothing, huh?

594
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,700
Fine.

595
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,460
You don't keep your word.

596
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,010
Qingyin, let's go. We're not doing this.

597
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,580
It's okay. I'm not that fragile.

598
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,300
But you have other jobs later.

599
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,740
It's okay. I can manage. Let's get ready.

600
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,100
Let's work together.

601
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,740
Same to you.

602
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,460
Come on, let's do it again.

603
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,100
One more take.

604
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,180
Go down a little further.

605
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,500
Okay, come on up.

606
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,700
Gao Qingyin.

607
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,420
Anyone there?

608
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,980
Help...

609
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,820
What's happening?
Hurry and get in there.

610
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:29,940
Qingyin.

611
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,780
Qingyin, are you okay?

612
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,380
I'm fine.

613
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,780
Put this on quickly.

614
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,500
Who's there?

615
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,500
It's me, Qiancheng.

616
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm alone here. Come on in.

617
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,580
Are you okay?

618
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,540
I'm fine.

619
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,660
Sorry about earlier.

620
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
It's okay. You didn't mean it.

621
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
But you can't swim.

622
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,780
Why jump in to save me back then?

623
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,100
I was worried about you.

624
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,580
So I jumped on the spur of the moment.

625
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,460
You're really stupid.

626
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,020
Don't do this anymore.

627
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,060
Where's Mengnan?

628
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,980
She went to buy something.

629
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,300
Lend me a hand.

630
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,740
If you keep staring,

631
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,150
I might catch a cold for real.

632
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,260
I'm sorry.

633
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,060
Qingyin.

634
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,660
You're different today.

635
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,020
How am I different?

636
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,290
Our partner
didn't follow your instructions

637
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,630
to raise the water temperature.

638
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,420
Not only didn't you get angry,

639
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,370
but you also cooperated with me.

640
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,740
What kind

641
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,180
of a person do you think I am?

642
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,580
There are all sorts

643
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,340
of problems happening at the set.

644
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,300
What else can I do if I don't cooperate?

645
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,580
But about the photoshoot for Stardust?

646
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,260
I heard about it.

647
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,540
Come on, please.

648
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,620
I disliked Song Xingchen back then,

649
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,020
so I deliberately teased her.

650
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,460
If I lacked professionalism,

651
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,180
could my work schedule be so full?

652
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,100
I came here to work,

653
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,500
not to pick fights.

654
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,460
Thanks for today.

655
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,540
What are you doing?

656
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,300
Qingyin almost drowned because of you.

657
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,630
How dare you come to find her?

658
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,700
- I came over...
- For what?

659
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,260
You can't even swim.

660
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Aren't you afraid others
would laugh at you?

661
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,700
Mengnan.

662
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,540
Am I wrong?

663
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,180
I think he did it on purpose.

664
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,820
Alright. Take a good rest.
I'll leave first.

665
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,700
It's fine, Qingyin.
Don't be afraid of him.

666
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,060
Alright. He's just being kind.

667
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,540
Nothing happened to me,

668
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,060
so there's nothing to be upset about.

669
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,300
How can I not be upset?

670
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,140
Besides, he and Song Xingchen
are in cahoots.

671
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,740
Come, let me
help you blow-dry your hair.

672
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
(Haicheng City Rescue Center)

673
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,540
(Lu Qun: Didn't you say you
want to be buddies with me?)

674
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,860
(There's a gathering tonight.
Will you go?)

675
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,460
(Lu Qun: If you come, it means you
see me as a buddy,)

676
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,140
(or else it means you
agree to let me pursue you.)

677
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,270
(Han Xiaoli: Okay.
Send me the time and address.)

678
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,180
Yes!

679
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,060
(No pornography, gambling, and drugs)

680
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,820
Here she comes.

681
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,500
Xiaoli.

682
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,140
You came.

683
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,580
You look pretty in this.

684
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,220
Lu Qun.

685
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,300
Is this the person you wanted to bring?

686
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,140
Yes, she's my...

687
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,580
She's my buddy,

688
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,100
so no one is to make her drink.

689
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,720
What should I call you?

690
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,340
I'm Han Xiaoli.

691
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,900
Hello, I'm Liang Heng.

692
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,700
I'm Lu Qun's schoolmate from university,

693
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,330
but I'm from a different class and batch.

694
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:55,980
Lu Qun.

695
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,820
Is she also in your group?

696
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,340
What group?

697
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,380
No.

698
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,880
A group. A group of people came today.

699
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,870
Look at all those people.

700
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,220
You came.

701
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,220
What do you think of the crowd tonight?

702
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,410
There's quite a lot of people.

703
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,160
Of course.

704
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:16,820
Drinks.

705
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,460
Go have fun.

706
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,020
No. I'll be over there.

707
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,370
Call me if you need anything.

708
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,980
I've prepared cheerful ones,

709
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,820
active ones, cute ones,
and reserved ones today.

710
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,380
Aren't cheerful
and active the same type?

711
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,960
Well, not exactly.

712
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,060
They're divided into older
and younger ones.

713
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,620
Younger ones are considered active,

714
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,700
while older ones
are considered cheerful.

715
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,780
They're different,

716
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,870
and depends on your liking.

717
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,580
My taste is similar
to that of high school girls.

718
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,140
How about the school bully type?

719
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,300
You're in luck. I am the school bully.

720
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,780
Dear junior, you...

721
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,540
By the way, I wanted to ask you

722
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,480
about what's going on with Su Qingche.

723
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,240
Xingchen's neighbor

724
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,700
has been driving her crazy recently,

725
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,820
and he's making things worse.

726
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,580
That guy's stupid.

727
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,540
Give him some time,

728
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,540
and I'll talk to him.

729
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,220
What about Miss Song again?

730
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,940
My God.

731
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,540
Recently,

732
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,100
an annoying neighbor moved upstairs

733
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,540
and would start tap dancing

734
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,650
every night after 11.00 p.m.

735
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,700
He wouldn't stop

736
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,790
until early in the morning.

737
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,940
It has almost driven Xingchen crazy.

738
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,660
Has it? No worries. I'll take care of it.

739
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,300
Lu Qun.

740
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,420
Come and have a drink.

741
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,340
Okay. I'll be there in a minute.

742
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,420
I need to go and entertain my friends.

743
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,220
Go ahead.

744
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,930
You should go and pick a song.

745
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,860
What are you guys up to?

746
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,320
Hey, I haven't seen you before.

747
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,340
I'm Lu Qun. You?

748
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,300
I know you.

749
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,340
I'm Xia Wan.

750
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,300
My WeChat ID is Nini.

751
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,900
Have we met?

752
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,740
Don't you remember?

753
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,060
It's fine. I'll remember today.

754
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,260
Nice to meet you.

755
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,260
Hey, beautiful.

756
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,260
Are you bored?

757
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,260
No.

758
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,620
I'm enjoying playing on my phone.

759
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,470
It's fine. I'll have a drink with you.

760
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,860
Sure.

761
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,780
Great.

762
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,460
What were you guys talking about?

763
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,140
I'll talk with her here.

764
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,660
You can just talk over here.

765
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,340
What's the topic?

766
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,420
Fine.

767
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,190
We're done here.

768
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,740
Let's...

769
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,700
Let's chat on Wechat.

770
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,700
Sure.

771
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,140
You guys talk.

772
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,610
Did you add his Wechat?

773
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,810
Didn't you hold this gathering for me?

774
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,300
What now?

775
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,220
You can.

776
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,140
Well, how
about playing rock, paper, scissors?

777
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,300
Drink until we drop.

778
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,060
Game on. Let's see who wins.

779
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,140
Zhou Yao, help me get two glasses.

780
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,620
Sure.

781
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,260
Excuse me.

782
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,350
I'd like to request a song.

783
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,620
Miss Xia, can I invite you for a drink?

784
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Thanks but no need.

785
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,060
But how did you know my name?

786
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,260
I heard your friends
calling you that earlier.

787
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,900
Hello, I'm Xia Wan.

788
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,660
Hello.

789
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,460
Can I add you on Wechat?

790
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,540
Sure.

791
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:48,980
Here.

792
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,860
(Han Xiaoli)

793
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,100
Done.

794
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,060
(Galaxy Mansion, Block C)

795
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,100
Xia Wan.

796
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,360
(Go to Hell, Playboy)
(Xia Wan: Everyone, this is Seven.)

797
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,900
(Show her our chat history.)

798
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,420
Seven? What chat history?

799
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,940
(Lu Qun: I like you a lot, really.)

800
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,980
(I've never met a woman)

801
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,510
(Lu Qun: I'm drunk. I miss you.)
(as special and unique as you.)

802
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,030
(Of course, I won't like anyone else.)

803
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,500
(Have you heard of the song,)

804
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,540
("only have feelings for you"?)

805
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,510
(Xia Wan: We've all been
deceived by Lu Qun.)

806
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,140
(We initially wanted to confront him,)

807
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,820
(but he acted completely innocent.)

808
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,800
(We couldn't get anything out of him.)

809
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,700
(You're the seventh one already.)

810
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,980
The seventh one?

811
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,340
A leopard indeed can't change its spots.

812
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,540
How dare he
pretend to have changed his ways?

813
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,180
How about we set him up?

814
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,660
I'll get Lu Qun to come out.

815
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,500
If he doesn't apologize to us,

816
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,340
we'll give him a beating.

817
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,980
Lu Qun, just you wait.
