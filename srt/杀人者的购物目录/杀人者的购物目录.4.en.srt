1
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,942
Two, two, three, four,

2
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:41,073
five, six, seven, back and stomach.

3
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:47,413
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

4
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:50,783
Two, two, three, four,

5
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:53,823
five, six, seven, the twist.

6
00:00:53,823 --> 00:01:00,663
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

7
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:04,032
Two, two, three, four,

8
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:07,373
five, six, seven, the row.

9
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:13,512
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

10
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:16,742
Where's Veggie?

11
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,812
Did anyone get a call?

12
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,183
That's weird.

13
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:23,852
She's not the type to be late.

14
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,910
Shall I call her?

15
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,941
Yes, call her.

16
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,579
No. Let's wait until it's time to open up.

17
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,619
- Sorry I'm late. - Hey.

18
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:38,749
Goodness.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,290
What's wrong? Are you sick or something?

20
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,320
I didn't sleep a wink.

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,260
- Someone followed me home. - What?

22
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,400
The energy here is not good, I tell you.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,460
So, are you all right?

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,470
Yes. I screamed and he ran off.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,040
His face. Did you see his face?

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,440
No. I only saw his shadow, not his face.

27
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,379
Are you sure he followed you?

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,640
When did you first notice him?

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,780
You know the convenience store on the main road, right?

30
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:07,779
From there.

31
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,940
I'll walk you home from now on.

32
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,879
No, you don't have to. It's fine.

33
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,349
It's not fine.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
You walk her home for a while.

35
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:45,089
Call the police immediately if you see someone fishy.

36
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,289
Okay.

37
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:48,389
You must've been scared.

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,720
Try to relax.

39
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,590
Hey.

40
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,799
You dropped this.

41
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:59,099
Oh, thanks.

42
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:03,669
I thought I'd lost it again.

43
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,969
Thank you.

44
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,939
Goodness. Who on earth was that?

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,050
Oh, my. Do you have anyone in mind?

46
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,320
Gosh. How could something like this happen?

47
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,500
- What? - Hold on.

48
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,669
(MS Mart)

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,410
What is it? It's cold in here.

50
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,339
When you walk Veggie home today, watch out for Fish.

51
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:42,479
Fish? Why?

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,980
Does she not like fish?

53
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:45,379
Gosh.

54
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,249
I was going to get some sashimi since we'd be hungry by then.

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,620
- What are you talking about? - What?

56
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,749
I'm talking about the worker, Fish. Watch out for him.

57
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,219
I see. Why?

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,720
If he's the one following Veggie, you call me right away.

59
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,389
- Don't try to catch him. - Why not?

60
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,389
Does he like her too?

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,330
"Too"?

62
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,970
- Does she have an admirer? - No.

63
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,499
I mean, a lot of people like her.

64
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,669
So many of our customers became regulars because of her.

65
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,710
Now, there's a stalker too.

66
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,479
- It's not you, right? - What? What do you mean?

67
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,610
She's married.

68
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,709
- You don't like her, right? - Gosh, no way.

69
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,179
Is walking her home that odd?

70
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,519
Do you want to join us too?

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,950
But aren't you closing today?

72
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,050
Yes. I should.

73
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Gosh. It can't be him, right?

74
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,470
Gosh. But why do I get the feeling...

75
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,239
Yes, he does. He likes her.

76
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,769
What?

77
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,870
Meat likes Veggie.

78
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,709
Everyone but you knows. Even Veggie knows.

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,180
What?

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,010
You remember all sorts of things.

81
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:56,249
But how could you miss what's right in front of you?

82
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,749
Well, she's married.

83
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,720
You can't like a married woman.

84
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,119
She cannot be the object of your love

85
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,329
But loving her

86
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,999
My goodness. You're so dense.

87
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,169
(MS Mart)

88
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,800
But still. She's married.

89
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,809
Isn't it illegal to like a married woman?

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,340
Is it not?

91
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,079
Hello.

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,950
Veggie!

93
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,259
I'll break it all!

94
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,789
What are you doing?

95
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,029
I'm calling from MS Mart.

96
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,570
A fugitive threw a rock at the window, and it broke.

97
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:48,369
No. I'm not a fugitive!

98
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,839
I was innocent.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,170
So they released me.

100
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,910
This is all your fault.

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,010
My life is ruined!

102
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,450
As for all the money I tried so hard to keep,

103
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,590
I had to spend every cent of it to pay the fine!

104
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,919
I don't know how my creditors found me.

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,920
They all tracked me down and came to me.

106
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:12,929
This is all your fault!

107
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,400
Why is that my fault? You lived a wrong life!

108
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,759
It's your fault.

109
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,530
If you had pretended...

110
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,570
as if nothing was wrong...

111
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,639
and let it slide when we first met,

112
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,639
nothing would have happened!

113
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:29,809
Do you think you work for the bank?

114
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,909
Are you the one printing money?

115
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,250
If you kept your mouth shut, everything would have been fine.

116
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,419
My life was ruined all because of you!

117
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,520
You attacked my mother!

118
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,400
Officer Do, relax.

119
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,970
Relax.

120
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,730
How could they release him without any warnings like this?

121
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,940
Look! He went straight to the supermarket to harass them.

122
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,040
According to Detective Choi, someone else is the suspect.

123
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,269
This won't do.

124
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,039
- I must get to the supermarket. - Hey.

125
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,350
We got a report. We're on duty. We must check out the report first.

126
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:10,779
Patrol Unit 11.

127
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,320
Is there anyone who can capture...

128
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,849
an abandoned dog near Jinsong Apartment?

129
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,190
Everyone is out on a call. We're the only ones available.

130
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,729
Let's wrap this up quickly and check on Dae Sung. Okay?

131
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,190
Gosh. That darned dog.

132
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,730
Officer Do. I get that you go by Do Crazy.

133
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,500
But you can't curse into the radio.

134
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:29,199
No. I was talking about the dog.

135
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,469
The abandoned dog is so big that it's threatening the residents.

136
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,780
I'll catch the dog at lightning speed.

137
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:49,619
Why did it have to be...

138
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,520
our supermarket?

139
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,629
If you had gone to a different supermarket,

140
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:55,999
it wouldn't have happened.

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
If you didn't show up in front of me,

142
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:03,469
I could have lived a normal life too.

143
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,639
Why did you come to our supermarket?

144
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,779
Why did you do that in front of me? Why did it have to be me?

145
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,619
Because of you...

146
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,559
See? Now, his true colours are showing.

147
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:31,459
Look at my head.

148
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,269
This jerk tried to kill me.

149
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:36,999
He pretends to be the good guy.

150
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,039
Hadn't you gotten involved, nothing would have happened.

151
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,540
There wouldn't have been any problems, you jerk.

152
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,040
- My goodness. - Gosh.

153
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:51,219
Sir. Leave.

154
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,190
- Leave when I'm asking nicely. - Darn you.

155
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,159
Mark my words.

156
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,729
I'm going to make you pay for what you did.

157
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,700
I'm going to crush this supermarket.

158
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,030
I'll set this supermarket on fire and kill myself.

159
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,169
You just wait!

160
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,939
You lunatic!

161
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,710
(MS Mart)

162
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,539
Don't harm anyone.

163
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,939
Just like you said, don't you remember...

164
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,049
you almost died that day?

165
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,720
So he wasn't lying. Right?

166
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,260
- Take him. - Okay.

167
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,990
Calm down.

168
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,890
- I'll be back. Mark my words. - Let's go.

169
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,230
I'll kill you.

170
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,930
So it's true that you almost killed that man.

171
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
And it's also true...

172
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,600
that you caught a man you almost killed and insisted...

173
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,940
that he was the culprit. Right?

174
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,469
That was self-defence.

175
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,710
I'll investigate to see if it's true.

176
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,380
Before that, I need to ask you something.

177
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,050
Where were you and what were you doing...

178
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:56,479
during the estimated time of death...

179
00:09:56,749 --> 00:09:58,579
for Kwon Bo Yeon and Lee Kyung A?

180
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,600
Goodness. You're so big and scary.

181
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:12,199
Gosh.

182
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:14,669
You're back.

184
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,499
We called the owner.

185
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,039
- The owner will be here soon. - Okay.

186
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,979
Gosh. Why is that stalker bullying this poor puppy?

187
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,010
Come on, A Hee.

188
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,510
Did they handle Five Dollars?

189
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:28,819
Five Dollars?

190
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,719
I heard he was harassing people at the supermarket.

191
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,760
Hello?

192
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,659
Detective Choi did what?

193
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,229
Did you know?

194
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:51,439
Did you know that Dae Sung was the new suspect?

195
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,440
Gosh. Well,

196
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,640
I didn't believe it at first.

197
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,449
This stalker, Five Dollars, and Detective Choi.

198
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm going to kill all of them.

199
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,080

Goodness. That crazy girl. There she goes again.

203
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,330
This is delicious. Try it, honey.

204
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,240
- Hello. You're here. - Ta-Da.

205

206

Your products don't look as fresh as before.

207

At this rate, I won't be able to renew your contract.

208
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,250
Honey, what was that about the election for the chairwoman?

209
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,790
Was it next month?

210
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,590
I heard we might be getting a new chairwoman.

211
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,590
What?

212
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:44,519
Gosh.

213
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,130
Seriously.

214
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,629
- Ma'am. - Yes?

215
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:51,929
- There you are. - Yes.

216
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,640
- Dae Sung is handling the store. - Right.

217
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,039
There's a huge scene at the store because of your son.

218
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,540
What?

219
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,610
You seem to know personal information of the victims.

220
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,710
And the stalker bought items from your supermarket.

221
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,219
I found an electric scooter you often ride at the scene.

222
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,580
- Everyone has access to that. - More importantly,

223
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,190
we found your fingerprints...

224
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,260

What's this about?

230
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,609
I should ask you the same thing. What are you doing here?

231
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,850
I got a report that a cop is harassing an innocent man.

232
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,880
So I've been dispatched.

233
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,419
What's the point behind these questions?

234
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,949
As you can see, I'm questioning a murder suspect.

235
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,859
- Is there a problem? - Then you came to the wrong guy.

236
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,160
- What? - He's not the culprit.

237
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,729
Officer Do. If you meddle now, you will find yourself in trouble.

I wanted to see if high-elasticity pantyhose is...

254

- strong enough to kill a man... - What?

255

I work at the supermarket.

00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,380
After trying the Civil Service Exam for ten years,

302
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,109
you failed and you're helping your parents' business.

It must be tough. Do you feel wronged?

305
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,690
I don't live off them.

306
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,790
I'm on probation, and I paid the rent in advance.

307

You failed the exam...

308
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,330
and get no support from your family.

309
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,860

It's often the case...

311
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,370

320
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,789
approach police on purpose to get information...

321
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,200
and enjoy...

322
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,400
It's been 20 years since we met.

323
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,969
Wasn't she in elementary at the time?

324
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:32,609
Some paedophiles...

325
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,310
We've known each other for 20 years.

326
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,780
We've known each other even before that.

327
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:37,039
Even if we started dating after we became adults,

328
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
it's been over a decade.

329
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,350
She wasn't a police from the start,

330
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,510
and I didn't hit on her since middle school...

331
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,720
to kill somebody. Besides!

332
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,749
It was her who followed me around.

333
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,320
Why are you enraged?

334
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,190
I'm just saying some murderers are like that.

335
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,330
Why are you doing this to me?

336
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:01,969
I never liked you from the start.

337
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,869
- What? - You know...

338
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:09,109
neighbour personal information like the back of your hand.

339
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,240
How would they feel about it?

340
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,050
I wasn't trying to do something with it.

341
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,350
- I only wanted to help... - You know where they live.

342
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,150
Their date of birth, phone number, and what they like.

344
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,019
And all the tools used for stalking and murder...

345
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,490
can be bought from your supermarket.

346
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,160
Everything fits perfectly.

347
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,669
In fact, I can't believe the probability.

348
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,370
Of what?

349
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,740
That I'm jobless?

350
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,910
That I was nice to the customers? Gosh.

351
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,540
You should be going after the culprit, not breaking...

352
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,680
the heart of an innocent person.

353
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,050
Did dead women break your heart?

354
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,260
Or were they obnoxious?

355
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,490
If I kill someone because they are obnoxious,

356
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,659
one third of people in the whole country will die.

357
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:03,059
You would've been dead already.

358
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,600
It must be easy for you to say...

359
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:10,599
because you're experienced.

360
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,649

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,890
What are you doing here, Ms. Han?

363
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,660

546
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:31,407
I found evidence.

547
00:29:40,858 --> 00:29:41,988
Oh, gosh.

548
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:50,267
Her top. Fish had the exact same top at home.

549
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:53,798
This can't be the only one ever sold.

550
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:56,637
Why did you break in in the first place?

551
00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:58,008
I didn't tell you but Kwon Bo Yeon...

552
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:01,477
was killed with nude-coloured high-elasticity pantyhose.

553
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:03,007
Fish had bought them.

554
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:05,707
So did I. Nude-coloured.

555
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:07,017
Fish is a guy.

556
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:08,878
And he lives alone.

557
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:11,018
Someone he knows must've needed a pair.

558
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:13,588
Don't be shocked.

559
00:30:15,257 --> 00:30:16,757
A Hee and I saw him...

560
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:19,897
dress like a woman and go out.

561
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:22,127
Darn you. What's wrong with that?

562
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:24,797
Cross-dressing could be his thing.

563
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:26,537
It's nothing to be mocked for.

564
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,338
Why are you so open-minded?

565
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,868
Even if it turns out to be the victim's clothing,

566
00:30:30,868 --> 00:30:32,568
we can't use it as evidence...

567
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:34,237
because you found it under illegal circumstances.

568
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:39,077
Was Fish hired after the stalking incidents occurred?

569
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:41,617
- Yes. - The timeline doesn't match.

570
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:45,818
A Hee, you're so smart.

571
00:30:45,817 --> 00:30:46,887
I have...

572
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:51,927
a list of people who bought what Lee Kyung A found in her bag.

573
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:54,958
After that, at the scene, they found plastic bags...

574
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:57,598
with the MS sticker, not the old Daesung Mart bags.

575
00:30:57,668 --> 00:31:00,368
Let's identify who bought the items that were found...

576
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:03,338
at the scene after we put on the MS stickers.

577
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:08,308
(Son Choon Seob, Nunchuck)

578
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:10,307
(Five Dollars)

579
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:11,307
(Jo, Seo, Kim, Lee)

580
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:13,247
(Seo Cheon Kyu)

581
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:14,877
(Canned peaches, can opener, soju)

582
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:18,548
(Canned peaches, can opener)

583
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:19,587
(Canned peaches, can opener)

584
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:20,588
(Five Dollars)

585
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:26,157
First, like Dae Sung said, we should check the people in the store.

586
00:31:27,027 --> 00:31:30,097
Why? Why do you think so, A Hee?

587
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:33,198
It's important to catch the killer, but we must also save the store.

588
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:37,468
To do that, we must prove that the store is unrelated to the case.

589
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,607
Let's take the innocent off the list.

590
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:41,408
Yes, you're right.

591
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:43,008
Let's see.

592
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:45,377
Meat and Products?

593
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:48,418
There's no way its Products.

594
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:51,348
I've known her for years. That's impossible.

595
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:54,157
She's not that kind of person.

596
00:31:54,158 --> 00:31:55,458
And Meat is?

597
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:57,488
Meat?

598
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:00,857
Not really.

599
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:02,358
You can't trust anyone.

600
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:05,267
When heinous criminals are arrested, people always say,

601
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:07,398
"He was so quiet."

602
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:08,798
"I didn't even think it would be him."

603
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:10,637
"Everyone said he was nice."

604
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:11,868
"He was such a good son."

605
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:13,537
That's what people say.

606
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:16,808
Even if we know them well, we must still check them out.

607
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:20,078
Then what about me? You don't have to check me out?

608
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:24,317
Fine.

609
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:26,657
Let's do what you say.

610
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:30,788
We should check on Meat and Products.

611
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:32,428
What about Fish?

612
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,328
I'll keep an eye on him with the captain.

613
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,697
(Geumsung Realty)

614
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,378
Products has been leaving cosmetic products...

615
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,318
and health supplements at Geumsung Realty every morning.

616
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:58,588
- What about that? - She's setting things up.

617
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:00,188
For what?

618
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,188
You see,

619
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:03,058
it's her wish...

620
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:05,627
to buy a house in this neighbourhood under her son's name.

621
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:06,857
She said...

622
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:09,058
she needed him to have a house to get married and stuff.

623
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,397
It's not like the wedding is tomorrow.

624
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,068
I don't get why she's making such a fuss.

625
00:33:12,668 --> 00:33:13,668
What about that?

626
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:15,138
Listen.

627
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,437
There are two murder victims.

628
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:19,008
Their houses must be on the market.

629
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:22,307
This must be her chance to make a purchase.

630
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:24,648
You do have a point.

631
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:26,377
That's enough motive to kill someone.

632
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:28,518
Gosh. No way. She wouldn't kill them over houses.

633
00:33:28,517 --> 00:33:31,717
- Gosh. You're so dense. - Hello. It's been a while.

634
00:33:32,118 --> 00:33:33,688
She didn't kill them...

635
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,417
to lower the property value.

636
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:39,557
She could be using the drop in the value to her advantage.

637
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,298
- She wouldn't kill people. - Ma'am.

638
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:44,197
You can't know that for sure.

639
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:45,767
She's been selling cosmetics...

640
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,898
in this old neighbourhood from door to door for 15 years.

641
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:50,507
She knows everything that goes on including the rumours.

642
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:52,037
She knows what's up with every family,

643
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:54,608
who's living alone, and who rarely has visitors at home.

644
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:56,177
She knows everything about them.

645
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:59,178
Since she sells health supplements too,

646
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:01,578
she knows all the security and maintenance offices...

647
00:34:01,578 --> 00:34:03,048
at every apartment.

648
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:04,317
So she can easily get through security...

649
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:06,357
and knows what's going on with every unit.

650
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:18,167
I see. That family hasn't moved out yet.

651
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:20,898
By the way, the upstairs unit is scared.

652
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:22,337
So they are moving out too.

653
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:26,777
Don't tell anyone yet.

654
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:29,207
Of course, not. And no one is asking.

655
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,808
You're the only one.

656
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:40,517
Hello.

657
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:41,518
Hi.

658
00:34:42,857 --> 00:34:45,127
Does your wife like the cosmetics?

659
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:48,027
Why do you keep bringing me more? I feel bad.

660
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:50,467
Gosh, no need to feel bad. Come on, it's just us here.

661
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:52,328
"Us"?

662
00:34:52,328 --> 00:34:53,538
We're neighbours.

663
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:59,237
When we have good food, we share them.

664
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,337
And when there's good information,

665
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:05,177
we share it too.

666
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:10,518
Do you have eyes on a unit?

667
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:12,547
The 4th floor of Building 3 at Jinsong Apartment.

668
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:16,657
The unit of the first murder victim.

669
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:21,727
I'll pay you handsomely for your fee.

670
00:35:21,928 --> 00:35:24,198
Can we come up with a nice plan?

671
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:25,698
Okay.

672
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,807
Gosh. I do feel the chills from this place.

673
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:33,708
But still. The building was built in the 80s.

674
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,408
I'm sure this unit has seen a lot worse.

675
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,348
With that logic,

676
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:39,478
we're all living on top of graveyards.

677
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:47,117
I gave myself the chills.

678
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:54,958
Please help me out.

679
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:57,467
Gosh.

680
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:00,168
Why are you coming out of this apartment?

681
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:02,067
I'm taking a walk.

682
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:03,868
To exercise.

683
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:06,168
Why would you take a walk with Mr. Seo?

684
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:07,837
- Are you two dating? - Gosh.

685
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:09,647
Why would you say that?

686
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:11,978
I'll leave you two to talk. Excuse me.

687
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:19,858
You can't do this.

688
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:22,058
You need to play fair.

689
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:24,188
Goodness, ma'am. You're getting old.

690
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:25,587
Don't you get tired?

691
00:36:25,788 --> 00:36:28,458
Gosh. Don't waste your energy on this.

692
00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:30,568
The majority has already decided.

693
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,567
I need to make an investment for the future.

694
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:34,298
What is decided?

695
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:35,498
Just watch.

696
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:38,207
I'll protect this neighbourhood at all costs.

697
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,578
Sure. Go ahead.

698
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:45,478
Seriously.

699
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,768
(MS Mart)

700
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:12,337
Are you bored?

701
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,537
Being tired is better than being bored.

702
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:17,677
Gosh. This is awful.

703
00:37:18,007 --> 00:37:20,517
Did you say you had to buy the stockings and tampons...

704
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,417
for your second-oldest sister?

705
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,147
No. They were for my third-oldest sister.

706
00:37:24,348 --> 00:37:26,458
She wears pads with wings.

707
00:37:26,987 --> 00:37:28,917
Well, I didn't want to know that.

708
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,758
I see. Now, I know.

709
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:33,398
What about the canned peaches?

710
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:35,297
You don't order them while drinking because you don't like them.

711
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:37,367
My father had dental implants for all of his teeth.

712
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:39,398
He likes them because they are soft.

713
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:41,797
What are you doing?

714
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:44,337
Are you suspecting me? Because of that list?

715
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:46,407
Gosh, no! What are you talking about?

716
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:49,878
I had to go over each item because of our sales.

717
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:51,347
You've been buying them regularly. So I was just curious.

718
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,478
Really?

719
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:54,918
But come to think of it, it doesn't feel nice.

720
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,718
You know everything I bought.

721
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,917
Are you keeping a secret from me? A secret between us?

722
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:01,557
Like who doesn't have a secret?

723
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:03,658
Everyone has one.

724
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:07,228
Is that why you kept it from me? That you like her.

725

(Napa cabbage)

726
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:14,198
Hey, I know what the heart wants. But you can't like her.

727
00:38:14,998 --> 00:38:16,468
It's not illegal.

728
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,367
But it's not ethical.

729
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,438
Hey, stop it.

730
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:22,037
I know we're friends, but don't cross the line.

731
00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:30,817
Whatever will be, will be

732
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,618
Wave your hands

733
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:37,958
- And say goodbye - Bye.

734
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:43,057

It's not the end, but a beginning Say hello to a new start

736
00:38:48,998 --> 00:38:50,168
Hello!

737
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,978
So cool! You're the best!

738
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:57,848
Ms. Han. Isn't he really cool?

739
00:38:58,448 --> 00:38:59,508
He's not just cool.

740
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:00,617
He's cool and sexy.

741
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:02,078
That's why I married him.

742
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:06,048
What a surprise. Why are you helping me?

743
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:07,157
What about the supermarket?

744
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,618
We make more money here than at the supermarket.

745
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:14,858
Should we tell Dae Sung to stop coming to work?

746
00:39:14,857 --> 00:39:16,627
He didn't do anything wrong!

747
00:39:16,627 --> 00:39:18,867
This is going to hurt his feelings.

748
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:20,738
Exactly.

749
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:22,697
It's that weird rumour to blame.

750
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:26,708
Sir, did you hear any rumours when you were working here?

751
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:29,778
Not really.

752
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:35,717
Right. Honey. I think we will indeed get a new chairwoman this time.

753
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:37,518
What?

754
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:38,618
Goodness.

755
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:40,558
What about the chairwoman?

756
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:44,688
Yang Soon hasn't been on good terms with the redevelopment committee.

757
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:45,887
She's against redevelopment.

758
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:49,458
Seriously? "Yang Soon"?

759
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:51,528
Go on.

760
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:54,567
From what I heard, Yang Soon...

761
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:59,137
Ms. Chairwoman has been delaying the project...

762
00:39:59,408 --> 00:40:01,678
while forming the ECSC behind their backs.

763
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:03,208
The ECSC?

764
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:07,378
Yes. The Exclusive Contractor Selection Committee.

765
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:10,287
Goodness. Unbelievable.

766
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:12,088
The redevelopment committee...

767
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:14,387
wants to have a consortium with many agencies.

768
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:16,488
But she wants to get rid of the committee representative,

769
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:17,887
so she gets her way.

770
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:21,228
Right. A lot of money is riding on that project.

771
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:24,398
- Anyway, she's something else too. - Right.

772
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:26,897
Honey. Isn't Products busy these days?

773
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:28,767
What? Why do you say that?

774
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:31,508
She's the key member of the redevelopment committee.

775
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:32,967
People have been divided into two groups.

776
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,237
Products' followers...

777
00:40:34,237 --> 00:40:36,107
and people who want to re-elect Ms. Chairwoman.

778
00:40:37,578 --> 00:40:38,678
Products?

779
00:40:38,678 --> 00:40:41,978
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman is just waiting for a chance to bring her down.

780
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:43,348
Products has been checking out houses...

781
00:40:43,348 --> 00:40:46,418
and spreading the news about the murder to lower the price.

782
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:50,387
From what I heard, she has a pile of cash at home.

783
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:52,757
She wants to buy all these units,

784
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,457
so she can have more property.

785
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,058
Things are crazy these days.

786
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:58,368
The motive is clearer than I thought.

787
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,938
Products is super greedy.

788
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:03,337
But she wouldn't kill people just to buy houses on the cheap.

789
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,867
Even if she buys the houses, she won't make a big profit...

790
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,208
from a bad real estate market.

791
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,008
Dae Sung. Do you remember...

792
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,777
every single neighbourhood that had murder cases?

793
00:41:11,147 --> 00:41:12,947
If there were murder cases around your workplace,

794
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:14,278
would you move out?

795
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,818
Some people are saying...

796
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:23,017
she even reported the murder cases to a TV station.

797
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:24,928
A lot of murders are committed by stalkers,

798
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:26,698
so the case wasn't published on the mainstream platform.

799
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:28,298
But still. It must be because of the redevelopment project.

800
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:29,967
It can't be about the murder.

801
00:41:31,428 --> 00:41:32,528
I still think...

802
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,068
Any news on Fish?

803
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:38,337
No. Nothing new.

804
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:41,507
Ms. Kwon Bo Yeon was murdered before he joined our supermarket.

805
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:44,778
I don't know exactly when he moved into our neighbourhood.

806
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:47,747
It's been two months since he moved in.

807
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:49,248
It's been two months.

808
00:41:49,848 --> 00:41:50,948
Then the timeline checks out.

809
00:41:52,317 --> 00:41:53,417
I'll call you back.

810
00:41:56,257 --> 00:41:58,857
I saw him when he signed the lease in my dad's office.

811
00:41:58,857 --> 00:41:59,857
Thanks.

812
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:05,098
Why did you ask about Sung Yoon?

813
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:08,068
Why do you call him by his name when you call me mister?

814
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:10,937
Right. That's up to you.

815
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,438
You like veggies for a kid.

816
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:18,077
I'm not buying veggies to eat.

817
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,908
Is it for homework? Do you have to make something with it?

818
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:22,047
There's a use for it.

819
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:25,747

Yes. But I saw...

843
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,217
the power was on.

844
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:11,157

931
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:36,165
Will you leave the store to me?

932
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:39,196
- What? - Why is no one ever here?

933
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:40,665
I'm only one person.

934
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:44,835
Should I let the customers in one by one?

935
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,875
I thought all would be fine now that people are coming back.

Am I the only one who cares?

937

I'll pay you the same even if we have fewer customers.

939
00:51:56,186 --> 00:51:59,516
I wonder why I work so hard for you.

940
00:52:00,456 --> 00:52:02,886
We just lost another customer looking at the fish.

941
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:05,725
What? Fish isn't back yet?

942
00:52:05,726 --> 00:52:07,026

No, she should be at home. Is something wrong?

No. Did Yul do something wrong?

00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:21,546
No, but...

950
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:23,606
She could be in danger.

951
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:25,375
What? Why would she be in danger?

952
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:29,845
I think she witnessed the murder.

953
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,256
- If the killer finds... - Did she say so?

954
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:34,985
No. She didn't say so but...

955
00:52:35,826 --> 00:52:36,826

Do you know where she hides when she's scared?

What a stupid thing to ask.

1021
00:57:21,246 --> 00:57:22,606
There's no way you're okay.

The tampons.

1042
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:27,305
She asked me to get them because she was too scared to come.

1043
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:38,756
She was my only friend here.

1044
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,486
She knew what I was...

1045
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:45,155
