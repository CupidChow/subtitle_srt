00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:38,932
(The drama was shot in the presence of the child actress' guardian.)

2
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:42,102
Hello.

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,750
I won't tell anyone about what I saw.

4
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:02,323
Don't kill me. Please don't!

5
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,653
Save me!

6
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,183
- Thank you. - Bye.

7
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:48,003
- What? - I want a chewy snack!

8
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,003
A chewy snack?

9
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,163
- Aren't you full? - Get me a chewy snack!

10
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:52,603
- She should do an eating show. - Okay, I'll get some.

11
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,573
Fatty's the best!

12
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,282
Dae Sung.

13
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:24,262
Oh, my gosh.

14
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,273
Goodness.

15
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:31,273
What's this smell?

16
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:34,212
Hey.

17
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:36,142
What?

18
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:41,753
What is this?

19
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:57,463
Chewy snacks!

20
00:02:58,832 --> 00:02:59,932
Chewy snacks!

21
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,173
It's cold. Why not go inside?

22
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,202
- What flavor is it? - Sweet potato.

23
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:06,112
It's just 384 calories.

24
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:08,813
That sounds good!

25
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:17,152
Ready, go!

26
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:33,233
There was no surprise!

27
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:34,642
The MS Mart champion...

28
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:37,442
Part Timer defends her championship!

29
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:39,913
What do you eat?

30
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:42,313
Why even take her on? Didn't you see her at work?

31
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:46,183
I'll get going, then.

32
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,253
The loser does the dishes.

33
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:50,783
I'll see you all tomorrow.

34
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,293
- No, wait. - See you!

35
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:54,352
- Bye! - Must I clean up all...

36
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:58,762
Here. Chew on this as you walk home.

37
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:00,832
Somebody has to clean up.

38
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:04,432
Do you not see where this is going? Get a hint.

39
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:07,272
Get going. I'll clean up tomorrow.

40
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:08,272
Okay.

41
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:15,042
- Bye. - Take me shopping next time.

42
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:17,012
Okay. Let's go shopping.

43
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:19,712
Take care.

44
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,022
You should go too. I'll walk you.

45
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,423
What? I'm going to stay the night.

46
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:27,593
Your mother said I could.

47
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:38,032
(Episode 6)

48
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,433
What are you doing?

49
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,003
- I don't want to go. - Go.

50
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,543
- I won't go home. - You will.

51
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:48,613
No. I want to stay here.

52
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,182
No.

53
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,682
- Dae Sung. - Yes?

54
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:56,022
Carry me.

55
00:04:57,053 --> 00:04:58,053
Now?

56
00:04:58,222 --> 00:04:59,222
Yes.

57
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,022
What...

58
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:07,933
What's going on?

59
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,132
Did something else happen?

60
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:11,573
Don't...

61
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:14,942
It's an ambulance, not a police car.

62
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,873
I have to go. I'm a police officer.

63
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,073
It's not your shift!

64
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:20,812
You can't go, not this drunk.

65
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,213
I'm not drunk!

66
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:25,413
You are drunk if you're running after a siren!

67
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:29,252
How could they do something like that?

68
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:32,053
I don't even want to talk about it.

69
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,963
I was terrified.

70
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:35,962
My goodness...

71
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:39,962
- Detective Kim. - Yes, hi.

72
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:42,002
- You found her? - Yes, I did.

73
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:43,063
Just a moment.

74
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,282
What? Say that again.

75
00:05:58,152 --> 00:05:59,152
What?

76
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:12,692
Ms. Chairwoman.

77
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:19,502
Glue...

78
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,142
Okay. That's fine.

79
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:35,852
Let's go.

80
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:38,492
- How did you know? - The siren.

81
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:40,453
I can tell you've been drinking.

82
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:44,793
I found this on the fourth floor.

83
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:47,333
My guess is the culprit probably used this...

84
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:48,932
on the victim's eyes and mouth.

85
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:55,172
Glue...

86
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,773
Was she trying to say "glue gun"?

87
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:01,643
They started inspecting the scene. You should go and see it.

88
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:04,783
Let's go.

89
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:10,383
- Right. - Goodness.

90
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:13,523
- I have never seen anything... - Calm down.

91
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:16,162
- that awful in my life. - Ma'am.

92
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:18,092
Did the victim ever say someone held a grudge against her...

93
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,132
- What? - or talk about her problems?

94
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,203
Everyone has a couple of people who hold grudges against...

95
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:26,472
How would I know?

96
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,743
Enough with the bells. Come on.

97
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:37,112
No one lives there. Stop ringing the bell.

98
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:40,182
Oh, dear.

99
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:44,482
Of all people, you live here.

100
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:48,192
What about it? Why can't I live here?

101
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:50,993
Are you saying I did it?

102
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:52,462
Do what?

103
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:56,033
Gosh. No.

104
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:57,533
No, go ahead.

105
00:07:57,803 --> 00:07:59,573
Once I investigate, I'll find out everything.

106
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:03,942
I can prove to you that I didn't do it.

107
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,002
(Chocolate Pie)

108
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:35,903
(Chocolate Pie)

109
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:42,612
(Samyu Peaches)

110
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:29,693
It was you!

111
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:33,363
Are you going to push me off the rooftop too? Darn it.

112
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,063
Have you gone mad?

113
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,903
I was going to...

114
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:41,972
Come on. Hey, what's wrong with you?

115
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:43,773
Did you have a nightmare?

116
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:45,312
You were screaming, so I came in to check up on you...

117
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:46,643
in case you were having sleep paralysis.

118
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,783
Come on. What's this?

119
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:52,953
It's way too early in the morning to deal with your madness!

120
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:56,122
No. I'm the crazy one.

121
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:58,723
I woke up early to fix your door. Look what you did.

122
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:00,693
Gosh.

123
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,572
Why did you fix this...

124
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:16,142
early in the morning without telling me?

125
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:19,743
Thank me if you are grateful. And apologize if you feel bad.

126
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:22,512
Once I saw it, I had to fix it. I knew you would never fix it.

127
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:25,252
The weather is getting colder now. How could I not think about that?

128
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:27,752
Did you clean this up?

129
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:31,283
Then did a fairy come out and clean the mess here?

130
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:33,853
Why didn't you come last night? You didn't answer your phone either.

131
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:37,963
I just wasn't in a good mood.

132
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,392
I wasn't feeling well either.

133
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:41,733
Did Fish just leave without cleaning it up?

134
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:42,832
After eating all that food?

135
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,433
You told him you would do it, right?

136
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,942
Then were you at home last night?

137
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:54,942
Yes. I was just...

138
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,213
Fine. I had drinks alone in front of my house.

139
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:00,252
Where?

140
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,552
What's up with the questions?

141
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,123
You think I had some delicious food without you?

142
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:08,862
Nothing. Actually, the meat you gave us was delicious.

143
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:10,392
Hey, you were having a party.

144
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:12,163
Of course, I would give you the best stuff.

145
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,593
Pay up later.

146
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:16,802
I thought you were buying.

147
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:18,732
You said it was on you.

148
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,503
How could you really give us ribeye just because I asked for ribeye?

149
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,043
It was like a figure of speech.

150
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:24,572
Pork belly...

151
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:26,672
How could everyone be so inconsiderate?

152
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:28,172
Wash up already.

153
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,612
It's time to go to work.

154
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:36,152
(The best discount store around)

155
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:45,932
Hey, I just need a moment of your time.

156
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,233
It won't take long.

157
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:57,742
(Specializes in Korean beef)

158
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:00,372
How many text messages is he sending her?

159
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:02,613
No idea.

160
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,013
Is something wrong?

161
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,782
Is it because Veggie quit?

162
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,022
He didn't come to the party last night.

163
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,963
- Did you call Veggie? - No.

164
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:18,863
Why?

165
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:20,892
She's so scared that she won't even come to work.

166
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,433
Aren't you worried about her?

167
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,172
It's not like my call will stop her from feeling scared.

168
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,202
- No. - Why are you worrying about her?

169
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:28,872
All of us are in danger now.

170
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:31,242
There are so many crime cases in our neighborhood.

171
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:33,712
What?

172
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:35,913
What happened?

173
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:40,652
Ms. Chairwoman fell off the apartment building last night.

174
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:42,683
- What? - She did.

175
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:44,982
What...

176
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:47,193
Was it suicide?

177
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,522
Hey.

178
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:51,663
I don't think so.

179
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:53,863
How do you know that?

180
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:56,132
I saw her eyes!

181
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:57,162
What? Gosh.

182
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,902
I couldn't bear to look at her.

183
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:01,533
It was like...

184
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,143
someone had seared her eyes and mouth with something.

185
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:10,182
Then did someone push her off the building on purpose?

186
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,213
- To kill her? - Hey. Come on.

187
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:15,422
Who knows?

188
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:19,923
I couldn't get any sleep last night because I had bad dreams.

189
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,852
I don't have any appetite either.

190
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:24,192
Hey.

191
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:28,492
(Cherry tomatoes, tomatoes, pomegranates, apples, persimmons)

192
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:29,632
It's sweet.

193
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:32,833
Gosh. I can't do this.

194
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:38,243
(Veggie)

195
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,572
(Veggie)

196
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:42,283
(MS Mart)

197
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:59,733
(Meat)

198
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:13,573
Who is it?

199
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:17,283
Who is it?

200
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:19,383
It's me.

201
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:21,312
Ms. Han?

202
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:33,893
Hello.

203
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,532
You're okay. Right?

204
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:38,102
Yes.

205
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,673
Here.

206
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:44,602
I thought you wouldn't feel safe to come out to buy groceries.

207
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:47,542
So I just brought you some basic stuff you would need.

208
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,743
Thank you.

209
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:53,812
I thought you were going to stay somewhere else.

210
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:55,623
What are you doing at home all alone?

211
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,623
Things haven't been exactly easy on me.

212
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:04,423
If you need anything for the time being,

213
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:08,233
feel free to call me. You can call me even at late night.

214
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:10,203
Even if I can't find them at my supermarket,

215
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,962
I'll buy them for you.

216
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,103
Dae Sung and Part Timer are helping out too.

217
00:15:15,102 --> 00:15:17,172
No. I feel awful.

218
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,843
Everyone must be busy after I quit.

219
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:21,872
Gosh. Don't worry about that.

220
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:26,212
And don't open the door easily even if you know them.

221
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:28,383
Make sure to lock up.

222
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:29,952
Don't forget the safety chain.

223
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:33,023
Make sure to hook the chain. Okay?

224
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:35,223
Why?

225
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,323
Was there another incident?

226
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,093
Who is it? Someone we know?

227
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,633
Gosh.

228
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:44,963
(Meat)

229
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:48,803
No. I just wanted to make sure you stayed safe.

230
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,503
You should be careful.

231
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:53,013
Okay.

232
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:55,742
If there's anything, call me. Okay?

233
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:57,283
Okay.

234
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:58,682
What about your husband?

235
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:00,452
When is he coming back from the Philippines?

236
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,522
He has to stay there a bit longer.

237
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:08,292
Gosh. Why now of all times?

238
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:13,762
Thank you, boss.

239
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,433
I should invite you in for a cup of tea,

240
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,733
but my house is a mess.

241
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,833
No. I should go.

242
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:22,542
Then I'll see you later.

243
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,742
Bye. Thank you.

244
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:34,783
No.

245
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,552
Let's meet somewhere other than my house.

246
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:39,652
With lots of crowds.

247
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:44,362
(CCTV in operation)

248
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,933
I got it.

249
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,733
That was close.

250
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:51,862
You like koalas, don't you?

251
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:53,832
I'll get it for you.

252
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:03,813
I got it.

253
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:07,512
Darn it.

254
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,082
Do you want to try?

255
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:12,892
Come here. I know you like it.

256
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,993
Is that my dad's new toy?

257
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:18,193
Mom said she was going to get a refund yesterday.

258
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,233
They actually got into an argument yesterday.

259
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:22,333
But you know what Mr. Kim is like.

260
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:23,663
Boss lost.

261
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:24,903
Where's Mom?

262
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:26,073
She's probably out in the market.

263
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,973
People are boycotting because of Mr. An.

264
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,782
Dae Sung. You need to come with me.

265
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:41,813
Why?

266
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,453
You were at Cho Yang Soon's crime scene yesterday, weren't you?

267
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,252
Because Officer Do was drunk...

268
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:50,923
She always runs that way when she hears the siren.

269
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:54,262
You were there at the estimated time of crime.

270
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:57,902
Yes. I was on delivery to Building 1 Unit 211.

271
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,443
You can check or call them if you want.

272
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:04,972
(Jinsong Apartment Building 1 Unit 211)

273
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:07,043
The time of delivery is on the receipt.

274
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:09,213
Before that, I had dinner on the rooftop.

275
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,513
You can ask them.

276
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,753
You might have run into her while on delivery...

277
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:17,823
and didn't miss your chance.

278
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,852
- You also had an alibi. - What chance?

279
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:21,422
A chance to kill Cho Yang Soon.

280
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:24,862
That doesn't make any sense.

281
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:27,992
If I was going to kill her, why would I glue her mouth and eyes?

282
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:29,703
I'd rather make it look like a fall.

283
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:31,102
He's right.

284
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:38,102
I don't think one planned to kill her just by pushing her off.

285
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,612
Though she's in a coma, she still survived.

286
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:42,682
If one tried to make it look like a fall,

287
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,812
one wouldn't have done that like you said.

288
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,612
Whether one did that to her face as a joke or a threat,

289
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:51,452
it'd make sense to desert the body after the murder.

290
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:54,153
While you were on delivery,

291
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:56,292
you ran into Cho Yang Soon who happened to visit the building...

292
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:58,523
by chance.

293
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,162
You two had a fight before.

294
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:05,463
- But I wouldn't... - You got into an argument again,

295
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:07,333
so you threatened her...

296
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:08,732
and tried to kill her,

297
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,103
but she got away...

298
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:14,573
and fell off because she couldn't see.

299
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:17,783
So you're saying,

300
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:20,482
I carry a glue gun with me...

301
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:22,483
and get into an argument with the person I met by chance.

302
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:25,022
Then I burn her with the glue gun in the apartment hallway,

303
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:27,653
and she fell off while running away and fell into a coma?

304
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:31,262
Why do you have to be so absurd?

305
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:34,763
He's right. Why are you doing that?

306
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:37,402
I'm not being absurd. I... Ouch.

307
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,402
Watch where you're going.

308
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:40,373
Get out of the way.

309
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:43,042
Don't stand in front of the checkout.

310
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:46,713
(MS Mart)

311
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:50,213
Gosh.

312
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:52,713
Today's fish look good today. Do you want any?

313
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:55,412
No thanks.

314
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:56,822
They're high quality.

315
00:19:57,723 --> 00:19:58,723
That's a bummer.

316
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:01,592
Fish, my foot.

317
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:06,192
Look. I think my son explained enough,

318
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:07,362
don't you agree?

319
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:13,603
This isn't going to solve the problem.

320
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:16,072
There's a witness.

321
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:22,343
A witness for something he didn't do?

322
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,612
That witness must be the culprit then.

323
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:26,282
Who said that?

324
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:27,683
I can't tell you.

325
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,223
You need to come with me because of the report.

326
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:31,723
You need to write a statement,

327
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:34,093
and I need to compare it with the witness' statement.

328
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:35,152
What are you doing?

329
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:36,792
Watch the checkout.

330
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,063
I'll be right back.

331
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:39,562
Dae Sung.

332
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:41,632
Dae Sung.

333
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:43,662
Are you okay?

334
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,073
Sorry.

336
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:57,442
Aren't you following him today?

337
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:59,882
No need to. He's innocent. He'll be out soon.

338
00:20:59,882 --> 00:21:01,212
He has an alibi.

339
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:03,483
What's gotten into you?

340
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:05,053
My goodness.

341
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:07,423
I will catch the culprit...

342
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:09,722
when Detective Choi is wasting his time.

343
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:12,493
That way, he'll stop bothering my Dae Sung.

344
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,832
Do you have any guesses?

345
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:19,303
No.

346
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:23,872
Why are there so many stalkers in this town lately?

347
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,642
There has always been a lot.

348
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,543
You just never know who the stalker is.

349
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:32,013
It started as stalking and led to a murder,

350
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:34,183
so I'm going to beat them up first.

351
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:35,582
Beat who up?

352
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:37,222
There's the guy who abandoned Meonji.

353
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:40,253
And the guy who intruded into Veggie's house is a strong suspect.

354
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:43,292
It's a war against stalkers now.

355
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,563
Sure.

356
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:47,733
But you still need to get your job done.

00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:24,963
It's suspicious that it occurred...

369
00:22:24,963 --> 00:22:26,833
when Meat didn't join dinner last night.

370
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,672
There are so many suspicious people,

371
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:33,172
but why does he only pick on Dae Sung?

372
00:22:33,672 --> 00:22:36,342
I'm going to make Detective Choi resign.

373
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:39,882
I'm going to destroy him completely.

374
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:47,894

Oh, right.

384
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:28,381
Something came up.

385
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,280
I'll be right back.

00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:42,791
Do you have worries?

390
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,270
You want to talk to me?

391
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Dad told me to watch out for a kind adult man.

392
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,240
But we had fun together on the claw machine.

393
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,811
Do you want to give me advice...

394
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:56,441
or play with me?

395
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
What?

396
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:02,751
You sound just like Dae Sung when he was young.

397
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,181
You're so smart.

398
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,820

399
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,690
No. Yul. Wait.

400
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:17,161
I'm sorry. I didn't think I grabbed you that hard.

401
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,930
Did it hurt a lot?

402
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,700
Let me see.

403
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,871
What's wrong with your arm?

404
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
Did you put ointment on?

405
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,640
- It's nothing. - It's not nothing.

406

Yes.

Last night, Meat didn't join us for dinner.

It bothers me that this happened at around that time.

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,990
I think we should watch him.

Oh, dear. Silly me.

487
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,460

I'll call you back.

Don't you worry.

490
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:05,741
Wait just 30 minutes.

491

But the thing is...

492
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:10,581
Do we have to talk for that long?

493
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:12,421
No, it's not that.

494
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,851

495
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,850
What?

They want 30 portions of bite-sized pork cutlet.

497
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,630
They have to be well-hammered.

498
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:26,001
You know how you hammer the meat to tenderize it.

499
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:29,671
- When do they need it? - Oh, dear.

500
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:33,001
They want it delivered in an hour.

They're throwing a party today.

Business is slow these days,

503
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:39,511
and they're a valued customer.

504
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,711
If we were to lose their trust,

505
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,420
would that be good or bad?

00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,050
Bad.

00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:50,321
twenty portions in the back.

509

510
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,361
you have just enough time.

511
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:57,261

512
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,430

Fish.

515
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,210
We must talk.

Yes.

It's a lie.

541
00:32:49,211 --> 00:32:52,281
It's not. I told you.

542

On my way back,

543
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,320
I hid and saw him.

544
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,490
So yesterday, there's something...

545
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,190
I learned, it's new information.

546
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:09,861
The glue gun.

547
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,000
Look into that.

548
00:33:13,331 --> 00:33:16,471
This punk was wearing gloves...

549
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:19,201
so there might not be his prints,

550
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:22,171
but my prints will definitely be on it.

551
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,980
What do you mean?

552
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:27,851
What I'm saying is, yesterday...

553
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,730
After you guys left,

554
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:51,301
I looked into the tool box...

555
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,340
at the entrance near my doorway.

00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,820
The glue gun. It was gone.

557
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,520
I think he took it...

558
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:10,261
and did what he did.

559
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,120
He lost his mind,

560
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,290
looked for something to kill with,

561
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,931
and saw the glue gun and used that.

562
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,540
Did you see a tool box yesterday?

563
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:27,641
I didn't.

564
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:29,271
I didn't, either.

565
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:34,581
What? Well, I guess you could've missed it.

566
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:35,751
You could have.

567
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:39,021
You could have missed it when it was right there.

568
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,220
Mr. An, we're done with you, so you can go home.

569
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,031
I can go? Can I really go?

570
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,160
Yes, but don't go far.

571
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:52,561
You must always be reachable since it's not over yet.

572
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:56,370
- And me? - You and I need to start over.

00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,871

00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:03,171
Why should I...

576
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,211
- I just... - Come on.

577
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:07,451
I'll kill you.

578
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,210
You go on your way.

579
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:12,381
He just hit me!

580
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,590
Wait. Why...

581
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,590
Why did you let him go? Why are you keeping me here?

582
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,560

00:36:05,742 --> 00:36:06,742
Hey.

588
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,743
You'll go dressed like that?

I don't do a half-hearted job.

590
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:13,052
He won't recognize me.

591
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:15,223
But you...

592
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:19,423
What if other people find out?

593
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:20,693
If other people find out,

594
00:36:20,893 --> 00:36:22,293
will you fire me?

595
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:24,963
Gosh, no way.

596
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:26,193
I'm just worried...

597
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:28,662
that things might get tough for you.

598
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:31,102

To work here after that,

601
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:36,412
people will find out anyway.

602
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:40,442
Thank you so much.

603
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:42,213
You're risking a lot for me.

604
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:43,983

605
00:36:44,012 --> 00:36:45,012

Yes!

617

Wait. You want me to handle this big supermarket on my own?

- Yes. - With the same hourly rate?

So she can neither see you nor talk to you.

I'm just heartbroken about what happened to her.

You couldn't reach her family, right?

663
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:07,562
No. I heard that she had a daughter,

664
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,403
but there's no way to reach her.

665
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:12,032
She doesn't have her daughter's number either.

I knew that your husband beat you,

724

00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,023
You have a right to an attorney.

741
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,993
You have a chance to justify yourself.

742
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:39,033
Did he hit you?

743
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:42,003
You're also charged with assault.

744
00:48:42,563 --> 00:48:44,033
Your clothes, did he do that?

745
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:48,602
Also sexual violence and attempted murder.

746
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:50,442
In fact, you got caught in the act.

747
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:51,473
No.

748
00:48:51,472 --> 00:48:53,542
You already have a lot on your hands,

749
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:56,083
but you also violated the stalking law.

750
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:58,252
What do you mean by...

751
00:48:59,412 --> 00:49:02,382
- stalking? - You kept chasing her around.

752
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:04,893
You broke into her house before.

753
00:49:04,952 --> 00:49:05,952
Gosh.

754
00:49:05,952 --> 00:49:07,092
Did you kill Kyung A too?

755
00:49:08,193 --> 00:49:10,933
- Kyung A? - The woman who got killed recently.

756
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:12,593
With the peach can.

757
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:17,632
What the heck are you talking about?

758
00:49:18,632 --> 00:49:19,972
See it for yourself.

759
00:49:20,103 --> 00:49:22,243
It's in here, so see it for yourself!

760
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:28,012
I went to the Philippines for business.

761
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:29,613
I returned just the other day.

762
00:49:42,623 --> 00:49:44,663
Hey!

763
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:47,463
Let me go. I'll go on my own.

764
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:49,663
I said I'll go!

765
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:53,172
- What the heck are you looking at? - Cooperate with us.

766
00:49:53,432 --> 00:49:55,572
If you have anything to say, you can tell us at the station.

767
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:56,802
Gosh!

768
00:50:10,623 --> 00:50:13,393
(Police)

769
00:50:17,193 --> 00:50:19,893
What are you doing here?

770
00:50:20,092 --> 00:50:22,202
I was visiting my friend, then I saw you.

771
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:25,172
I know you're upset, but you shouldn't be in here.

772
00:50:25,173 --> 00:50:27,843
- Get up. - What's wrong with you?

773
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:30,572
Wish you the best. From the next chairwoman.

774
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:32,312
What are you doing? Seriously.

775
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:34,543
Let me go.

776
00:50:35,983 --> 00:50:37,613
Why is your friend in hospital?

777
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:39,252
- Appendix. - I see.

778
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:42,423
If he was any late, he could've been in big trouble.

779
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:43,553
Which friend?

780
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:45,222
You don't know all my friends.

781
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:46,492
Would you know if I tell you the name?

782
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:47,893
Do I have to?

783
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:50,222
You don't know him.

784
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:51,593
Fine.

785
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:54,162
Why are you so upset?

786
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:56,702
You're acting strange.

787
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:58,032
I'm not.

788
00:50:58,032 --> 00:50:59,402
It's strange that you're...

789
00:51:02,202 --> 00:51:03,672
Where's your friend?

790
00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:05,213
Is it around here?

791
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:08,842
I heard he's on this floor, but I have to ask the nurse.

792
00:51:09,512 --> 00:51:11,012
I kept asking him,

793
00:51:11,012 --> 00:51:13,682
but he won't tell me where he is.

794
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,452
Go ask the nurse.

795
00:51:17,722 --> 00:51:20,052
You should go.

796
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:21,323
I'll go see my friend.

797
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:28,562
Okay.

798
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:35,873
- Hello. - Hello.

799
00:51:37,813 --> 00:51:39,613
Can you tell me...

800
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:43,882
where Kim Woo Cheol is who had appendix surgery yesterday?

801
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:44,952
Who?

802
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:48,782
- Kim Cheol's room. - What?

803
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:51,592
Kim... Kim's...

804
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:52,852
Did you say appendix?

805
00:51:52,853 --> 00:51:54,363
Appendix patients aren't on this floor.

806
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,392
- Go downstairs and... - You see...

807
00:51:57,262 --> 00:52:00,092
let me ask you something since I'm here already.

808
00:52:00,092 --> 00:52:01,262
Yes, what is it?

809
00:52:01,262 --> 00:52:04,502
Is there a long stay patient...

810
00:52:04,632 --> 00:52:08,042
named Nguyen Thi Zhonglin? She's from Vietnam.

811
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:11,813
- Nguyen Thi Zhonglin? - Yes.

812
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:13,472
She has a child.

813
00:52:13,472 --> 00:52:16,112
She's around 35.

814
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:17,952
She came here often.

815
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,483
I don't know what her problem is exactly though.

816
00:52:20,753 --> 00:52:23,383
If she's hospitalized, she's probably here.

817
00:52:23,382 --> 00:52:26,422
But she just won't tell me where she is.

818
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:28,622
I'm sorry, but you should ask her guardian.

819
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,593
I can't give you her personal information.

820
00:52:30,592 --> 00:52:32,592
Can't you just tell me?

821
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:33,862
I came all the way here.

822
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:36,033
Look who it is.

823
00:52:36,162 --> 00:52:37,902
Yes. Hi.

824
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:40,372
Are you all right?

825
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:42,573
I'm here to visit someone.

826
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:45,442
If she's hospitalized, she's probably here.

827
00:52:45,443 --> 00:52:47,213
She won't tell me where she is.

828
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:48,943
She said she didn't want to bother me.

829
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,813
The nurse said she can't tell me.

830
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:53,912
She should.

831
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,923
What?

832
00:52:57,693 --> 00:53:00,223
Go home.

833
00:53:00,322 --> 00:53:01,462
Who are you looking for?

834
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:04,163
I know most of the people here if you tell me.

835
00:53:05,463 --> 00:53:07,663
Oh, you're right.

836
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,863
She's from Vietnam.

837
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:11,933
She married a realtor in this town.

838
00:53:11,932 --> 00:53:13,232
She has a daughter.

839
00:53:13,432 --> 00:53:15,702
Her name is Yul. Seo Yul.

840
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:17,512
- Yul's mom? - Stay out of it.

841
00:53:17,713 --> 00:53:19,573
Of course I know her.

842
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,312
Really? Where is she?

843
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:22,982
She's not in this hospital.

844
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:24,182
No?

845
00:53:24,353 --> 00:53:28,023
She sometimes came to the neighborhood foreigners' meetings.

846
00:53:28,023 --> 00:53:29,683
But she hasn't attended for a while.

847
00:53:29,682 --> 00:53:32,092
If she came to this hospital, I'd know.

848
00:53:33,153 --> 00:53:34,493
Is it a different hospital?

849
00:53:34,762 --> 00:53:37,262
What? Is she all right?

850
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:38,332
It's just...

851
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,533
No wonder she's sick with all that beating.

852
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:43,462
Beating? Who would beat her?

853
00:53:43,463 --> 00:53:44,703
Who else?

854
00:53:45,072 --> 00:53:46,502
Keep it down.

855
00:53:47,643 --> 00:53:50,743
It's common for brides from overseas to get beaten.

856
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:51,972
They just don't talk about it.

857
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:55,112
Ms. Caregiver?

858
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:57,483
- Bye. - Thanks.

859
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:01,853
How do you know that?

860
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:03,322
Why wouldn't I?

861
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,992
I visited her often when Yul was young.

862
00:54:06,492 --> 00:54:09,662
I haven't visited for a year now, but I can still tell.

863
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:13,833
The realtor bought some makeup for his wife,

864
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,403
but bought only concealers.

865
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:18,932
And lots of it, when his wife doesn't need any.

866
00:54:19,273 --> 00:54:20,273
Concealer?

867
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:22,543
To cover up the cuts and bruises.

868
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,612
Did you see him hit her?

869
00:54:24,612 --> 00:54:26,312
Or see her bruises?

870
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:28,883
Do you have to see to know?

871
00:54:28,983 --> 00:54:30,113
It's obvious at a glance.

872
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:34,283
You didn't care for her then.

873
00:54:34,822 --> 00:54:35,922
Why look for her now?

874
00:54:35,983 --> 00:54:39,453
I'm bothered that I haven't seen her around.

875
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:41,293
I hoped to...

876
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:43,892
see her face while I was here.

877
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:47,832
Did she flee to her home country?

878
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:50,632
Oh, great timing.

879
00:54:58,242 --> 00:54:59,242
Wait!

880
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:03,912
(Unheng Hospital)

881
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:13,353
What are you doing?

882
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:15,563
Thinking.

883
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:17,222
About what?

884
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:20,062
(Goodbye.)

885
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:23,133
Earlier today, Yul tried to buy something,

886
00:55:23,132 --> 00:55:26,372
but she paid and ran off leaving everything behind.

887
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:28,402
Should I take them to her or wait?

888
00:55:28,543 --> 00:55:30,873
Should I return the cash or goods?

889
00:55:31,043 --> 00:55:33,243
Yul? Why?

890
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:35,442
I lifted her sleeve...

891
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:36,943
and her arm was blistered.

892
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:39,113
They looked like burns.

893
00:55:40,052 --> 00:55:42,922
I went to get a cream for her, but she just ran off.

894
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:46,122
What's her dad doing, not treating it?

895
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:48,493
Give me what Yul bought.

896
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:51,433
It's in here.

897
00:55:53,193 --> 00:55:54,303
- Here. - Part Timer.

898
00:56:01,202 --> 00:56:05,912
(MS Mart)

899
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:18,852
(MS Mart)

900
00:56:18,952 --> 00:56:20,992
(Will be back shortly. Geumsung Realty)

901
00:56:23,822 --> 00:56:25,392
What are you doing here?

902
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:28,302
Where's your dad?

903
00:56:28,702 --> 00:56:29,702
I don't know.

904
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:32,933
Do you know the code?

905
00:56:33,673 --> 00:56:34,673
Why?

906
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:38,173
I don't want you to wait outside too long.

907
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:41,383
Dad will be back soon.

908
00:56:42,543 --> 00:56:44,513
He said he'd take me home.

909
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:48,022
Here you go.

910
00:56:50,052 --> 00:56:51,052
And your change.

911
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:54,052
What did the police say?

912
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:56,362
- Did you not go to prison? - What?

913
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:59,692
The detective thought you were the bad guy.

914
00:56:59,693 --> 00:57:01,363
No, he was mistaken.

915
00:57:01,802 --> 00:57:02,802
I know that.

916
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:04,403
Thanks...

917
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:10,103
- What? - I know you didn't do it.

918
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,952
How? How do you know that?

919
00:57:19,983 --> 00:57:22,753
Did you really see something that night?

920
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,032
It's okay, Yul. Nothing bad will happen.

921
00:57:34,862 --> 00:57:36,462
So tell me everything.

922
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,873
About what?

923
00:57:41,403 --> 00:57:42,743
These blisters.

924
00:57:45,373 --> 00:57:46,643
Did your dad cause them?

925
00:57:59,653 --> 00:58:01,063
Why are you bothering her?

926
00:58:10,262 --> 00:58:12,432
(The Killer's Shopping List)

927
00:58:33,253 --> 00:58:34,993
Products killed someone?

928
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:40,292
Hey. I really think it's not her.

929
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:42,903
Were you following me?

930
00:58:43,202 --> 00:58:44,402
We must start over.

931
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:45,932
Pull yourself together.

932
00:58:45,932 --> 00:58:48,172
Why did we suspect the store staff?

933
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:50,473
Because they bought the murder weapon...

934
00:58:50,472 --> 00:58:52,212
or items found at the crime scene.

935
00:58:52,213 --> 00:58:53,213
Correct.

936
00:58:54,273 --> 00:58:55,783
If he were the killer,

937
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:58,982
wouldn't it be best to stay at home knowing...

938
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:00,482
he can't do anything else?

939
00:59:01,452 --> 00:59:02,452
You...

940
00:59:03,322 --> 00:59:05,092
If you're in pain or afraid,

941
00:59:05,353 --> 00:59:06,953
just call.

942
00:59:08,722 --> 00:59:09,792
Let's catch him.

943
00:59:10,162 --> 00:59:11,432
We'll catch him.
