1
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:36,852
Who are you?

2
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,692
A Hee!

3
00:00:57,203 --> 00:00:58,203
Dae Sung!

00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:19,893
(Samyu Peaches)

6
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,823
Why should we look for someone even the police won't?

7
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:51,293
What if we suspect our customers, word gets out, and we go down?

8
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:55,233
Miss, take those and throw them away...

9
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,433
or do whatever you want.

10
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,963
Please, just leave. Leave.

11
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:00,333
Go home.

12
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:04,603
She...

13
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:07,372
She said she was scared and...

14
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,742
I sent her away.

15
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:13,012
I threw her out.

16
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:18,323
Is this the police?

17
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,123
I'm at...

18
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:23,122
Nadeuri Apartment Building 103 Unit 402.

19
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:24,562
Yes.

20
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:25,563
(Samyu Peaches)

21
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,463
Dae Sung. Don't do it.

22
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,402
You don't have to.

23
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,033
Yes. Don't do it. Just don't.

24
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:37,732
You call him a boyfriend?

25
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:42,672
You're not reading the room, are you?

26
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:49,182
(Episode 3)

27
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:52,123
My arm!

28
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:55,323
- I tapped out. - Your arm's not broken!

29
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,822
Stop acting like it is.

30
00:02:57,822 --> 00:02:59,922
Why are you doing this to me?

31
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,223
What did I do?

32
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,232
You took me hostage...

33
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:04,902
and threatened my life.

34
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:07,863
That was because he was coming after me.

35
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:08,933
I had to get away.

36
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,973
Most people don't run even if they're being chased.

37
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,812
Didn't you run because you did something wrong?

38
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,213
What could I have done wrong?

39
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:20,183
When, where, who, what, why, how?

40
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,613
At what time?

41
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:24,183
I'll report you both! You're in big trouble.

42
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:27,283
I'll report you and this idiot both!

43
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:28,452
How did you get this scar?

44
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:30,093
When?

45
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,632
What? Why do you want to know, Fatty?

46
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:38,603
I'm the only one who gets to call him that.

47
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,662
A Hee, how old were we when you called me that?

48
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:43,832
It was before we started school.

49
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,743
Right? I was 11 back then.

50
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:49,673
I hadn't gotten fat since then.

51
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,743
I'll protect our store!

52
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,213
(Daesung Mart)

53
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:59,583
(Height, weight, body fat percentage)

54
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,492
He moved to our neighbourhood ten years ago.

55
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:06,392
Nephews and nieces.

56
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:08,362
Hey!

57
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:09,933
Repeat after me.

58
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,293
"To give my nephews and nieces pocket money."

59
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:13,232
What?

60
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,233
- What is it? - It's just something I remember.

61
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,603
Repeat after me.

62
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:19,402
- "To give my nephews..." - Okay.

63
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:21,473
- "and nieces pocket money." - Fine. I'll do it.

64
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,012
"To give my nephews and nieces pocket money."

65
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:33,422
I'm going to give my nephews and nieces pocket money.

66
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:35,793
You're him, aren't you? The guy with five-dollar bills.

67
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:38,223
What?

68
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:39,923
Five-dollar bills.

69
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,363
He tried to spend them at our store, but he got caught.

70
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,663
What? The infamous counterfeiter with the five-dollar bills?

71
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,772
Yes. He's the guy.

72
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:49,972
But...

73
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:53,203
you killed him.

74
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:00,442
How do you know that?

75
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:03,913
Well,

76
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,823
I saw it!

77
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:23,003
We must prepare for unpredictable crises.

78
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:26,172
We can protect ourselves through self-defence martial arts.

79
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,873
(Self-defence martial arts to protect yourselves)

(How to escape the cable ties)

81
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:38,552
Forget about snapping it. The cable tie has gotten tighter.

82
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,792
How can he escape from this dangerous situation?

83
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:44,053
Just remember three things.

84
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,562
Number one. Straighten your body.

85
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,733
Number two. Raise your hands above your head.

86
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,903
Number three. Tighten your abdomen.

87
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:53,932
And pull your elbows back as much as you can.

88
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,473
Then swing down your hands hard.

89
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:58,272
- Crises come to you... - Is that possible?

90
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,042
when you least expect them.

91
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:03,242
Remember these three things to escape the cable ties.

92
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:39,982
(Wet wipes, 1.08 dollars)

93
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:56,192
You put me in that tiny cell.

94
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,063
Gosh. Look at this.

95
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,503
Thanks to me, your store got bigger.

96
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,032
This isn't fair!

97
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:08,813
Gosh. Come here!

98
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:12,882
Do you know what infuriates me the most?

99
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:16,413
Everyone in the slammer found out that I was caught...

100
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,283
by a little kid and a woman.

101
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:21,423
Do you know how much the other inmates looked down on me?

102
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:27,693
Come here! Don't move.

103
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:29,562
I should just...

104
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,032
- I'm sorry. - Hold on.

105
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,463
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,203
Fatty. Where are you, Fatty?

107
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,473
Fatty!

108
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:41,103
You'd better show up before I count to three.

109
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:43,143
Or your mother will die because of you!

110
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:44,912
I'm right here, you jerk!

111
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:51,383
Darn it.

112
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,353
Shoot.

113
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:03,862
(Tighten your abdomen, push your elbows, and swing down.)

114
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:13,443
Fatty!

115
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:15,242
(Fish)

116
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:18,143
You jerk! I'm right here! Where are you?

117
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:19,942
I'm at the canned goods section.

118
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:21,412
Mom, go to the seasoning section.

119
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,013
I'm going to kill you.

120
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,212
- Right here. - Where?

121
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,583
Over there!

122
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:28,493
- Fatty. - Die!

123
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,223
You!

124
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,093
You jerk!

125
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,762
- Why are you trying to harm my son? - Darn it.

126
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,172
You little...

131
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:46,962
(An Dae Sung)

132
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:53,742
That was you?

133
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:59,713
My mom was so worried because of the eyewitness.

134
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:01,913
I was going to tell you.

135
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:03,882
But I was scared.

136
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:07,723
I kept waiting to hear the news, but I didn't hear anything.

137
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:10,823
Then you saw him kill a man.

138
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:13,492
- But you still didn't report it? - It was your fault!

139
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:15,533
That was called self-defence.

140
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,263
But still. You're a cop!

141
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,363
I was in elementary school!

142
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:23,133
Thanks to you, I became a cop, so I could catch bad guys like you!

143
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:26,273
Why did you do it?

144
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:28,243
To get revenge on me?

145
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:31,572
You were trying to kill me.

146
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,642
Would you have just let people kill you?

147
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:35,383
But still. How could you commit murder?

148
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,153
You killed an innocent woman at that.

149
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,053
What are you talking about?

150
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:42,652
I didn't kill anyone.

151
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,593
I committed fraud, not murder.

152
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,322
You killed Ms. Kwon Bo Yeon.

153
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:49,992
Chocolate Pie and the vitamin candy came from you.

154
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,232
You pretended to be a witness...

155
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,002
not to be a suspect after you killed her.

156
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:54,563
And you were waiting for me to pass.

157
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:56,173
I need you to tell me...

158
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:59,243
exactly where you were and what you were doing...

159
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,212
last Tuesday at 10pm to 2am. Don't leave anything out.

160
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,443
What's going on?

161
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,043
I didn't do it.

162
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:07,513
I didn't kill her.

163
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,383
A criminal will talk to me with honorifics.

164
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:11,253
Gosh. This is crazy.

165
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:14,022
I mean, I didn't do it, ma'am.

166
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,693
You have the right to remain silent.

167
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,492
Anything you say can be used against you in court.

168
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,192
- You have the right to an attorney. - It hurts.

169
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,473
Mom, I will...

170
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:31,232
- Captain. - I didn't do it.

171
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,402
You're not even going to listen to me?

172
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:36,872
Do you even have evidence or what?

173
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:39,842
- What happened? - The cops came out of the blue.

174
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,282
Gosh. What is it?

175
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,013
- You can't pass through. - Excuse me.

176
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:44,712
Step back.

177
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:46,552
I'm her guardian. I'm her son.

178
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:47,623
An Dae Sung.

179
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,623
I'm An Dae Sung.

180
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:56,892
Ma'am, you can't come in.

181
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,263
- Mom. - Dae Sung.

182
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:01,103
Dae Sung. I...

183
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,303
I felt bad that I was harsh to her the other day.

184
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,102
When I was in the area for a delivery,

185
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,642
I was going to leave after I checked on her.

186
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:09,943
But...

187
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,212
(Samyu Peaches)

188
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,083
The real estate agent...

189
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:17,353
He asked me to come inside with him, so I did.

190
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:21,283
When I saw the can, I was so scared.

191
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,952
I felt so bad for that lady.

192
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,462
Oh, no. Dae Seung.

193
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,593
Mom, you don't have to be scared.

194
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:31,693
We caught him. Five Dollars.

195
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:36,303
Five Dollars? Why are you bringing him up now?

196
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,103
He was the culprit.

197
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:39,343
What?

198
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:41,542
Kwon Bo Yeon...

199
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:43,743
and Lee Kyung A...

200
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,582
The culprit used a can of peaches, right?

201
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:50,352
- Was it a blow to the head? - Dae Sung. Don't worry about it.

202
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,982
Five Dollars bought a can of peaches and a can opener.

203
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:54,822
A volunteer from church already gave him some,

204
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,292
- but he bought them again today. - Hey.

205
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:59,492
Five Dollars came to our store?

206
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:04,832
Gosh. Darn it.

207
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,762
Why did you bring me here?

208
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,502
That's Nunchucks Grandpa.

209
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:15,743
So he's Five Dollars.

210
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:18,012
He's secretly been living in our neighbourhood for a decade,

211
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:19,183
but we didn't know.

212
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:20,842
Straighten your back.

213
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,053
Hey, it hurts.

214
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,793
Gosh.

215
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:39,232
What are you doing, Ms. Han?

216
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:41,562
Why did you do that?

217
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:49,972
He is...

218
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:51,673
Five Dollars.

219
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:54,243
He pretended to be 30 years older than he actually is.

220
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,612
No wonder we never looked into him closely.

221
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:57,982
Officer Do.

222
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:01,083
Is it really him? Did you check?

223
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:04,092
I'll have to check his true identity first,

224
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,292
but he admitted that he's Five Dollars.

225
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:07,492
See that?

226
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,162
I said you were wrong.

227
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:11,063
I said it wasn't my son,

228
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,703
but you thought he was the murderer.

229
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:19,373
I thought...

230
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:22,142
he died back then.

231
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,652
Help me.

232
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:30,853
Please.

233
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:39,162
Help me.

234
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:43,493
Please.

235
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:52,473
You left me to die!

236
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,743
You knew I wasn't dead!

237
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:56,973
Be quiet, you punk.

238
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,943
You jerk. You deserve to die!

239
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,382
You scumbag.

240
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:04,913
I don't deserve that!

241
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:08,253
It's all your fault!

242
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:10,123
Don't you dare talk to my son like that.

243
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:14,192
Do you know what you've done to his life?

244
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:17,063
Because you disappeared,

245
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,733
my smart son was afraid you might come back.

246
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:23,472
He couldn't focus on the exam.

247
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:27,743
He became anxious after that.

248
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:28,972
Good luck.

249
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,572
- Keep calm. - Yes.

250
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:31,842
- Good luck. - You can do it.

251
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:34,442
- Good luck. - Best wishes.

00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:38,252
(2011 National Civil Service 1st Exam)

253
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:45,222
I'm going to give my nephews and nieces pocket money.

254
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:51,662
I got a bunch of new bills at the bank.

255
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:56,272
I'm going to give my nephews and nieces pocket money.

256
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,872
(Personal Registration Number)

257
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,943
(2016 Level 7 National Civil Service Exam)

258
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:14,482
(Samyu Peaches)

259
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,933
(I'm be back.)

260
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:32,442
(2020 Level 9 National Civil Service Exam)

261
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:00,733
I thought I ruined his life...

262
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:04,873
for opening the store. I blamed myself.

263
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:05,872
An Dae Sung?

264
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,773
Yes.

265
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,073
You're in the murder scene again before I am.

266
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:13,842
- Is that a coincidence? - Exactly.

267
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:17,082
What kind of strange coincidence is that?

268
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:19,753
When the body was found,

269
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:22,453
he kept wandering around the area.

270
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:25,152
Don't you frame it on him.

271
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,892
This jerk forged money.

272
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:30,363
He stole someone else's identity!

273
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:33,932
He killed those people too.

274
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:36,772
I didn't kill anyone.

275
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:39,973
- Stop it! - Don't frame it on my son!

276
00:17:39,973 --> 00:17:42,073
- Stop! - Why are you hitting me?

277
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,172
Kill me!

278
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:47,643
Is this a neighbourhood gathering on a crime scene?

279
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:49,583
How can we catch a culprit like this?

280
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,583
But it's not exactly...

281
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:55,922
unrelated to this incident.

282
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,792
It was strange...

283
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:59,763
that he passed out after finding the body.

284
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:00,993
You went too far.

285
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,863
You always practiced the nunchucks near the scene...

286
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,532
from dawn until dusk.

287
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:08,433
He'd know everything that happened there.

288
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,772
Seriously.

289
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:14,803
It's not me. I didn't kill anyone.

290
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,313
If someone plans to hide the body,

291
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,543
he'd do it when I'm not there.

292
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:20,683
Would you do it when I'm there?

293
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,612
We're not saying you're the witness.

294
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:24,782
We're saying you did it.

295
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:25,883
You little...

296
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:27,252
Officer Do.

297
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:29,892
Take these three home.

298
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,822
We can't do anything like this.

299
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:34,262
What about him?

300
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:35,733
Leave him here.

301
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,533
Detective Choi will take care of him.

302
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,433
- Detective Lee. Take him. - Yes.

303
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,603
We'll take the suspect.

304
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:52,282
I'm sorry, Ms. Han.

305
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:54,142
I got you involved.

306
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:57,152
It's okay.

307
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,682
You must be shocked too.

308
00:19:00,283 --> 00:19:03,723
Oh, that's right. Yul must be alone at home.

309
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,123
You should go.

310
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:07,322
I'll get going first.

311
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:08,322
Bye.

312
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,943
Mother. Get in.

313
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:23,373
No. I feel stuffy.

314
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:26,712
I'd rather walk.

315
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:45,832
- Sorry. - Sorry.

316
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:49,602
Pardon? What?

317
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,233
I couldn't save you...

318
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:53,602
when you were in danger in the hospital.

319
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:57,243
Did you think I was in danger?

320
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,412
I was busy calming you down...

321
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,342
rather than subduing that jerk.

322
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:03,252
Look at you.

323
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:05,252
You brat.

324
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:09,652
A Hee.

325
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:13,492
You knew everything, didn't you?

326
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:15,322
Oh, that...

327
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:18,063
Yes.

328
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:22,233
I didn't plan to hide it on purpose.

329
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:28,102
It must've been tough...

331
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:30,513
for a little girl.

332
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:32,312
You still don't know her.

333
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:33,682
Didn't you see that?

334
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:36,382
Wait.

335
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:40,983
I...

336
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:45,522
became a police officer to save Dae Sung.

337
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,093
To stop bad guys from coming to this neighbourhood again.

338
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:54,662
Yes. I know.

339
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:58,933
Thanks to you, that jerk couldn't do anything...

340
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,002
in the past ten years.

341
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:03,972
It's all thanks to you.

342
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:08,312
I'm so proud of you.

343
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:09,582
Mother.

344
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:15,753
Let's go.

345
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,562
A Hee. Do you know...

346
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:25,163
what my life was like...

347
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,932
with his immature dad?

348
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:31,032
Enjoy what's good twice...

349
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:33,173
and avoid what's bad just after once.

350
00:21:35,443 --> 00:21:37,343
That's the kind of life I had.

351
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:40,942
I thought getting rid of the bad stuff...

352
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:43,753
out of sight and out of mind...

353
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:46,923
was the only way to protect my family.

354
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:49,693
That was my belief.

355
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,223
But...

356
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,363
I think I was wrong about it.

357
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:58,962
- I... - You didn't do anything wrong.

358
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:03,332
We didn't do anything wrong.

359
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:06,143
Do you know what upsets me?

360
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:11,143
I feel like my life became pathetic because of that pathetic jerk.

361
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:14,612
I was full of myself...

362
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:16,082
because I was on TV and people kept saying I was smart.

363
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:18,352
But the truth is,

364
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:21,982
I have nothing.

365
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:22,993
Dae Sung.

366
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:25,393
You're not pathetic.

367
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:27,423
Just because you failed the state exam...

368
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:28,792
a few times?

369
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:30,962
Besides,

370
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,162
you were not the only one who was scared.

371
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:36,472
You were scared too?

372
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:40,373
Do you think I'm not human?

373
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,973
How can I sleep in peace after what happened?

374
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:47,942
I still wake up in the middle of the night...

375
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:49,983
and check the store with a knife in my hand.

376
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:53,782
It's great that we caught him.

377
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:57,252
I wouldn't be scared to go to bed anymore.

378
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,323
So,

379
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:03,863
you can stop coming to the store.

380
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,563
- What? - He's arrested.

381
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:09,372
We have nothing to be scared of anymore.

382
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:13,103
It's about time to stop.

383
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:14,672
What do I do then?

384
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:16,142
Don't ask me.

385
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:18,242
- Can I do what I want now? - Of course.

386
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:19,513
Let me work for a month then.

387
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:27,583
I'll work to the end of this month.

388
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:29,153
We need to increase the sales.

389
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:32,622
I promised you.

390
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,729
- It was a young woman. - Gosh, I'm too scared to stay now.

391
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:50,559
It really is so scary.

392
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,230
I wonder if I can move.

393
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:11,363
Hang on.

394
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,103
Oh, wow.

395
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:30,883
A Hee.

396
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:37,893
It's still cold out.

397
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:39,262
Thank you.

398
00:24:42,592 --> 00:24:43,702
What's this?

399
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:46,873
Just wait. I'll make you something delicious.

400
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:49,403
(Soju)

401
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:03,682
Tada.

402
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:06,722
Wow.

403
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:18,403
Here.

404
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:31,482
- Isn't it good? - It's lovely.

405
00:25:48,332 --> 00:25:52,632
(Soju)

406
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,882
- Cheers. - Cheers.

407
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:26,833
(MS Mart)

408
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:30,302
(Soju)

409
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:36,443
Dae Sung.

410
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:40,952
Will you really go on working at the store?

411
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:45,323
I can't work here forever.

412
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:49,722
Once Five Dollars is confirmed as the killer, I'll quit.

413
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:54,563
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

414
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:57,602
Because you found the body first?

415
00:26:57,862 --> 00:26:59,572
Don't say it's to help me.

416
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:02,673
I kept thinking of this.

417
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:07,073
This toy washing machine?

418
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:11,012
The day Kwon Bo Yeon last came to our store,

419
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:12,713
she bought this.

420
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:15,383
She usually doesn't,

421
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:19,082
but oddly, she spoke to me first that day.

422
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:22,693
- Welcome. - Hello.

423
00:27:22,823 --> 00:27:28,233
(Operational Washing Machine)

424
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:31,232
You should stock up on this.

425
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:33,232
Why?

426
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,402
- Is it for kindergarten class? - No.

427
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,702
It's for adults.

428
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:43,513
A shot of soju and half a cup of beer.

429
00:27:43,983 --> 00:27:46,043
- Mix it in this. - What?

430
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:48,712
That toy washing machine is a great shaker.

431
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:49,853
What?

432
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,923
A mom of one of the kids told me.

433
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,452
She said it takes the boredom away of drinking alone.

434
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,132
That'll be 14 dollars 34 cents.

435
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:02,432
Okay. Here you go.

436
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,202
- Do you need a receipt? - Yes.

437
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:09,102
Thank you.

438
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:11,743
(Usable points: 31,630)

439
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:15,473
I finally have over 30,000 points?

440
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,482
Can I use it like cash next time?

441
00:28:17,682 --> 00:28:20,652
- Yes. Don't forget to. - I won't.

442
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:22,082
Thank you.

443
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:25,583
I kept...

444
00:28:27,892 --> 00:28:29,052
thinking of that.

445
00:28:31,362 --> 00:28:34,032
At first, I only remembered her dead body.

446
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:37,903
After a while,

447
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:42,073
I kept thinking of...

448
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:49,912
the last time we met.

449
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:53,412
Kwon Bo Yeon...

450
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,653
and Lee Kyung A was alive too.

451
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:00,553
It feels so weird.

452
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,343
This really does taste good.

453
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:24,083
I wonder if it tastes like what Kwon Bo Yeon had.

454
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:43,602
Wait, go back.

455
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:44,802
Back?

456
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:46,573
A bit more.

457
00:29:46,803 --> 00:29:48,673
A bit more.

458
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:52,543
There. that person going in. It's him, isn't it?

459
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:53,742
It is.

460
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:55,942
- It's him. - Okay.

461
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,782
Captain, we found it.

462
00:30:02,313 --> 00:30:06,153
So you're saying you left the plastic bags on the handles,

463
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:08,653
but someone else switched the contents?

464
00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:10,493
Does that make sense?

465
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:13,892
It's the truth.

466
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:17,533
The person who hung the bags on the door handles,

467
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,503
that was me.

468
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:20,933
Why did you do that, then?

469
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:25,872
To get revenge.

470
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:30,143
If weird rumours about that store spread,

471
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:31,712
women would stop going there.

472
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:34,153
Then the store would go bankrupt...

473
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:37,752
and the kid would lose everything. I wanted that to happen!

474
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,153
Okay, and then?

475
00:30:39,652 --> 00:30:44,462
I really didn't kill anyone!

476
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:47,862
The bags I left only had the Chocolate Pie.

477
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:49,902
That's all I left.

478
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:51,733
What about the tampons, then?

479
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,403
What's that?

480
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:02,943
(Tampons)

481
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,612
What are these for?

482
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,682
It's a feminine product.

483
00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:08,852
Oh, it's for women who...

484
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:12,422
reach that time of the month? It's for that?

485
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:14,622
How are we to believe you?

486
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:19,093
You pretended to be an old man for ten years to stay in hiding.

487
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:21,562
And now you want us to believe you?

488
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:23,632
Could you if you were us?

489
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,932
This is all because of that punk!

490
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:29,873
That punk's the reason I ended up going to prison!

491
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:34,073
I worked my fingers to the bone to keep my business going.

492
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,242
I tried to manage somehow.

493
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:38,112
But I lost everything.

494
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:41,452
Do you see how stressed out I was?

495
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:45,283
Then suddenly, one day, I got all wrinkly...

496
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:46,753
and my hair fell out.

497
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:49,863
That's when my voice changed too.

498
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:52,562
And then, after a while,

499
00:31:52,763 --> 00:31:56,093
people started calling me a grandpa.

500
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:57,162
So,

501
00:31:57,703 --> 00:32:00,433
you left bags of Chocolate Pie on the doors of units...

502
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:03,972
where women lived alone to spread a rumour...

503
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,242
about the store to put them out of business?

504
00:32:06,642 --> 00:32:08,842
- To scare them? - That's it.

505
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:10,813
That's all I admit to.

506
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:13,083
Okay. So you confessed to stalking.

507
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:16,213
When did I confess to that?

508
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:18,083
How is this stalking?

509
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:21,623
I just left Chocolate Pie hanging on the doors!

510
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:24,562
You did it to scare people and that makes it a crime, sir.

511
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:27,863
You're slow on the uptake and didn't know that...

512
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:30,133
stalking's a crime now.

513
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:33,572
We have time to spare.

514
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:36,402
More than enough to make murder stick.

515
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:39,003
No! I didn't kill anyone!

516
00:32:39,003 --> 00:32:40,443
Why would I murder anyone?

517
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,643
Let me rewrite this.

518
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:45,542
I didn't kill anyone.

519
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:47,213
- My gosh. - This is why I'm against...

520
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:49,083
the redevelopment project.

521
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:50,982
What if we get a bunch of low lives after it gets redeveloped?

522
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:52,183
How will we handle that?

523
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:54,152
Do you think you can do it? Don't you agree?

524
00:32:54,922 --> 00:32:56,762
So you should both sign the petitions...

525
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,563
to oppose the redevelopment project.

526
00:32:58,692 --> 00:32:59,932
Do it right away.

527
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:02,832
By the way, didn't you hear another news?

528
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:06,062
I heard something like this happened before quite often.

529
00:33:06,063 --> 00:33:07,903
I heard plastic bags from Daesung Mart...

530
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:10,802
were hanging on the doors where women lived alone.

531
00:33:10,803 --> 00:33:13,813
Wait. So the old man has been doing that the whole time?

532
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:16,543
No. From what I heard,

533
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:18,883
it was the son's doing.

534
00:33:18,882 --> 00:33:20,682
Gosh. No way.

535
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:23,622
Don't you know how handsome his father is?

536
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:26,452
I mean, he has a great father.

537
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:30,162
But I heard something creepier than that.

538
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:32,092
A long time ago, he killed someone...

539
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:33,732
and hid the body inside the supermarket.

540
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:35,062
Gosh.

541
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,562
- Goodness. - Hey. Let's go. How creepy.

542
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,662
But isn't he odd?

543
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:41,903
I'm talking about An Dae Sung.

544
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:43,402
When he was young,

545
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:47,572
he was so smart that he could spot a counterfeit bill right away.

546
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:50,513
But he failed to recognize me for a decade.

547
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:53,083
That's weird. Isn't it? It doesn't add up, right?

548
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:56,722
So he must have known everything all along.

549
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:59,753
But he must have pretended that he didn't recognize me.

550
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:01,553
Then he used me...

551
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:03,423
to satisfy all of his urges.

552
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:06,392
That way, he could frame me for everything.

553
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:09,293
In other words, this was completely planned.

554
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:11,402
That's your plan.

555
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:17,543
You see? He killed someone before too.

556
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,602
Me. Look at this.

557
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:22,973
He almost killed me. I'm serious.

558
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:26,343
He knew that I was dead.

559
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:28,852
But he's been living his life as if nothing happened shamelessly.

560
00:34:29,053 --> 00:34:30,923
Here's a thing about killing people.

561
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:32,383
The first time is always hard.

562
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:34,952
Do you think it will be hard the second or third time around?

563
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:37,523
I see. You're so smart.

564
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,862
You're coaching me how to investigate.

565
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:43,662
But that's not enough to get you off the hook.

566
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,433
We have evidence on you.

567
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:47,703
We only have circumstantial evidence against him. No hard evidence.

568
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,372
Then what if I didn't do it?

569
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:52,203
What will you do then?

570
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,203
What?

571
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:57,643
Okay. So if another woman gets murdered just like this one...

572
00:34:57,643 --> 00:35:00,713
when I'm in prison,

573
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,322
my alibi will be confirmed then.

574
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:05,123
You'll trust me then.

575
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:10,522
He's not the culprit?

576
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,462
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

577
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:14,392
So I got the security camera footage.

578
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,563
Hello. Have some of this.

579
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,273
Thank you.

580
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:21,773
(Acupressure Massage)

581
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:24,302
He has a rock solid alibi around the estimated time of death.

582
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,072
His alibi is clear as day.

583
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:28,213
We can't argue that he did it.

584
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,512
But he admitted to stalking those women.

585
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:31,683
He must have an accomplice.

586
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:32,683
Hey.

587
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,013
Detective Choi will take care of it.

588
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:37,023
Anyway, we can hold him for the time being.

589
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:44,262
Gosh.

590
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:52,732
Goodness. Don't get so mad.

591
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:54,902
You'll look old if you get laugh lines.

592
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:56,232
Give me your hand.

593
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:03,712
Give me your hand.

594
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,383
Have a good day.

595
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:12,583
Here. Take this.

596
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,923
Have a good day.

597
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:17,823
(Gosh. She's so good.)

598
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:19,763
(In full control)

599
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:21,963
It's for free

600
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,762
You're not going to have lunch? Aren't you hungry?

601
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,073
If we hold a singing contest, will our sales go up?

602
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:30,873
I'm not sure. It will attract some customers.

603
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,472
(Singing contest)

604
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:36,273
Gosh. You're working hard at it.

605
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,083
I'll go have lunch first.

606
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,243
- Okay? - Okay.

607
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:44,553
- Did you eat? - Enjoy your lunch.

608
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:45,553
Thanks.

609
00:36:58,962 --> 00:36:59,962
Hey.

610
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,903
Do you have a hair band I can borrow?

611
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:03,373
No.

612
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:08,372
Here.

613
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:10,643
What's that?

614
00:37:13,453 --> 00:37:15,513
Why are you giving this to me?

615
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:17,783
My sister told me to get one for her.

616
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:19,722
But you seem to need it, so you should use it.

617
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:24,262
Hey, she and I have the same taste in accessories.

618
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:26,932
- Thanks. I'll use it well. - Okay.

619
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,803
I'll pay you for this. Order one more for her.

620
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:33,433
It's fine. Eat a lot.

621
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:34,433
Okay.

622
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:42,712
Where have you been?

623
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,282
We were waiting for you.

624
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:46,043
We just started our lunch.

625
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:53,053
Let's perform a ritual.

626
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:56,923
A Buddhist at Nawoo Temple is friends with a gifted shaman.

627
00:37:56,922 --> 00:37:58,462
The shaman was possessed two days ago.

628
00:37:58,663 --> 00:37:59,663
Goodness.

629
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:02,793
She cooks at the temple. Why is she friends with a shaman?

630
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,462
Hey, that's not the point.

631
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:06,332
This store has a bad vibe.

632
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,733
This is where we work.

633
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:09,573
The energy here wasn't great...

634
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:12,203
when the counterfeiter came to this store all those years ago.

635
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:14,973
You said the store expanded into a supermarket because it did well.

636
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:16,982
We can't say the energy here is bad.

637
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,452
Well, is that so?

638
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:26,082
I mean, two of our customers died.

639
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,323
And Dae Sung witnessed the dead body of the first victim.

640
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:31,392
Sit.

641
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,332
And Boss found the second body.

642
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:46,572
Dae Sung. You might not have passed the exam...

643
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,273
because there's bad energy here.

644
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:49,672
Why are you bringing that up now?

645
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:54,152
Right. The vegetable section gave me an eerie feeling.

646
00:38:54,513 --> 00:38:56,613
I start wearing long Johns in September.

647
00:38:56,823 --> 00:39:00,623
The cold air always surrounds my lower body.

648
00:39:00,623 --> 00:39:02,123
That's coming from the fridge.

649
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:03,793
Gosh. Come on.

650
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:06,662
What are we going to do if the supermarket closes down?

651
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:08,963
Everyone knows I work here.

652
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:11,032
I'll be lucky if people don't call me I'm bad luck.

653
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:14,202
They are already on edge about the property value going down.

654
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:16,633
But I thought they caught the culprit.

655
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:18,343
Doesn't it mean we're in the clear?

656
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:19,842
- Nunchucks? - Yes.

657
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:23,013
Hey, he's a mere stalker.

658
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:24,942
He wasn't the murderer.

659
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:28,452
- Who said that? - I was at the police substation.

660
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:30,783
That's what Captain Kim said to Do Crazy.

661
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:34,252
Hey.

662
00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:38,092
What's wrong with him?

663
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,833
There's nothing we can do legally.

664
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,633
So you need to be careful.

665
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:50,302
It's a stun gun.

666
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,873
Tell your mom to take it when she goes out for deliveries.

667
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:54,172
Five Dollars...

668
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,382
Does it mean he can be released?

669
00:39:57,382 --> 00:39:58,542
Even if we indict him...

670
00:39:58,542 --> 00:39:59,712
for violating the Stalker Prevention Act,

671
00:39:59,712 --> 00:40:01,012
he won't get a heavy sentence.

672
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:02,712
And it's not like there are victims...

673
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:04,152
who can file a lawsuit in the civil court.

674
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,922
The can of peaches was the murder weapon.

675
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:08,653
Chocolate Pie. Can of peaches. They all connect to me.

676
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:11,292
They connect to you too. Right?

677
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:14,532
Only considering the murder weapon, you might be a suspect too.

678
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,033
What?

679
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,003
I understand you're concerned.

680
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:21,203
But don't talk about this case to people other than me.

681
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,002
Okay?

682
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:44,292
There was no security camera...

683
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:45,522
around the crime scene of Kwon Bo Yeon's murder?

684
00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:47,292
No. There was one at the playground.

685
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:49,192
But not the crime scene because it's too dark.

686
00:40:49,562 --> 00:40:52,432
There should be one because it's dark there!

687
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:55,632
Why are you taking it out on me?

688
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:57,502
Seriously. Darn it.

689
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:43,483
You know when that grandpa gets released...

690
00:41:43,482 --> 00:41:44,982
He's not a grandpa, apparently.

691
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:48,223
Right. Once the counterfeiter is released,

692
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,592
he will stay in this neighbourhood?

693
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:53,122
His home is here. So I guess he'll be here for the time being.

694
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:54,763
Gosh. Right?

695
00:41:55,732 --> 00:41:57,702
I'm scared to walk home alone...

696
00:41:57,703 --> 00:41:59,363
on the nights I have to close.

697
00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:02,203
- Well, I can... - Ask your husband to pick you up.

698
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:03,803
What?

699
00:42:04,803 --> 00:42:08,073
He's been working late every day these days.

700
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:09,643
He's busy.

701
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,883
You need to come off the training wheels now.

702
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:17,553
Okay.

703
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:21,722
Two squids for ten dollars.

704
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:24,293
If you charm me, I'll give 3 for 10 dollars.

705
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,392
- Thank you. - Mr. Handsome, sing a song for us.

706
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:28,393
- Gosh. I can't sing. - A trot song, if you will.

707
00:42:28,393 --> 00:42:30,863
- Gosh. - Come on. Rap or something.

708
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:32,462
Goodness.

709
00:42:35,272 --> 00:42:36,272
Let's see.

710
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:37,772
Let's see.

711
00:42:38,203 --> 00:42:40,103
Let's check out the fish today.

712
00:42:40,103 --> 00:42:41,713
The mackerels look great.

713
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:44,112
And squids look fresh.

714
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:45,283
And the hairtail...

715
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:46,783
It's shining.

716
00:42:47,953 --> 00:42:50,483
What would you like, ma'am?

717
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:52,022
- The squid. - The squid?

718
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:55,392
Two squids please.

719
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:56,723
He's good.

720
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:58,662
I'll take one.

721
00:42:58,763 --> 00:42:59,863
Thank you.

722
00:42:59,862 --> 00:43:01,162
Who on earth is he?

723
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:19,112
Bye.

724
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:22,382
Two squids coming right up.

725
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,852
Two squids are coming.

726
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:25,983
- Hey. - It's only on sale today.

727
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:27,622
- What? - It's on sale.

728
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:34,762
(Employees only)

729
00:43:34,763 --> 00:43:35,833
Where did you get that jerky from?

730
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:38,763
My dad made a new deal to expand his business.

731
00:43:41,502 --> 00:43:42,632
This is so good.

732
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:48,743
What?

733
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:50,213
You told me to follow you.

734
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:51,742
- Oh, right. - "Right"?

735
00:43:52,783 --> 00:43:54,213
Do you know where Fish lives?

736
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:55,612
- Fish? - Does anyone know?

737
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:56,952
Does he live in Nadeuri Apartment?

738
00:43:56,953 --> 00:43:59,723
I heard he moved before working here.

739
00:44:00,323 --> 00:44:01,623
But I don't know where he lives.

740
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:03,152
Check his resume.

741
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:04,623
His resume?

742
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:07,163
A free rider wouldn't know that.

743
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,962
Why? Do you think he's the culprit?

744
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,262
No. Why do you think he's the culprit?

745
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:16,733
I'm asking if that's what you think.

746
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:19,903
Did you burn your brain with workbooks? What's wrong with you?

00:44:27,453 --> 00:44:29,183
- Do you live alone? - Pardon?

750
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:31,423
I get very lonely,

751
00:44:31,553 --> 00:44:33,993
but yesterday I was glad I live alone.

752
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:36,792
I don't want to share this delicious food with anyone else.

753
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:40,733
- Please come again. - Bye.

754
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:54,713
Hello.

756
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:03,512
He does live in Nadeuri Apartment.

757
00:45:08,711 --> 00:45:10,051
Try this.

758
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:17,191
It's so sweet.

759
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:20,691
It's Ms. Han.

760
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:28,415
Yul.

761
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:30,746
There you are.

762
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:34,086
Did you have lunch, Yul?

763
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:36,215
Try some mandarin.

764
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:37,626
Here.

765
00:45:38,885 --> 00:45:40,795
How is it? Is it sweet?

766
00:45:41,756 --> 00:45:43,896
- Do you want more? - I'm good.

767
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:47,066
That's not true.

768
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,595
I see your eyes are bulging.

769
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:50,096
You're hungry, aren't you?

770
00:45:50,606 --> 00:45:52,836
Come with me. I'm going home.

771
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,006
I'll cook for you.

772
00:45:54,106 --> 00:45:57,006
My dad will get mad at me if I go to a stranger's house.

773
00:45:57,075 --> 00:46:00,245
Why would he? I'm not a stranger.

774
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,376
Am I right?

775
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:03,916
Oh, yes.

776
00:46:04,046 --> 00:46:07,116
I'll give your dad a call. Ask her to make you something good.

777
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:09,485
Yul. What's your favourite food?

778
00:46:09,486 --> 00:46:11,126
I'll make everything you want.

779
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:14,596
Bulgogi?

780
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:16,195
Bulgogi?

781
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:20,536
I have pork at home.

782
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:22,765
I'll make you kimchi fried rice.

783
00:46:22,765 --> 00:46:24,565
- How does that sound? - Wait a minute.

784
00:46:24,836 --> 00:46:27,206
She said she wants bulgogi,

785
00:46:27,205 --> 00:46:28,935
but you'll make her kimchi fried rice?

786
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:30,905
Are you out of meat?

787
00:46:31,146 --> 00:46:33,376
I'll order it for you.

788
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,576
You should've told me.

789
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,075
Yes, Meat.

790
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:40,985
The chairwoman will be there soon.

791
00:46:40,986 --> 00:46:43,886
Have prime Korean beef for bulgogi ready.

792
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:45,385
What?

793
00:46:47,225 --> 00:46:49,495
How can you recommend...

794
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:51,665
One A-plus meat to the chairwoman?

795
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:54,636
Double A. Yes.

(Do A Hee)

797
00:46:57,265 --> 00:46:59,735
It sounds suspicious...

798
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:01,336
that he paid attention to a woman who lives alone.

799
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:04,275
That's not all. Why would he peek at Kyung A's house?

800
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:06,406
- What would you like? - He's suspicious.

801
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:08,345
We need more clear evidence.

802
00:47:09,015 --> 00:47:10,845
Still, we need to check on him.

803
00:47:11,146 --> 00:47:13,116
- How? - I'll handle it.

804
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:14,215
Talk to you later.

805

806
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:17,626

Meat asked me to bring something.

820
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:14,635
What's with your leg?

821
00:49:16,276 --> 00:49:17,346

thinking they were cilantro.

828

I'm sad.

836
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:06,316
She was nice to me.

837
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:08,816
She used to give me snacks.

838
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:11,926

You should go home.

What should I call you, then?

Call me "Fish".

848
00:53:37,365 --> 00:53:38,865

862
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:27,445
He left early because he sold out.

863
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:28,456
Did he?

864
00:54:29,486 --> 00:54:32,326
Then I should order more fish for tomorrow.

865
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:35,525
He asked me to tell you he already placed the order.

866
00:54:43,995 --> 00:54:45,235
Did you see "The Silence of the Lambs"?

867

No, not Hannibal.

868
00:54:49,805 --> 00:54:52,405
There's a Buffalo-someone who makes a mask with women's skin.

869
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:53,945
That can't be used as evidence.

870

00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:02,916
