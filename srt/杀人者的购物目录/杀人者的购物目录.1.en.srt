I wonder too.

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,400
I should visit the substation...

56
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,071
and ask them about it.

57

What did your girlfriend, Do Crazy, say? Is she cool with it?

239

Her name isn't Do Crazy. It's Do A Hee.

240
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,870
You think I'm calling her Do Crazy because I don't know her name?

241
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,541
I couldn't care less about her name.

242
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,770
You're bound to give up on the exam and get dumped by her.

243
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,510

244
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,081

254
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,840
that men also need to put on some makeup these days?

00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,780
- Bye. I'll be late. - Let me dab it a bit more.

260
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,680
- Wait. Your forehead. Hey. - Gosh.

261

Great. I like it. A pineapple.

268
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,631
But this doesn't look "fine".

269

- This isn't a fine pineapple. Okay? - Just come in.

270

284

300
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,000

301
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,460
- Can you two manage? - Yes. You can go.

366
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:34,831
- Take care. - Bye.

367
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:37,561
- Why must I do this? - Get moving.

368
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:40,901
Ms. Han, I brought this.

369
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
Okay, great.

370
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,770
Good job. Well done.

371
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,480
I'll take that.

372
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,011
Come on.

373
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:56,581
- Watch your step. - Okay.

374
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,980
Oh, gosh.

375
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,161
A Hee.

376
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm no longer the son of a building owner.

377
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,630
Hey.

(MS Mart)

379
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,300
Oh, dear.

380
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,411
- It's lovely. - It is.

381
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,010
- Meat, come here. - Why?

382
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:28,281
Here. Take this with you at least.

383
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:29,551
Thanks.

384
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,651
You were a great help.

385
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,320
- I'd be stuck without you. - Not at all.

(Sung)

387
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:37,161
Thank you. And well done.

388
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,520
- I'll get going. - Okay.

389
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:39,891
- See you tomorrow. - Sure.

390
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,460
- Meat, you're the best. - Thank you.

391
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:47,431

Dae Sung. What are you doing?

395
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,780
This is...

396
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:04,151
the only remnant of our memory.

397
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:09,291
My goodness.

398

"The only remnant of our memory", my foot.

399
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,191
Here. Read this.

400
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:16,761
It's Myung Sook's store,

401
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,861
so that makes it MS Mart.

402
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:21,331
I took the initials. Doesn't it look nice?

403
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,970
Were you conned by a friend?

404
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,440
(MS Mart)

405
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,140
Hand these out to all the apartment blocks around.

406
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,280
The start is most important.

407
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:33,851
Who is Myung Sook that you'd do this for her?

408
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,150
Do you know your mom's name?

409
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,250
It's Han Myung...

410
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,050
Ms. Han.

411
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:44,491
We didn't lose the store, then?

412
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:47,931
Renewal. Re-modeling. You know?

413
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,130
I thought about it.

414
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,700
What did you do to deserve a store named after you?

415
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:57,001
Then what's all this?

416
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:59,441
- Your stuff. - My stuff? What for?

417
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,471
I thought about it.

418
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,240
What did you do to deserve free room and board?

419
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:08,111
Move out.

420
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,650
I have nowhere to go.

421
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:15,051
I have just 12 cents in my transport card.

422
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,911
Pay back the 10,000 dollar deposit within a year.

423
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:39,141
Let's set the monthly rent at just 350 dollars.

424
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,380
I'll be nice and let you pay later.

425
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:49,921
No human can live here.

426
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,520
- Then leave when you become human. - Mom!

427
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:54,091
Then find a place of your own.

428
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,230
Give me a job, then.

429
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:57,801
Me?

430
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:00,131
How can I do that?

431
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:01,631
Boss.

432
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,770
I have 30 years cashier experience.

433

434

435

PR, I can do it all.

436
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:16,111
You used to do all that for free.

437
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,281
I had room and board.

438
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,320
Now I don't, so pay me.

439
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:21,651
Please.

440
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,890
Deal. But you're on probation for the first month.

441
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,130
- I have work experience. - You skipped the hiring process.

442
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,030
The other staff will complain.

443
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:32,901
Take it or leave it.

444
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,770
You are so very fair.

445
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
Hand out the flyers first.

446
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:42,341
- At this hour? - Yes. Do it in secret.

447
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,710
We have to pay a fee to enter the complex during the day.

448
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,310
Do your best.

Darn it.

456
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:49,971
It's definitely not dementia.

457
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:52,841
He does it on purpose.

Do you know the Nunchucks Grandpa from the playground?

461

He's screaming and keeping me up.

462
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,160
I called you instead of the police.

463
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:13,871
Oh, yes, thank you. I'll check right away.

Yes. Why?

469

You messed up my delivery.

470
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,681
I never ordered this.

It's the second time this week.

472
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:06,021
That can't be.

473

How can you be so sure without even checking?

Three Chocolate Pie,

475
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,490
a box of 20 tampons.

476
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:12,821
That's 10 dollars 40 cents.

477
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,330
Do you expect me to pay you for that?

478
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,130
I said I didn't order these.

479
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,000
We deliver only if you spend over 30 dollars.

You don't need to make deliveries anymore.

502

- You don't need the bike anymore. - But...

No, it was Nadeul.

Honey, you gave me Rebecca as a gift.

511
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:55,515
You're not the kind of person who takes back a gift.

512

That's right, I'm not.

513
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:02,064

(Eggplant please don't go)

549
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,655
Are you telling them to live here?

550
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:15,664
(Veggie, age 38)

551
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,274
(Expert with entitled jerks. Countryside beauty queen)

552
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,225
Don't you know today is a war?

553
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:20,334
They're clearly eggplants.

554
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,144
They think it's a special promo...

555
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,475
and flock to me.

556
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:26,905
I see.

557
00:40:36,385 --> 00:40:39,115
(Don't go, my dear eggplant.)

558
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:42,655
This is okay.

559
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:43,955
It is?

560
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:46,345
You bolded "eggplant" right there.

561
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:47,425
Okay.

562
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:49,865
Gosh.

563
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:01,975
Okay.

564
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:05,075
(Carrots 1 dollar)

565
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:10,405
We still do this?

566
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:12,394
I hated it at first too,

567
00:41:12,385 --> 00:41:13,575
but it's effective.

568
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,164
It fixed my slipped disk.

569
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:24,294
Get over here.

570
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,044
He failed again, didn't he?

571
00:41:28,104 --> 00:41:29,774
I think he and Do Crazy broke up...

572
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:31,325
seeing the garbage he's printing on the price tags.

573
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,975
Gosh. He's never changing.

574
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:40,845
Dae Sung will be our cashier starting today.

575
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,354
He's not taking the test anymore.

576
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:45,805
Goodness.

577
00:41:45,814 --> 00:41:49,164
Lucky Dae Sung. It's nice coming from money.

578
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:53,515
Who cares about the test?

579
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:56,394
That's good. You should inherit the store.

580
00:41:56,995 --> 00:41:59,055
I'm not inheriting anything. I'm on probation for a month.

581
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,714
Probation? It's not like you'll be fired.

582
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:06,184
He can get fired if the store goes under.

583
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:09,454
- Stop that. - What? He needs to know.

584
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,845
His mom is struggling so much by herself...

585
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:14,015
with the renewal and whatnot, trying to survive.

586
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:17,345
I'm nervous that I won't get my paycheck this month.

587
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:18,414
She's right.

588
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:21,294
We've been in the red.

589
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:23,845
If it isn't in the black within a month,

590
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,124
he's fired.

591
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:26,334
You never told me that.

592
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,555
You didn't, but I'll work hard.

593
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:33,455
What's the reason for our decrease in sales?

594
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:34,714
Quick Delivery.

595
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:36,495
Speedy Delivery.

596
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:38,004

599
00:42:41,504 --> 00:42:42,774
How can we beat them?

600
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:45,354
Quit right now if you don't think you can do it.

601
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:46,615
I was wondering how to beat them.

602
00:42:46,615 --> 00:42:49,245
Good. You need to beat them.

603
00:42:49,544 --> 00:42:51,564
You're not the golden boy, it's fake gold.

604
00:42:55,425 --> 00:42:58,055
Anyway, have you heard from Fish?

605
00:42:58,055 --> 00:42:59,325
Did you call?

606
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:00,385
Don't ask me.

607
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:02,624
Just hire someone new.

608
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:04,564
We need a new delivery person too.

609
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:06,325
Don't be so mean.

610
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,934
You can't replace someone...

611
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:09,564
just because they go off the grid for a few days.

612
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:11,934
He was scouted.

613
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:14,635
What? By whom?

614
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:16,004
Where else?

615
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:18,954
Fresh Sashimi.

616
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:19,945
What?

617
00:43:20,345 --> 00:43:22,305
Those louses.

618
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,394
They make money selling their fish here...

619
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:25,575
and take our worker?

620
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,854
Exactly. How else do you think it happened?

621
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:29,334
Oh my gosh.

622
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:34,595
Anyway, how do you always know everything?

623
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:36,765
The owner's wife uses our cosmetics.

624
00:43:38,434 --> 00:43:41,044
She always says she's too busy and tells me to go to their store.

625
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,925
And you let it happen?

626
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:44,714
What could I say? I'm not the boss.

627
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,035
Whoever pays more wins.

628
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:49,714
Why that...

629
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:52,365
That twerp. I'll make you pay.

630
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:54,414
- Mom. Can you breathe? - That...

631
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:56,584
Get back. Leave me alone.

632
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,854
Ms. Han. What's up?

633
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:07,055
Hi.

634
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:10,195
Remember that guy you mentioned last time?

635
00:44:10,195 --> 00:44:11,195
Yes.

636
00:44:11,365 --> 00:44:14,095
Yes. Bring him by so I can meet him.

637
00:44:14,104 --> 00:44:15,504

Thanks, Ms. Han.

640
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:23,584
But you'll give him the job no matter what, right?

641
00:44:23,575 --> 00:44:26,975
I'm desperate. I need the manpower.

642
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:29,285
Okay. I'll come to the supermarket now.

I worked super hard to lobby with the women's society,

647
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:47,564
so you'd better do a good job.

653

654

fresh vegetables to you at low prices.

Give me a minute.

662
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:52,644

Why do you always introduce ex-convicts for my store?

666
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:04,044
He has three priors!

667
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:06,754
How can I let him deliver shopping items for my customers?

668
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:09,535
Gosh. He'll be fine.

669
00:46:09,544 --> 00:46:12,184
Besides, he only committed theft.

670
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:14,624
- He didn't hurt anyone. - You...

671
00:46:14,754 --> 00:46:17,254
He can easily steal money or other things from the store.

672
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:18,995
This is like giving the cat the fish.

673
00:46:19,294 --> 00:46:21,294

It's an expensive one!

680
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:40,345
He's a nice kid.

681
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:42,015
Gosh. I don't need a nice kid.

682
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:45,055
Can you bring me a law-abiding kid instead of a nice kid?

683
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:48,055
He had his reasons too,

684

although I can't tell you.

685
00:46:50,385 --> 00:46:52,615
I'm sure you know it too. When your son was young...

686
00:46:52,624 --> 00:46:54,274
Why are you bringing up my son now?

687
00:46:56,794 --> 00:46:59,144

696
00:47:18,984 --> 00:47:20,964
you can deduct it from that. What do you think?

No. He meant he would kill you.

or from not being able to see you.

00:49:55,604 --> 00:49:57,984
I think they might break up for real this time.

729
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:00,015
Look at her.

730
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:02,414
Officer Do is determined this time.

731
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:05,455
- See you later. - Okay.

732
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:07,845
I'll see you tomorrow...

733
00:50:07,984 --> 00:50:09,394
if you don't mind selling fish.

734
00:50:09,684 --> 00:50:12,124
What? You're not hiring him to be a delivery guy?

735
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:13,925
I need to hire someone for the fish section first.

736
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:15,515
I'm good with that.

00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:19,285
Thanks, Ms. Han.

740
00:50:19,595 --> 00:50:20,725
Work hard.

741
00:50:23,035 --> 00:50:25,425
Not having any leftovers is key for the fish section.

742
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:26,734
So you need some sales skills.

743
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:29,035
I can do it.

744
00:50:29,774 --> 00:50:31,774
Sure. See you tomorrow.

745
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,285
What are you doing there? Get back to work.

Hello.

751
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,394
Are you our new delivery guy?

752
00:51:09,385 --> 00:51:10,445
No, I'll handle the fish section.

753
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:12,615
The fish section.

754
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:14,475
I see.

755
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:16,455
Ring them up, please.

756
00:51:17,794 --> 00:51:19,834
Just take them. It's my welcome gift to our team.

(This Alcohol)

758
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:48,394
I can't sell alcohol to minors.

759
00:51:48,555 --> 00:51:51,155
Don't you know my father? He runs Geumsung Realty.

760
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:53,195
I know your parents.

761
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:54,655
And I also know who you are.

762
00:51:54,964 --> 00:51:56,734
But I cannot sell soju to minors.

763
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:58,095
It's 6.69 dollars.

764
00:51:58,095 --> 00:52:00,905
If I can't buy soju, why would I want canned whelks?

765
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:08,265
Is that your phone?

766
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:10,805
It's my mom's.

767
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:11,905
What about your mom then?

768
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:19,475
You should dress properly.

769
00:52:21,024 --> 00:52:22,124
I'm not cold.

770
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:23,434
Even people who practice taekwondo can catch a cold.

771
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,325
But do you know whose slipper this is?

772
00:52:27,524 --> 00:52:28,704
Why did you bring it here?

773
00:52:28,695 --> 00:52:30,785
I didn't want to go to the police station...

774
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:32,104
for a slipper on the street.

775
00:52:32,564 --> 00:52:34,774
Can I put this at the lost-and-found here?

776
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:36,535
Why don't you...

777
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:38,914
put that in here?

778
00:52:40,774 --> 00:52:42,484
Do you think the owner will come back for it?

779
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:44,245
If the owner comes here to shop, I'll tell you.

780
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:45,975
Do you know whose it is?

781
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:51,084
Yes. I know everything.

782
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:53,754
- No way. - I'm serious.

783
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:57,245
You must not have heard yet. But people called me a genius...

784
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:59,434
Then why did you make that policewoman angry?

785
00:52:59,754 --> 00:53:01,294
You said you know everything.

786
00:53:01,294 --> 00:53:03,794
But you don't know a way not to get her angry?

787
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:07,394
No. It's not that.

788
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:08,834
Look who's here.

789
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:13,314
Here's a thing about people. Being smart doesn't mean...

790
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:16,035
you know what other people are feeling.

791
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:19,705
Well, there are times you don't even know how you feel.

792
00:53:22,644 --> 00:53:24,294
Aren't you cold?

793
00:53:24,655 --> 00:53:26,705
Yul, look at this.

794
00:53:26,714 --> 00:53:27,794
This is for you.

795
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:29,584
Thank you.

796
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:32,695
All right. Go on.

797
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:34,925
Bye.

799
00:53:42,734 --> 00:53:43,834
By the way,

800
00:53:44,504 --> 00:53:47,234
I haven't seen her mother for a while.

801
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,445
Did something happen to her?

802
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:51,265
The last time I saw her was summer.

803
00:53:52,115 --> 00:53:53,265
Does she shop at a different supermarket?

804
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:55,345
She's in the hospital.

805
00:53:55,684 --> 00:53:57,454
Where have you been?

806
00:53:57,814 --> 00:53:59,294
You were supposed to be working.

807
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:01,175
Something urgent came up.

808
00:54:02,484 --> 00:54:06,104
I guess whatever she has must be pretty serious.

809
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:08,964
Myung Sook, have you seen Cheon Kyu's face?

810
00:54:08,964 --> 00:54:11,104
He lost so much weight.

811
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:13,455
Right! I saw him on my way home yesterday.

812
00:54:13,535 --> 00:54:14,805
I saw him drinking at the real estate agency...

813
00:54:14,805 --> 00:54:16,135
all by himself.

814
00:54:17,104 --> 00:54:19,734
Don't you know he adores his wife?

815
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:22,504
He would do all the grocery shopping because she doesn't speak Korean.

816
00:54:22,774 --> 00:54:24,984
He even buys every type of cosmetic product...

817
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:27,365
including the concealer from me for every season.

818
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:29,905
He obviously loves his wife.

819
00:54:29,914 --> 00:54:31,984
Then how come he hasn't properly dressed his daughter?

820
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:35,484
Goodness. What do you expect from men?

821
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:36,934
Be quiet!

822
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,425
Stop chit-chatting. Get back to work!

823
00:54:43,124 --> 00:54:44,704

824
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:50,874
Yes, Mr. Cho.

825
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:56,914
Well, we haven't sold everything yet.

826

We don't need to order more for this week.

827
00:55:01,115 --> 00:55:03,205
Well, yes. I guess.

828
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:05,075
It's not selling as well as I hoped.

829
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:09,464
There's been a drop in our sales lately.

830
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:15,225
Yes. Okay. I'll skip this week. I'll order more next week.

831
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:16,785

832
00:55:17,365 --> 00:55:18,695

835
00:55:25,635 --> 00:55:26,765
Who's that?

836
00:55:26,774 --> 00:55:28,484
You know, the one who works at the kindergarten.

837
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:30,484
Which kindergarten teacher?

838
00:55:30,475 --> 00:55:31,705
The youngest one.

839
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:33,874

840

You're right.

842
00:55:38,184 --> 00:55:39,684
I haven't seen her in a while.

843
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:41,115
Why is that?

844
00:55:41,354 --> 00:55:42,434
Isn't it obvious?

845
00:55:43,254 --> 00:55:44,934

We must get our regulars back to bring sales back up.

851
00:56:01,745 --> 00:56:02,745
I'll get them back.

852
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:04,345
How?

853
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:07,015

857
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:16,964
You hate that.

858
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:18,825
I do. It's too sweet.

859
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,394

860
00:56:23,995 --> 00:56:25,225
It's their marketing strategy.

861
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:26,964

864

go with affection, then.
