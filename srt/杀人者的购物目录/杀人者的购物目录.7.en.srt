00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,699
(Episode 7)

00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:02,309
(MS Mart)

5
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,220
(MS Mart)

6
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:34,139
I want to pay.

7
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,440
We're closed.

8
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Wait.

9
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,510
That's stupid.

10
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,849
You're open for another hour.

11
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,619
It's okay, you can still shop.

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,920
He's blacklisted.

13
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:47,919
Oh, okay.

14
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,489
Give me your basket.

15
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,459
- Hey! - "Hey"?

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,660
I'll come back another time.

17
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,599
Will you?

18
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,859
You're shopping for Yul, aren't you?

19
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,899
She bought the exact same stuff but paid and left without it.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,140
Did she? Then I'll take that with me.

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,710
Don't worry. Dae Sung just left to take it to her.

22
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:11,709
She's at your office, isn't she?

23
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,710
Yes.

24
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,550
But...

25
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,550
Yes?

26
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,989
I don't want your son to get too close to my daughter.

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,920
May I ask why you say that?

28
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,459
Yul's a little girl and seeing how the world is these days,

29
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,359
I get worried.

30
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,429
You heard the news, then?

31
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,900
That his son was questioned by the police?

32
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:39,339
I saw everything, you see.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,240
He pushed the women's society chairwoman from the fourth floor.

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,710
I just got back from giving the police my statement.

35
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,479
You didn't see anything.

36
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:51,949
He did this.

37
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:56,089
He pointed a glue gun at her face like this.

38
00:02:57,149 --> 00:03:00,259
I don't have to see to know what happened.

39
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,590
Darn you.

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,590
Shoot.

41
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,390
(Carrot, Cabbage, Sweet pumpkin, Onion)

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Do you see this scar here?

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,000
His son did this to me.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,870
He cracked my skull.

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,810
I almost died that night.

46
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,439
Get out. Leave before I crack your skull again.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,750
What? Do it! I dare you!

48
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,620
I have a witness.

49
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,090
Dad and son can go hand-in-hand to prison.

50
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,420
- Crack my skull again! - Wait.

51
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,359
You said your son went to see Yul.

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,530
Are you sure it's to deliver stuff?

53
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,860
Of course it is.

54
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,330
Don't believe what he says.

55
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,030
Mr. Seo.

56
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,099
Come on.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,570
You... Get out of here.

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,040
- Get out of here. Now. - Darn it.

59
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,380
I know you didn't do it.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,190
How do you know that?

61
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,120
Did you really see something that night?

62
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,270
It's okay, Yul. Nothing bad will happen.

63
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,500
So tell me everything.

64
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,270
About what?

65
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,039
These blisters.

66
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,949
Did your dad cause them?

67
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,330
Why are you bothering her?

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,930
Let me warn you. Don't approach my daughter again.

69
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,599
And don't go to his supermarket now.

70
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,040
- Why? - You show too much interest in her!

71
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,380
- Why... - Are you worried I might know...

72
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,710
- you've been hurting her if I do? - No!

73
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,749
My dad didn't hurt me.

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,050
Hurt her?

75
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,250
Yul. What is he talking about?

76
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,720
- Are you hurt? - Dad. Let's go home now.

77
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,590
Yul. You don't have to be scared.

78
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,960
You can be safe.

79
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,099
If you want, you can come with me, not your dad.

80
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:21,259
You know the cop lady, right?

81
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,570
I can make sure your dad never hurts you again.

82
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,770
You don't have to live with him.

83
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,010
What are you...

84
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,140
What's this about?

85
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,440
What is it?

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,090
What? What's going on here? Cheon Kyu.

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,360
What happened? Did you two fight?

88
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,660
I think he's been hurting Yul.

89
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,759
But she can't tell the truth.

90
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,529
What...

91
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,200
(Deposit-based Listing, Urgent Sale)

92
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,670
Yul.

93
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,549
Let's go for now. Okay?

94
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:17,149
(Deposit-based Listing, Urgent Sale)

95
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,619
You jerk!

96
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,260
- You... I'll kill you! - Hey!

97
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,130
- How dare you? - You jerk.

98
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:28,799
You con artist.

99
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,729
I'm better than you.

100
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,400
You live off your wife.

101
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,539
You jerk. You said you would let me sing the theme song...

102
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,209
if I exclusively sold your toys. Didn't you say that to me?

103
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,179
Not only did you trample on my desire to be a musician,

104
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,880
but you also called my son a murderer.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,450
I didn't accuse anyone.

106
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,979
- I just told the truth. - You jerk.

107
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,420
I just told what I saw. I was released...

108
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,060
after the cop questioned me at the station.

109
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,220
Of course, you should be at the station.

110
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,690
You're the murderer, aren't you?

111
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,900
Why did they release you? Is that cop your cousin?

112
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,529
I was released because your son was the culprit.

113
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,639
You leech!

114
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,439
What? You called me a leech?

115
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,739
You jerk! My gosh.

116
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,349
- Hey. - You jerk.

117
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,449
- How dare you run your mouth? - Darn it.

118
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,019
You...

119
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,189
You jerk. I'm going to use this carrot...

120
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,899
to stab your neck!

121
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,830
I'm going to kill you with this.

122
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,570
(MS Mart)

123
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:47,339
Oh, no.

124
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,549
Come on.

125
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,689
(MS Mart)

126
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,219
You little...

127
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,030
Darn you.

128
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,359
Move out of my way!

129
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,030
- What was that? - That jerk!

130
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,069
Hey.

131
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,170
Honey.

132
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,739
My goodness. What happened to you?

133
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:18,269
Did he beat you up like this?

134
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,909
That jerk! Oh, no.

135
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,609
Your good looks are all you have. How could he do this to you?

136
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,019
- That little... - Mom.

137
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,549
- Boss. - Gosh. Come on.

138
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,890
My good looks aren't all I have.

139
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,560
I have you.

140
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,019
Look at your face. Oh, no.

141
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,990
Come on.

142
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,459
Sit down.

143
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,799
How come you guys are coming in together?

144
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,370
Did something happen?

145
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,230
What happened to your hand?

146
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,699
Oh, this...

147
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,010
- Who are you? - Hey.

148
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,010
He's on a mission right now.

149
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,810
- He's on a mission. - Is that Fish?

150
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,079
He's Fish.

151
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,280
What?

152
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,019
- He's super pretty. - I just picked them up...

153
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,050
from the police substation.

154
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,049
The substation...

155
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,060
- The substation? - The substation?

156
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,860
We caught Veggie's stalker.

157
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,400
My goodness. Why your face?

158
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,399
Not your face. Your face should stay pristine.

159
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,870
Okay.

160
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,679
I'm not sure if I should say you're lucky.

161
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:31,149
We confirmed that your ex-husband wasn't the murderer.

162
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,479
He was in the Philippines around the time of the murder.

163
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,649
But when you were living with him, did you find anything unusual...

164
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,359
about him before and after the murder?

165
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,160
He was violent only toward me.

166
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,260
People who knew him said he was a gentleman.

167
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,469
That's so typical of abusive husbands!

168
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,469
You should have told me to help you.

169
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,240
So what are you going to do now?

170
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,849
I called my mom.

171
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,950
I really didn't want to tell her.

172
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,090
I'll stay with my mom for the time being.

173
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,860
(Park So Hee, Meonji's owner)

174
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,870
Hello.

175
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,370
Meonji again?

176
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,100
- Come on. - Are you okay?

177
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:03,669
Give me your hand.

178
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,010
(MS Mart)

179
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,510
Why are you being nice?

180
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,120
Do you feel bad about suspecting me?

181
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,690
No. Why would I suspect you?

182
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,820
You did.

183
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,089
You asked me if I was the culprit this morning.

184
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,260
Oh, that? I was still dreaming. I was half asleep.

185
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,229
Other people could've suspected me, but not you.

186
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,600
Even when the cops suspected you, I never suspected you.

187
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,630
How could you?

188
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,399
Forget it.

189
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,380
Thanks to that, we were able to keep Veggie safe.

190
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,180
And her ex-husband will be punished too.

191
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,150
But I'm really disappointed.

192
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,249
I told you I didn't.

193
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,119
I knew you weren't the culprit.

194
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,950
You're saying that now? After you confirmed everything?

195
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,420
No. Even before that.

196
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,089
I found Products more suspicious...

197
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,130
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

198
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,190
You think she killed people?

199
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,130
I get that being a suspect is hard on you.

200
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,629
But you shouldn't do that.

201
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,630
No. She seems suspicious in many ways. She has a motive too.

202
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,510
Today, I saw her with a man...

203
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,539
- Get a grip. - What?

204
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,639
- We don't have time to waste here. - What?

205
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,939
(Hae Palace)

206
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,220
Yul.

207
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,790
Yes?

208
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:37,929
Come and sit down here.

209
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,369
What were you and the supermarket guy talking about?

210
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,910
I know everything.

211
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,109
I'm not asking because I don't know.

212
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,680
I want to see if you're lying.

213
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,289
I told you not to do that.

214
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:06,689
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,520
What did you talk about?

216
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,229
He asked if you hurt me.

217
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,760
So what did you say?

218
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,330
I said no.

219
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,630
You heard me too.

220
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,169
Where are we going?

221
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,580
Not you, just me.

222
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,009
Don't leave the house...

223
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,080
until I call you.

224
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,220
Where are you going?

225
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,049
To Mom.

226
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:40,119
To Mom?

227
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,790
Do you want to go too?

228
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,330
Yes.

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,760
Where's Mom's phone?

230
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,700
You always wore it.

231
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:55,299
I lost it.

232
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,810
Get up.

233
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,509
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,510
Now.

235
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,220
This is why I'm not taking you to Mom.

236
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,189
You don't deserve to see her.

237
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,889
You hang out with people I told you not to.

238
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:15,259
You lost the precious item, and you lied to me.

239
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,129
Do you know what you are?

240
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,160
Useless and mean.

241
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,459
Why can't Mom live with us?

242
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,630
Because of me.

243
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,099
Because I didn't behave.

244
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,763
(MS Mart)

245
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:54,373
(MS Mart)

246
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,073
Oh, no.

247
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:10,854
Always by our side Happy, happy MS

248
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,624
What's she putting on?

249
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:20,964
Reliable MS Our family MS

250
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:25,734
Filled with smiles MS Mart

251
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:29,744
Hi. You're early.

252
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:31,604
It looks like a flyer with a picture.

253
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:32,613
What?

254
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,143
Look carefully.

255
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:38,143
(Looking for Meonji)

256
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,513
- I'll see you inside. - Yes.

257
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:40,514
(Please call this number if you've seen this dog.)

258
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:42,254
(MS Mart)

259
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,823
Someone lost a dog.

260
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,993
You'll get 1,000 dollars if you find the dog.

261
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,493
My goodness.

262
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:52,263
She'd do anything for money.

263
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:53,264
That's not it.

264
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,563
If it was for money, she wouldn't put that up here.

265
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,833
Oh, you're right.

266
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,333
She'd take it off the wall...

267
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,403
and look for the dog alone.

268
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,574
- What's wrong with you? - Get up.

269
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:04,573
What are you doing? Seriously.

270
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,374
That's it. The women's society chairwoman election.

271
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:10,883
Right. That's it.

272
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:17,024
Boss. You should look for the dog when you're on delivery.

273
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,824
Whose dog is it? Someone you know?

274
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,554
No. It's just...

275
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:24,624
You'll get 1,000 dollars if you find it.

276
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,093
Money doesn't grow on trees.

277
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:31,663
Right. You'd even look for a stranger's dog.

278
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,734
The neighbours will be happy.

279
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:35,974
They were always happy.

280
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,413
Hey. Wait.

281
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:46,154
Bring the boxes.

282
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,154
Hurry.

283
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:51,753
Is this really necessary?

284
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,524
I don't think it's her.

285
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:54,994
We still need to check.

286
00:17:58,194 --> 00:17:59,764
What's this?

287
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:02,194
Why is she carrying this with her?

288
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,064
Is there anything more suspicious?

289
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:05,534
You know, like a weapon or something.

290
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:06,803
No.

291
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:10,643
What's this?

292
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:14,274
She's coming.

293
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,684
Hey. Seriously.

294
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:21,153
- Ra Hee. - What?

295
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,884
Aren't you hungry? Do you want some red bean buns?

296
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,954
What's gotten into you?

297
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:29,824
I had pork belly for breakfast.

298
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,404
Come on. What are you doing?

299
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,103
Get out of my way.

300
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:53,413
Yes, Mr. Jang.

301
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:56,823
When are the products coming?

302
00:18:57,424 --> 00:19:00,054
We need it now.

303
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:01,524
Yes.

304
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:03,793
Thank you.

305
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:18,344
I can't do it anymore.

306
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:20,673
I...

307
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,513
forced myself to get up this morning,

308
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,344
but now that I'm here,

309
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:27,313
I don't think I can do it.

310
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,283
I don't feel good.

311
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:30,684
Is that so?

312
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:32,424
How?

313
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,993
I think I'm getting a fever.

314
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,863
Let me take a day off.

315
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,133
Can I do that?

316
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,904
It's not that busy anyway.

317
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:49,373
Sure.

318
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:51,404
Go ahead.

319
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:53,414
Thanks.

320
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,013
(MS Mart)

321
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,493
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

322
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,193
It's okay.

323
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:17,133
Sorry about your clothes.

324
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:18,534
I know.

325
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:21,474
Let's switch.

326
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,044
If you give me your number,

327
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,303
I'll clean your coat and give it back to you.

328
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,573
There's no need.

329
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:30,914
Where's Meonji?

330
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:33,613
What? Meonji?

331
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:36,323
The dog. Pomeranian, Meonji.

332
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:39,183
Your ex-girlfriend's dog.

333
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,523
Oh, Meonji.

334
00:20:41,524 --> 00:20:43,894
Right. Her dog's name was Meonji.

335
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:46,563
Why are you asking me?

336
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:49,033
I know you took him.

337
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,403
Then search my house.

338
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,603
Gosh. What a day.

339
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,044
The police in our country are so easy.

340
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:58,174
They spend their morning looking for a dog.

341
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:00,974
There was a murder in this town only recently.

342
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,484
What could a policewoman do anyway?

343
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:08,353
Jo Joon Ho. You're under arrest for special larceny.

344
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:16,064
You have a right to an attorney.

345
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:17,864
You have a right to explain yourself.

346
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:20,963
Where's Meonji?

347
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:22,564
He wasn't in your house.

348
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:25,103
My arm! I hurt my arm just yesterday.

349
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,573
It won't kill you.

350
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:27,933
Where's Meonji?

351
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,504
I don't know.

352
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:33,244
You better help us find Meonji to relieve the situation.

353
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:35,774
I really don't!

354
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:39,214
My girlfriend...

355
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:45,084
reported that I kidnapped Meonji.

356
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:46,254
Do you have evidence?

357
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:48,154
You broke up. She's your ex.

358
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:49,924
Why are you talking casually?

359
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:52,424
Can a civil servant speak casually to a civilian?

360
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:56,664
Oh, well. I tend to talk to myself.

361
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,573
What do you know about our relationship?

362
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:02,273
Who do you think you are to barge in?

363
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:04,504
We didn't break up. It was just a fight.

364
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,344
Besides, Meonji...

365
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:09,783
got out because she never closes the door.

366
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:12,413
I kept telling her to be careful.

367
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:17,754
This is where Meonji and your ex-girlfriend live.

368
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:20,824
And here.

369
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:29,434
Here.

370
00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:36,474
Here.

371
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:41,674
Lastly, here is where Meonji was found.

372
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:44,214
They all filmed you...

373
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,683
grabbing Meonji by the scruff like this,

374
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,583
and walking along in a very suspicious manner!

375
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:54,124
So what? What about it?

376
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,693
I'll pay the fine.

377
00:22:57,123 --> 00:22:58,863
Where is Meonji?

378
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:00,393
I really don't know!

379
00:23:00,694 --> 00:23:03,304
Didn't the camera film me get robbed?

380
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:06,704
I just missed the darn dog.

381
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,503
I was going to return it to So Hee.

382
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,584
But some mad woman pushed me down.

383
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:22,853
Darn it...

384
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:26,194
I lost the dog!

385
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:31,963
How strange...

386
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:35,963
It's just too strange.

387
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:37,163
What is?

388
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:39,534
Oh. Here, take a look.

389
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:47,243
At this?

390
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:48,713
What?

391
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:55,283
That's a strange photo as well but not that. This.

392
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:58,954
The dead kindergarten teacher bought makeup from Products.

393
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:01,153
What about Kyung A?

394
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:03,664
Not her.

395
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:07,934
This is a bit far-fetched to call proof.

396
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,504
Look at this.

397
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:13,074
These red signs.

398
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:15,973
And here too.

399
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:18,203
What are these?

400
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:21,474
I don't know. Let's take a look.

401
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:26,083
(Jung Yu Jin)

402
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,113
(Customer Record)

403
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:29,013
(Total purchase: 105 dollars 75 cents)

404
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,953
(Jang Ye Won)

405
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,593
(Go Da Mi)

406
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:35,893
They all live alone.

407
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:37,064
How can you tell?

408
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:39,363
They don't buy much or come often.

409
00:24:39,393 --> 00:24:42,293
And look, they take ages to accumulate points.

410
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:45,863
Most of the stuff they buy are packed for small households.

411
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:49,203
And this person and this person...

412
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:51,273
are regulars.

413
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,803
They definitely live alone.

414
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:55,374
Why did she draw a red asterisk...

415
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:58,044
next to the names of people who live alone?

416
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:01,883
That's my point. And this person here has two.

417
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,023
You're right.

418
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:06,054
This won't do. I should visit her.

419
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:07,593
And say what?

420
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:09,764
Whatever the reason,

421
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,263
she has two asterisks.

422
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:13,664
Doesn't that mean Products already did...

423
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:15,033
whatever it is she does?

424
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:18,804
I'm sure I'll find out something if I ask a few questions.

425
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,303
See you.

426
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,243
Take care.

427
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,174
Meonji. Where are you?

428
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:32,283
Meonji.

429
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:35,954
Where did it get to?

430
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:37,383
Oh, dear.

431
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:40,854
This is it. This is the alley.

432
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:43,423
Meonji.

433
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:45,664
Meonji.

434
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:49,463
Meonji.

435
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:53,334
Meonji.

436
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:57,344
Meonji.

437
00:25:57,404 --> 00:25:58,744
Where are you?

438
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,983
(Looking for Meonji)

439
00:26:08,684 --> 00:26:11,254
(Looking for Meonji)

440
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:14,353
Where on earth did it get to?

441
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:19,094
Hey.

442
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,003
- Were you following me? - What?

443
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,403
Why?

444
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:28,274
You'd been acting weird since yesterday.

445
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:32,904
I was looking for the dog.

446
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:34,844
A thousand dollars cover my rent for three months.

447
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,213
Hand over the dog.

448
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:37,984
No! I found it!

449
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:39,084
Hand it over!

450
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:42,453
Meonji.

451
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:44,683
Darn you.

452
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,794
Where are you going?

453
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:50,793
Go away. Stay away from me!

454
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,663
(Looking for Meonji)

455
00:26:57,404 --> 00:26:59,264
Are you the person who called?

456
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:01,434
Did you see my dog?

457
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:05,104
No, well, you see,

458
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:09,513
I'm from... You know MS Mart, right?

459
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:11,283
- I... - Wait!

460
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:12,483
I found it.

461
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:14,953
Meonji!

462
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:16,683
Meonji.

463
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:19,484
Are you all right?

464
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:22,494
- Thank you so much. - You...

465
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,424
I found it first.

466
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:26,024
Thank you.

467
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:28,794
Give me your account number, and I'll compensate you.

468
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,133
Do you have a pen and paper? Modu Bank 081...

469
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,903
Forget about the money!

470
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:35,433
I feel sorry for the poor girl.

471
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:39,373
It's fine. I found the dog, so relax and go home.

472
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:42,274
He might come back, so be careful.

473
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:44,013
Did you call the police?

474
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,043
Thank you.

475
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:47,814
Go on home.

476
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:51,754
- What's all that about? - What were you going to say?

477
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:53,853
Oh, well...

478
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:57,824
You won't be in the right mind to chat.

479
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:59,864
I'll come back some other time.

480
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:02,333
I'm so happy for you that you found your dog.

481
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,863
You got it back.

482
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,233
Why are you here, boss?

483
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:09,874
Oh, well... Yes, the dog. To find the dog,

484
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:12,344
I thought I should know about it,

485
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:14,073
- so I wanted to ask her stuff. - Yes.

486
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:16,344
Thank you all so much.

487
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:20,014
Joon Ho's at the police station.

488
00:28:20,514 --> 00:28:22,714
He said he'll sue you.

489
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:25,223
For pushing him down and taking Meonji.

490
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,523
I'm sorry to get you in trouble.

491
00:28:27,654 --> 00:28:28,794
Tell him to sue me.

492
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:31,194
As if Do Crazy would believe him.

493
00:28:31,524 --> 00:28:32,764
- What? - What?

494
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,594
He's my ex-boyfriend.

495
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:37,364
He stalked me and threatened me,

496
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:39,404
and kept taking my dog.

497
00:28:39,404 --> 00:28:41,704
Then the man she pushed down yesterday was...

498
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:43,274
You saw that too?

499
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:45,803
What have you been up to?

500
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:49,613
Because I kept stepping out,

501
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:52,284
did your mom put you on my tail?

502
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:55,314
I did not.

503
00:28:57,184 --> 00:29:00,354
- The friend from last time. - Who?

504
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:01,593
- Eun Young? - Yes.

505
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:04,463
She wants to meet you for a meal to say thanks.

506
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:08,164
You met her after she got off work late and walked her home.

507
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,264
She doesn't have to thank me for that.

508
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:12,633
I walked her home that night...

509
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:15,174
which is why I saw that mess.

510
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:16,304
What?

511
00:29:16,303 --> 00:29:18,173
It's nothing. You don't need to know.

512
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:19,603
- Go on home. - Bye.

513
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:20,713
Go on.

514
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:23,414
Call me if the police want a statement.

515
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:24,784
Thank you.

516
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:25,983
- Bye. - See you.

517
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:28,314
- Stay safe, Meonji. - Bye, Meonji.

518
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:29,953
My gosh...

519
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,723
What? Wait for me!

520
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,894
Then...

521
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:40,793
the red asterisks next to the names of...

522
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:43,433
- people who live alone... - Is to provide a service.

523
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:44,834
To know my customers' needs.

524
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:47,504
Is that so?

525
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,573
How are you like that, though?

526
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:51,444
Like what?

527
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:54,873
You'd put an asterisk next to Kwon Bo Yeon's name.

528
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:57,444
You cared that much about her and now that she's dead,

529
00:29:57,444 --> 00:30:00,054
you're going to such lengths to try to get the place for cheap?

530
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:01,783
Don't you feel bad?

531
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:04,124
That's different.

532
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:07,094
The killer's to blame, not the apartment.

533
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:12,194
That's why I care for the women who live alone more than others.

534
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:13,763
So bad things won't happen.

535
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:16,434
Yes, of course you do.

536
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:17,564
Hang on.

537
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:22,334
I answered your questions but now I have questions.

538
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:23,943
About what?

539
00:30:24,974 --> 00:30:27,844
How do you know about the asterisks in my notebook?

540
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:35,813
And you've been following me everywhere since yesterday.

541
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,354
That I'd been working on Yul's dad.

542
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:42,924
How did you know that?

543
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:52,004
Did you suspect me?

544
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:53,433
As the killer?

545
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,334
- No. Why would we? - No.

546
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:56,744
- Goodness. - What for?

547
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:58,874
You suspected innocent me?

548
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,213
My gosh.

549
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:04,413
Who, me?

550
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:12,854
Oh, come on. If you're going to suspect someone, do a better job.

551
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,794
You're no good at all.

552
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,593
If you want to find the killer, find that first.

553
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:21,993
The drain cleaner.

554
00:31:21,994 --> 00:31:23,064
What for?

555
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:26,463
I found the chairwoman lying on the ground.

556
00:31:27,974 --> 00:31:30,974
And I smelled something on her.

557
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:33,944
Bleach with a hint of pine tree.

558
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:35,674
- Quick... - Quick Drain Cleaner.

559
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:38,414
Yes, that. You know that sells the least, right?

560
00:31:38,744 --> 00:31:39,844
Because it's too strong.

561
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:46,353
(Quick Drain Cleaner)

562
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:57,233
No. She wasn't drugged with chlorine gas.

563
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:01,134
But there were no signs of resistance or DNA.

564
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:04,744
She either fainted right away or was restrained when it happened.

565
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:08,214
There were lots of irregular bruises all over her body.

566
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:12,414
They think she fell while trying to get away after being blinded.

567
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:15,854
Then was she locked up where the smell was strong enough to stay?

568
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:18,754
That's possible.

569
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:22,453
No one from the store is guilty.

570
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:28,263
I thought the ex-boyfriend who took Meonji could be the killer,

571
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:30,133
but he has an alibi.

572
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:32,434
Are we thinking correctly?

573
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:36,003
I don't know.

574
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,973
The people we suspected are in the clear,

575
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:44,613
but we can't be certain that they aren't the culprits.

576
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,483
We need to go back to square one.

577
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:49,053
- For what? - Why did we start suspecting...

578
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:50,523
people from the supermarket?

579
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:53,354
Because they bought the items found at the crime scene...

580
00:32:53,353 --> 00:32:55,123
or the murder weapon.

581
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:56,123
Right.

582
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:58,963
If we include the glue gun and the Quick Drain Cleaner,

583
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:00,294
the list might change.

584
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:03,434
But Ms. Chairwoman's case is different...

585
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:04,904
from the other two victims.

586
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:08,974
The detectives think that her case isn't connected.

587
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:43,033
I got it.

588
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:47,944
Yes!

589
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,083
Honey.

590
00:33:57,254 --> 00:33:59,124
Not that. Please give it back.

591
00:33:59,123 --> 00:34:00,493
Should you be playing games right now?

592
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:03,523
I get it. I heard you, so please give it back now.

593
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:06,694
Why? What will you do with this? Will you cook with this?

594
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,464
I want to give it to Yul as a present.

595
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,764
What? Gosh. Forget it. This is mine!

596
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,904
Come on. Give it back now!

597
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:16,474
See if you can catch it.

598
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:18,174
Give it back!

599
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:19,743
See if you can catch it.

600
00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:20,743
Stop right there!

601
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:23,814
Honey! Give it back.

602
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:26,413
Honey.

603
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:29,614
Are you going on a trip?

604
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:30,884
No.

605
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:32,423
Then where are you going?

606
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:35,893
My wife isn't doing well.

607
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:38,723
I need to be at the hospital for a few days.

608
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:41,533
Then you'll close your office?

609
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:42,734
Yes.

610
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:44,063
What about Yul?

611
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:49,704
If you leave her alone, it's neglectful parenting.

612
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:50,703
Hey.

613
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:52,874
Stop paying attention to her.

614
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:54,914
Her grandmother took her.

615
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:58,344
Her grandmother.

616
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:01,553
Why are you leaving today as if you're running away?

617
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:02,884
You even packed a suitcase.

618
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:04,954
- Why go to the hospital today? - Run away?

619
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:07,854
Do you think I hurt my own daughter?

620
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:10,563
And I'm running away because you caught me?

621
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:12,793
What's wrong with Yul's mother?

622
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:15,933
Why must I tell you that?

623
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,363
Where is her hospital? I want to visit her.

624
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:19,904
You asked him, but he wouldn't tell you.

625
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:21,733
Is she really hospitalized?

626
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,503
I don't know why you all want to visit her in the hospital.

627
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:30,514
Fine. Come see her. She's at Unheng Hospital.

628
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:34,984
- She's not in this hospital. - No?

629
00:35:34,984 --> 00:35:37,284
If she came to this hospital, I'd know.

630
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:39,624
No wonder she's sick with all that beating.

631
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:41,493
Hey.

632
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:49,533
- Honey. - Up here.

633
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,953
(Soap, Cleaning Wipes, Canned Mackerels...)

634
00:36:08,554 --> 00:36:11,854
I'm going to take this!

635
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:13,693
No way!

636
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:16,624
- See if you can catch me. - It's 148.9 dollars.

637
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:17,623
Honey!

638
00:36:24,563 --> 00:36:27,003
Here. Come get it!

639
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:31,604
I will continue to pay attention to Yul...

640
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:33,643
even if you move, instead of running away for a few days.

641
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:35,174
- I got you. - What?

642
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:36,913
I'll see to it that she's not hurt,

643
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,044
eats her meals,

644
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:41,713
dresses warmly,

645
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:45,224
and doesn't feel sad. I'll keep an eye on her.

646
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:48,853
Who do you think you are?

647
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:51,524
What did you say?

648
00:36:53,163 --> 00:36:54,333
Mind your own business...

649
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:57,133
unless you want to get arrested as a child molester.

650
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,003
You were just released from the station. Remember?

651
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:42,573
You're going to stick to a stakeout?

652
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:45,543
Detective Choi released him after questioning him.

653
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:47,653
So I can't barge in there anymore.

654
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:50,483
I need to follow the law and shouldn't cause trouble.

655
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,723
But it's obvious you're on a stakeout here.

656
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:57,364
Five Dollars will spot you even from the hallway.

657
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:58,963
That's great.

658
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,133
It's quiet here.

659
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:06,704
If he's the culprit...

660
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:10,134
and stays cooped up in his house knowing he can't do anything,

661
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:11,474
wouldn't that be the best outcome?

662
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:14,313
What are you talking about? Arresting him is the best outcome.

663
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:17,183
That will happen if Detective Choi does his job.

664
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:19,383
But this is my role.

665
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,583
Until when?

666
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:22,514
Until the culprit is caught.

667
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,642
Go on.

668
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,982
I'm doing my job too. Don't mind me.

669
00:38:57,383 --> 00:38:58,853
Anything from questioning Five Dollars yesterday?

670
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:04,053
The tool box was really there.

671
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,592
It wasn't a real tool box. It was like a paper box.

672
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:08,393
And it was covered up, so we didn't find it.

673
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:11,192
But other residents on the floor said they saw the box.

674
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:12,193
Listen.

675
00:39:12,863 --> 00:39:17,303
The glue gun. Look into that.

676
00:39:17,303 --> 00:39:20,373
This punk was wearing gloves...

677
00:39:20,372 --> 00:39:23,302
so there might not be his prints,

678
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:25,873
but my prints will definitely be on it.

679
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:28,612
It means he saw the culprit wearing gloves.

680
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,013
He was the first one to report it. Then he's an eyewitness.

681
00:39:32,182 --> 00:39:33,412
Did you find any other lead?

682
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,022
And that eyewitness singled you out as the culprit.

683
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:39,852
So if you have nothing to say, just get back to work.

684
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:43,562
Let me ask you one thing.

685
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:49,403
Did you conclude I was the culprit after your investigation?

686
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,772
Or do you want me to be the culprit?

687
00:39:54,943 --> 00:39:56,543
When I run investigations,

688
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:59,712
some people rub me up the wrong way.

689
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:02,482
I might have to take a detour, but my hunch is usually right.

690
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:05,683
I build data with my experience on the field.

691
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:07,652
He's not the culprit.

692
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:11,423
What?

693
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:14,193
Well,

694
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,762
do you know who the culprit is?

695
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:21,033
I only know that he's not the culprit.

696
00:40:22,062 --> 00:40:25,472
Mr. Detective, you need to do your job right.

697
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,542
Okay.

698
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,922
Yul, I thought you went to your grandmother's house.

699
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,833
My grandmother passed away.

700
00:40:50,892 --> 00:40:51,992
Then did he mean your maternal grandmother?

701
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:54,233
My maternal grandmother is in Vietnam.

702
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:56,632
Right. That sounds about right.

703
00:40:57,473 --> 00:40:59,173
Then your dad didn't go to see your mom in the hospital?

704
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:01,203
He left yesterday.

705
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:03,843
What about you? Did you sleep alone yesterday?

706
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:06,142
Yes. I'm good at that.

707
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:09,113
Has this happened before?

708
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:11,453
A few times.

709
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:13,953
I'm fine sleeping alone.

710
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,692
If your dad doesn't come back today, do you want to sleep with us?

711
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:22,163
You can sleep with my mom.

712
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:23,593
I'm good.

713
00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:26,963
You can't tell my dad that I came here.

714
00:41:26,993 --> 00:41:28,133
If you stay alone...

715
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:29,463
My dad told me that...

716
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:31,672
he would bring my mom home if I can be good on my own.

717
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:35,173
But among the dolls here...

718
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:37,573
What? Did you want something?

719
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:39,943
No one was supposed to get that.

720
00:41:39,943 --> 00:41:40,943
Which one?

721
00:41:44,113 --> 00:41:46,013
I'll give you my number. Give me your phone.

722
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:47,013
(MS Mart)

723
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:59,992
(Dae Sung)

724
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:03,032
Did you get a new phone?

725
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:04,673
Dad gave it to me before he left.

726
00:42:04,673 --> 00:42:05,903
What about the one you always wore on your neck?

727
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:09,743
That wasn't mine. That was my mom's.

728
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:11,342
I lost it.

729
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,183
If you tell me which one it is, I'll put the same one in there.

730
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:21,952
People barely play this, don't they?

731
00:42:22,252 --> 00:42:24,222
It seems like everything else is still there.

732
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:26,253
Do you know who won it?

733
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,392
Yes!

734
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:37,132
- Here. - Give it to me.

735
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:38,433
- Take it. - Give it back.

736
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,503
I think I know. I'll look into it.

737
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:44,912
When you call me tonight to tell me you're safe,

738
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:46,643
let's talk about it again.

739
00:42:47,783 --> 00:42:50,083
What if I can't call you?

740
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:51,353
What?

741
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:55,852
What if I'm sick or someone stops me from calling you?

742
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:02,763
Then just make a call.

743
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:05,792
If you don't say anything, I'll run to your house.

744
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:07,803
Come here.

745
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:17,943
What?

746
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:20,272
Here.

747
00:43:20,843 --> 00:43:22,013
Five zero five?

748
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:24,782
No, it's SOS.

749
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,983
- It's... - I know what this is.

750
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:30,352
I'm saying it looks like 505.

751
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:31,953
Okay.

752
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:34,523
Anyway, if you're sick or in trouble,

753
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:37,892
call me and blow the whistle for everyone else to hear you.

754
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,163
Can you do that?

755
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:46,073
My. Stay out of the way.

756
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,233
Geez.

757
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:51,472
Don't tell Dad I was here.

758
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,812
Yul. Wait.

759
00:43:59,852 --> 00:44:01,182
Here.

760
00:44:01,553 --> 00:44:02,853
It's for you.

761
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:07,922
Hello.

762
00:44:08,223 --> 00:44:10,163
- Hi, Yul. - Hello.

763
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:14,933
Oh, yes.

764
00:44:16,162 --> 00:44:17,802
It's for you.

765
00:44:20,002 --> 00:44:21,272
Do you like it?

766
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:23,972
You must be happy.

767
00:44:27,343 --> 00:44:28,443
Thank you.

768
00:44:32,312 --> 00:44:34,182
It must be nice.

769
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:46,332
Take it. It's okay.

770
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:49,562
Yul. It's your favourite.

771
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:51,573
It's not.

772
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:55,643
What? You always bought this every time you were here with your mom.

773
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:58,913
Because this was the only thing she could buy me...

774
00:44:58,912 --> 00:45:01,412
without Dad's permission.

775
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:03,542
Back then.

776
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,653
Yul.

777
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,922
My. I'm sorry. Are you okay?

778
00:45:08,982 --> 00:45:11,252
Let me see. Here.

779
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,022
Show me. It's okay.

780
00:45:13,022 --> 00:45:15,192
It's okay. You can show me.

781
00:45:15,193 --> 00:45:16,723
What's wrong?

782
00:45:17,122 --> 00:45:19,462
Show me. It's okay.

783
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:22,263
Just show me.

784
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:25,902
Mom. Get her changed.

785
00:45:25,903 --> 00:45:28,943
Dad will get mad when my clothes get dirty.

786
00:45:29,772 --> 00:45:32,012
I'll wash it for you.

787
00:45:33,473 --> 00:45:34,543
Oh, yes.

788
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:36,982
If you get changed to this,

789
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:39,712
I'll wash it clean for you.

790
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:41,782
This way. Let's go.

791
00:45:42,082 --> 00:45:43,352
Come with me.

792
00:45:44,622 --> 00:45:46,152
I'll wash it well for you.

793
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:54,403
Yul. Raise your hands. Good.

794
00:46:03,843 --> 00:46:04,943
I'm cold.

795
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:08,112
What? Yes.

796
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:10,482
Okay.

797
00:46:14,953 --> 00:46:16,023
Yul.

798
00:46:17,953 --> 00:46:19,623
I have a favour to ask you.

799
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:22,522
What is it?

800
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:26,693
Before you get changed,

801
00:46:27,093 --> 00:46:30,033
can I take a picture...

802
00:46:30,432 --> 00:46:31,972
of your wounds...

803
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:34,133
here and here?

804
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,972
Why?

805
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:42,542
Your face won't be in it.

806
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:46,552
I'll just take a picture of your wounds...

807
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:50,682
and show you.

808
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:53,923
If you say no, I won't show it to anyone.

809
00:46:54,153 --> 00:46:57,163
But...

810
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:59,032
you might have to...

811
00:47:00,462 --> 00:47:02,802
go to a hospital for treatment.

812
00:47:05,932 --> 00:47:08,072
So it will never happen again...

813
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:10,943
You don't have to help me.

814
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:14,043
What?

815
00:47:15,243 --> 00:47:18,853
I don't want to live in the orphanage.

816
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:22,282
Then I won't get to see Mom.

817
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:33,992
Yul.

818
00:47:35,303 --> 00:47:37,833
While I wash your clothes,

819
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:40,133
stay with the Part Timer, will you?

820
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:46,543
Did you eat?

821
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:08,962
We need to go to a hospital...

822
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:12,073
and check...

823
00:48:13,203 --> 00:48:14,903
if she's all right internally.

824
00:48:14,973 --> 00:48:16,303
How bad is it on the outside?

825
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:19,113
Bruises, burns,

826
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:23,942
and wounds.

827
00:48:24,883 --> 00:48:26,383
It didn't happen only once.

828
00:48:26,883 --> 00:48:28,183
Some are old.

829
00:48:29,982 --> 00:48:31,652
Some look new.

830
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:34,763
You can still punish him even if she doesn't want it, right?

831
00:48:36,693 --> 00:48:39,163
His wife got sick from his beating.

832
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:41,362
He said Yul's mom is in Unheng Hospital,

833
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:43,063
but we already checked she isn't.

834
00:48:44,803 --> 00:48:46,433
Why did you?

835
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:52,742
I wanted to visit her as a neighbour,

836
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:55,283
but he just won't tell me.

837
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:57,313
I happen to know one of the caregivers.

838
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:58,982
You can arrest Yul's dad, right?

839
00:48:59,113 --> 00:49:01,953
He might have stopped by here on purpose before running away.

840
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:03,952
There's no one to watch her.

841
00:49:05,622 --> 00:49:08,722
I'm in the middle of an investigation,

842
00:49:09,622 --> 00:49:10,892
and I'm not in charge.

843
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,963
Take it officially to the police.

844
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:16,762
Make sure to secure evidence.

845
00:49:16,763 --> 00:49:19,573
I can't just take a picture of her when she says no.

846
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:21,002
How am I...

847
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:23,742
supposed to secure evidence?

848
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:26,713
Fine. We'll take it to the police. We'll find evidence...

849
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:28,343
and find her dad ourselves.

850
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:29,712
But...

851
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:34,823
Hey. Dae Sung.

852
00:49:36,622 --> 00:49:37,722
Come with me.

853
00:49:39,653 --> 00:49:40,653
To where?

854
00:49:40,653 --> 00:49:41,793
You're in the middle of investigation.

855
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,062
And I'm your suspect.

856
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:45,732
Don't you want to know where I'm going?

857
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:49,532
(MS Mart)

858
00:49:53,633 --> 00:50:01,313
(MS Mart)

859
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:06,582
Look. I don't have time to play along with your hero game.

860
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:08,622
I told you to report the child abuse...

861
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:09,722
Excuse me.

862
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,493
(Geumsung Realty)

863
00:50:15,892 --> 00:50:17,962
What the heck are you doing?

864
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:27,233
My goodness.

865
00:50:33,712 --> 00:50:36,382
I'll call you when I find her.

866
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:38,413
Okay.

867
00:51:15,053 --> 00:51:16,923
There's one evidence of abuse.

868
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:19,152
- What? Her shoe? - No, the glue gun.

869
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,392
There's a blister on her body.

870
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:23,863
That's what you get when you get burned by a glue gun.

871
00:51:24,423 --> 00:51:25,763
There are toys.

872
00:51:25,993 --> 00:51:28,163
That might be from assembling the toys.

873
00:51:28,263 --> 00:51:29,763
Yul disappeared for a few days.

874
00:51:30,232 --> 00:51:33,002
When I found her, she looked like she was running away from something.

875
00:51:33,432 --> 00:51:34,842
She was barefoot and barely wearing clothes.

876
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:37,602
Are you okay? What about your shoes?

877
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,013
Are you hurt?

878
00:51:42,812 --> 00:51:44,042
Her shoes are here,

879
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,712
and there are signs that the glue gun was used.

880
00:51:47,783 --> 00:51:49,553
The wound on the dad's chin.

881
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:51,853
Thank you for helping me find her.

882
00:51:53,392 --> 00:51:54,392
What's this?

883
00:51:54,453 --> 00:51:56,693
It's way too early in the morning to deal with your madness!

884
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:59,133
I saw a similar cut on someone made by a glue gun.

885
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:03,303
Aren't you forcing the pieces together?

886
00:52:07,732 --> 00:52:10,642
Someone can hurt their chin in over a hundred ways.

887
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:12,673
Let's get out of here.

888
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:15,312
This is still trespassing even if you have me here with you.

889
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:21,823
How did you know she was missing and how did you find her?

890
00:52:21,823 --> 00:52:23,223
The day after Kwon Bo Yeon died,

891
00:52:23,622 --> 00:52:26,552
Yul brought one of Ms. Kwon's slippers to the store.

892
00:52:26,553 --> 00:52:28,223
Do you know whose it is?

893
00:52:28,223 --> 00:52:29,393
Why did you bring it here?

894
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:31,493
I didn't want to go to the police station...

895
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:33,033
for a slipper on the street.

896
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:36,033
She said she'd found it outside the church.

897
00:52:36,462 --> 00:52:38,502
When I went there, I found pantyhose.

898
00:52:40,473 --> 00:52:42,903
It was the day I saw the slipper in the lost and found box...

899
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:46,472
and told Yul's dad that she could be a witness.

900
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,242
After I found Yul,

901
00:52:49,243 --> 00:52:51,013
I asked where her shoes were.

902
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:53,713
Well, that... I actually asked her.

903
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,682
She was playing in a different neighbourhood today.

904
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:57,952
And some bullies must have gotten to her.

905
00:52:57,953 --> 00:52:59,593
They must have taken her shoes for kicks.

906
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:01,792
Anyway, I'm sorry to cause you concern.

907
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:02,792
Goodnight. Bye.

908
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,362
The kid. Did she say what she saw?

909
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:12,132
No. She only says I'm not the culprit.

910
00:53:12,872 --> 00:53:14,632
As if she knows who is.

911
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:16,973
She said that to me too.

912
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:20,713
But that's just because you're close.

913
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:23,343
What if it's her dad she saw?

914
00:53:25,312 --> 00:53:26,582
What if he knows she saw...

915
00:53:26,582 --> 00:53:28,222
and is threatening and abusing her?

916
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:30,453
Then doesn't it make sense that she can't say it?

917
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:34,753
- What? - It makes sense.

918
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:37,223
Yul's dad was the one who found Lee Kyung A's body.

919
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:40,033
He opened the door...

920
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:41,803
and my mom met him there and joined him.

921
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,603
He's a realtor.

922
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:46,202
He can get into any complex without people suspecting him.

923
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:48,343
He manages properties for landlords,

924
00:53:48,343 --> 00:53:49,773
and knows the door code.

925
00:53:49,772 --> 00:53:51,372
He could even have a master key.

926
00:53:51,973 --> 00:53:53,273
He also knows...

927
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:55,413
if a woman lives alone or with her family.

928
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:56,842
Wait.

929
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:58,383
What are you getting at?

930
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:01,982
Earlier you called Yul's dad an abuser and now he's a murderer?

931
00:54:01,982 --> 00:54:03,782
Do you think you can get out that way?

932
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:05,523
Please, just for once!

933
00:54:08,923 --> 00:54:10,823
Will you be serious and just listen?

934
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:13,293
Without concluding that I'm the culprit,

935
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:18,402

936
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:27,112
Okay, then. Go on. What else is there?

00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:29,783
The shopping list.

938
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,652
What?

939
00:54:31,912 --> 00:54:34,612
The Chocolate Pie. The soap bubble gun.

940
00:54:35,153 --> 00:54:37,283
Pantyhose, canned peaches, can opener.

941
00:54:37,283 --> 00:54:38,893
They're all available at our store.

942
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:42,263
The smell from the chairwoman's body...

943
00:54:42,263 --> 00:54:44,293
is the smell of Quick Drain Cleaner that we sell.

944
00:54:44,292 --> 00:54:45,732
Products confirmed it.

945
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:49,033
Glue guns and glue gun sticks. We sell those too.

946
00:54:50,232 --> 00:54:52,472
We suspected the people who had bought them all.

947
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:55,203
But we forgot one person.

948
00:54:57,073 --> 00:54:58,973
It just so happens that...

949
00:54:58,973 --> 00:55:00,843
Yul's dad bought all those too?

950
00:55:01,073 --> 00:55:02,083
Can you prove it?

951
00:55:03,482 --> 00:55:04,482
No.

952
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:07,413
Yul's dad bought some of the stuff.

953
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:11,483
Are you going to the hospital?

954
00:55:11,482 --> 00:55:12,922
- Yes. - Here you go.

955
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:15,563
- It's a present. - Thank you.

got for free,

961
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,782
or wanted...

962
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:41,413
though she couldn't get them.

963
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,873
The last thing the chairwoman said before getting into the ambulance.

964
00:56:07,243 --> 00:56:08,243
Do you remember?

965
00:56:09,982 --> 00:56:11,412
- G... - What?

966
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:13,312
G...

967

G...

968
00:56:16,852 --> 00:56:19,392
She made the G sound, many times.

969
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:22,422
You saw her face and the glue gun on the floor...

970
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:24,563
and thought she was trying to say "glue gun".

971
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:27,293
- Yes. - If...

972
00:56:34,002 --> 00:56:35,502
If you were her,

973
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,102
and someone tried to kill you,

974
00:56:38,243 --> 00:56:40,043
and you couldn't speak well,

975
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:44,112
would you try to name the murder weapon?

976
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:47,312
If I were her,

977
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,923
I think I'd try to name my attacker.

978
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:56,293
