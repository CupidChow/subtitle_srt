Dae Sung's not back yet.

00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:08,668
You're right.

16
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,068

Dae Sung left with Detective Choi.

They've been gone for hours.

What? Where did they go?

00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:28,018
I don't know where they went,

22
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,487
but are they at the...

23
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:30,487
Wait!

Then you come with me to check on Yul.

28

Officer Do. The sergeant is not your friend.

He's not picking up.

What do you mean?

61
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:05,577
Yul left the store a long time ago,

62
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,347
but she's not at home.

63
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:11,747

64
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:14,558
- It's... - Isn't it that drain cleaner?

65
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:17,818
Yes, that's it! Pine scented Quick Drain Cleaner.

I see the bottles.

I smelled it when I was here last time,

68
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:23,227
and I smell it now too.

What a nuisance.

I mean, I happened to come across her cell phone.

She almost died in that unit before the ambulance took her.

140
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:38,467
I saw her enter the unit next door.

141
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:43,578
The unit next door was vacant.

142
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,608
I found it odd that she went in, so I secretly followed her inside.

143
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:50,217
And I secretly took a photo.

144

I don't follow you at all.

154
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:28,488
I can tell the cops that the son of the supermarket lady...

155
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,358
is the culprit.

156
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:34,058
I can do that for you. Okay?

He left saying he was going to the supermarket.

189
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:13,788
He went there to put pressure on the cashier...

190
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,287
because he only had circumstantial evidence.

191
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,958
If he found a lead,

192
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,188
he wouldn't have proceeded without reporting it first.

193
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:23,197
Right. I'm bringing this up because he's not the type to do so.

194
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,167
What's going on?

195
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:30,998
Always by our side Happy, happy MS

196
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:33,208
This doesn't count as hiding.

197
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,208
Don't you think people will find it suspicious?

198
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,708
People always miss what's right in front of them.

199
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:40,448
I'm not hiding to evade the police.

200
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,017
I just need to figure out where the culprit is.

201
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:46,947
Finding the culprit is important. But we must find Yul too!

202
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,857
Right. We need to figure out where he is to find her.

203
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,357
You want to find the culprit in that box? How?

204
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:53,657
With magic?

205
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,798
No.

206
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:58,768
We tried to find the culprit by looking at our customers...

207
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,697
who bought the items that were used in the crimes.

208
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,937
I can't hear you at all.

209
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,238
Hold on.

210
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:11,277
Right here. Talk to me through here.

211
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,748
We need to figure out the location of the culprit...

212
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,117
from the items the culprit bought.

213
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:19,718
He knew that I was suspecting him for abusing Yul.

214
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,188
But he must have stopped by here to buy some stuff...

215
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,187
for a reason before he ran away.

216
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,257
Is that so?

217
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:29,827
- As for the things he bought... - What did he buy?

218
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:32,927
He didn't buy a lot.

219
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:36,367
He only bought instant food and so on.

220
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,167
My goodness. It's been a while.

221
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,468
It's been a week, right?

222
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,837
Hold on.

223
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,047
You buy all of your groceries for the week,

224
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,777
so you never have to leave the house?

225
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,917
My goodness. You should go outside, exercise,

226
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,817
and meet your friends.

227
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,117

228
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,457
- What? - Nothing.

229
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,518
Right.

230
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,017

Seo Cheon Kyu came back to his office yesterday.

245
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:36,928
As soon as the incident took place, he took Yul.

246
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:38,997
He never went far.

247
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,028
He's hiding in this neighborhood.

248
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:46,107
Don't you think he's hiding somewhere with the instant food?

254
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:19,067
I'm not hungry.

255
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:20,538
Once the hunting is successful,

256
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:22,538
they drag their prey someplace deep and drown it.

257
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,347
But you didn't eat anything today.

258
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,388
What if you get sick?

259
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,248
You'll die...

260
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:36,488
because you can't go to the hospital.

261
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,087
And I'm not a doctor.

262
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:46,567
Do you want to finish this or get punished for an hour?

If he's the only one who saw what he shouldn't have seen,

264
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:03,517
I'd be relieved.

I'll go to prison, and you'll go to the orphanage.

that the empty house was using electricity.

364

00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:12,792
No, it's SOS.

372
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:16,062
- It's... - I know what this is.

373
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,232
I'm saying it looks like 505.

374
00:26:18,392 --> 00:26:19,402
What?

375
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:20,561
It's Yul.

376
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:51,362
We should check the site first...

377
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,461
If what he said is true,

378
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:55,062
the serial killer took the kid as a hostage.

379
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:56,071
What if it's not?

380
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:57,802
Then Dae Sung will be arrested.

381
00:26:57,801 --> 00:26:59,301
We'll also be in trouble.

382
00:26:59,672 --> 00:27:01,102
I'm retiring soon,

383
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:03,172
but will you be okay if you get fired?

384
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:06,842
Let's check the site first.

385
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:10,881
Listen to me this once for goodness' sake.

386
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:13,782
Then let's go through the back.

387
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:16,092
He isn't likely to open the door.

388
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:18,522
He's probably focusing on that.

389
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:24,161
Right here.

390
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:25,632
Yul.

391
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:27,261
- Yul? - Yul.

392
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:28,331
Let me try.

393
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,001
Yul?

394
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:41,382
Yul?

395
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:45,212
Yul?

396
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:49,692
Yul.

397
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,292
Yul.

398
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:52,861
Yul.

399
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:58,832
Shoot.

400
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:01,462
- Yul. - Yul.

401
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:03,901
Yul.

402
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:05,701
Yul.

403
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:08,802
Yul.

404
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:11,671
- Yul. - Is no one in?

405
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:13,941
Yul!

406
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,352
- Hey, you made it. - Open up!

407
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:19,381
We must get in.

408
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:21,951
Seo Yul!

409
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:28,691
Yul.

410
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:39,941
You know how to break in?

411
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:41,872
I learned how but I'm not good at it.

412
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,181
Yul. Sweetie.

413
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:53,852
What are you doing?

414
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:57,451
You know what happens if you don't listen to me, don't you?

415
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:03,261
Open the door.

416
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:04,392
Open...

417
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:06,862
Open the door.

418
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:35,891
Open the door.

419
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:55,012
Hurry up.

420
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:57,582
I'm trying okay?

421
00:29:57,882 --> 00:29:58,952
Give me a while.

422
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:00,882
Does anyone have a flashlight? It's too dark.

423
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:23,472
(Police)

424
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:24,632
Okay.

425
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,341
Fish is trying to break in but there's no sign anyone's in.

426
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:31,872
What's that up there?

427
00:31:31,872 --> 00:31:33,042
Yul!

428
00:31:47,992 --> 00:31:49,962
Hello? A kid's in danger.

429
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:53,632
Break through the window or the main door.

430
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:54,732
Yes.

431
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:56,972
They'll take ten minutes at least.

432
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:59,172
I wonder if the ladder truck can get in.

433
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:01,542
Dae Sung, I need a few of you here.

434
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,741
Where are you going?

435
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:07,542
Stay right as you are.

436
00:32:09,382 --> 00:32:10,652
(Police)

437
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:15,481
(Police)

438
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:18,122
Don't move.

439
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:20,822
Where is she? What's going on?

440
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,621
Oh, my gosh!

441
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:24,462
It's Yul!

442
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:26,662
- Oh, dear. - Yul!

443
00:32:26,732 --> 00:32:28,502
Will someone do something?

444
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,401
- Is that Yul? - Yul!

445
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:33,372
Find something to catch her if she falls.

446
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:35,142
- Go. - Something to catch her with?

447
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:38,111
Let's check the recycling bins!

448
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,882
Don't move. Stay right as you are.

449
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:44,551
That's it. Stay very still. Don't move.

450
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:17,611
A digital door lock.

451
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:19,921
Yes.

452
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:22,682
He bought one.

453
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:30,262
(Closed temporarily)

454
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:34,661
(Closed temporarily)

455
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:52,082
Look around.

456
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:54,021
Part Timer, take this.

457
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,822
Let's go.

458
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:07,631
Is anyone home?

459
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,301
- Who is it? - I'm a police officer.

460
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:10,972
What's the matter?

461
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,471
Excuse me.

462
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:14,242
What...

463
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,641
Spread it all out.

464
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,442
- Help us. - Okay.

465
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:24,452
Here. Take this too.

466
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:26,352
Take this for me.

467
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:30,192
Yul.

468
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:34,292
Yul, hang in there. Stay still.

469
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:35,292
Is that A Hee?

470
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:37,191
- My gosh. - A Hee!

471
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:39,561
- What's she doing? - Hang on tight.

472
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,401
- What will she do? - Yul, keep still.

473
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:42,431
Oh, dear...

474
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,542
What are you doing there? I'm in.

475
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:57,081
That's the digital lock from Geumsung Realty.

476
00:34:57,511 --> 00:34:59,411
Geumsung Realty had the new one he'd bought.

477
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:01,282
Check this unit first.

478
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:02,681
I'll open that door too.

479
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:04,592
Be careful.

480
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:49,161
(Police)

481
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:53,072
Officer Do, are you crazy?

482
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:54,642
- A Hee! - She's out of her mind.

483
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:56,572
Watch your step.

484
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:02,411
Be careful.

485
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:03,582
- Be careful. - Careful.

486
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:06,552
A Hee!

487
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:07,882
Oh, dear...

488
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,192
She's out of her mind. She's crazy.

489
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,322
She's coming down.

490
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:15,062
Take your time.

491
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,192
- That's it. - Be careful.

492
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:21,101
Watch out.

493
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:24,332
Yul. Hang in there.

494
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:26,842
Stay right where you are.

495
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:45,822
Thank you.

496
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,462
It must be nice.

497
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:59,031
- Do something. - Watch your step.

498
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:10,251
A Hee...

499
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:14,081
Don't move, Yul.

500
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:15,481
Yul.

501
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,122
Take my hand.

502
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:27,661
It's okay. I will...

503
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,902
hold tight and never let go of you.

504
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:33,872
Grab hold of me.

505
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:40,412
Take her hand.

506
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:42,241
Be careful.

507
00:37:42,242 --> 00:37:43,352
Be careful.

508
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:45,282
- A Hee, watch out! - That's it.

509
00:37:45,281 --> 00:37:46,581
- Be careful. - There you go.

510
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,622
That's it. Hold on tight.

511
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:50,022
- Yul. - You're all right.

512
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:51,352
- Be careful. - Yul.

513
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,452
You're all right.

514
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:55,121
- Yul. - You're okay.

515
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:24,421
- Be careful. - Be careful.

516
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:26,221
- Be careful. - Be careful.

517
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,522
- Hold on tight. - Be careful.

518
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:34,231
They are safe.

519
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:38,572
- Gosh. Thank goodness. - Gosh.

520
00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:42,702
Gosh, Do Crazy.

521
00:38:48,511 --> 00:38:50,281
Yul. Are you all right?

522
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:54,151
You must have been scared.

523
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:00,762
Yul.

524
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:03,292
Where is...

525
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,861
your dad?

526
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,392
Yul is fine.

527
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:36,161
Seal off the entrance, please.

528
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,692
Seo Cheon Kyu...

529
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,142
It's okay.

530
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:58,981
I'm just going to check something. I'll be back right away.

531
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:01,881
Stay here and wait for me. Okay?

532
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:20,442
Dae Sung.

533
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:23,242
A Hee.

534
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:25,841
Who are you?

535
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:27,412
I recognize you.

536
00:40:27,912 --> 00:40:29,682
You're neither a man nor a woman.

537
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,982
You monster. How dare you?

538
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:35,681
You're the monster, not me.

539
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:43,222
I'm a friend of Kyung A, the girl you killed. You scumbag.

540
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,341
What on earth...

541
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:03,682
I know her.

542
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,051
Nguyen Thi Zhonglin.

543
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:12,221
That's Yul's mother.

544
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:23,062
Did she see this?

545
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:31,142
I found two corpses in Unit 408...

546
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:33,212
- Yul. - of Jinsong Apartment.

547
00:41:33,812 --> 00:41:34,812
I need backup.

548
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:36,951
Let's go.

549
00:41:43,051 --> 00:41:44,291
Are you all right?

550
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:45,622
What's that?

551
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:48,921
Mom, take Yul.

552
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:50,361
Go to Unit 409!

553
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:52,292
Unit 409?

554
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:53,961
What?

555
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:57,801
Hey!

556
00:41:58,002 --> 00:42:00,202
Hey. Are you all right?

557
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:04,241
Don't move.

558
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:08,882
I have eyes on the suspect!

559
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:11,151
He's going from the 4th floor to the 1st floor!

560
00:42:23,122 --> 00:42:25,062
Hey, there he comes.

561
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:26,062
Freeze!

562
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:28,062
- Gosh. - Goodness!

563
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:31,101
Stop right there, Seo Cheon Kyu!

564
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,071
This is Nawoo Two. We have an emergency.

565
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:38,671
A murder suspect is on the run toward Nawoo Elementary School...

566
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:40,041
from Jinsong Apartment.

567
00:43:08,372 --> 00:43:09,372
Did we lose him?

568
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,770
I'll go with him. Don't worry.

569
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:37,839
Are you okay?

570
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:42,939
Excuse me.

571
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,240
I heard a kid was locked up inside.

572
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,410
Where is she?

573
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,110
Oh, well...

574
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,520
She's scared and in great shock.

575
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,220
I don't think you can talk to her now.

576
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,060
We'll talk to her and bring her to the police station.

577
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:02,560
Let me go with you. Drop me off at the supermarket.

578
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,000
I should go and look for Seo Cheon Kyu.

579
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,999
Ma'am, it will be hard to look for him while driving.

580
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:09,129
Let me go with you too.

581
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,139
Sure.

582
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,190
This will be enough to put him away.

583
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,960
We'll find him soon...

584
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:36,359
once the police start looking for him.

585
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:37,459
Okay.

586
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,130
Then I'll keep Yul with me.

587
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:44,269
(Geumsung Realty)

588
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:47,339
Where do you think he went?

589
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,009
He knows now that he can't hide in a vacant unit anymore.

590
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:52,179
He won't leave this neighborhood that easily.

591
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,450
- Why not? - He didn't leave...

592
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,120
even after killing his wife.

593
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,619
Something must be keeping him here.

594
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,400
- Go. - Okay.

595
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,300
(Cafe)

596
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:53,539
Hey.

597
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:56,239
Oh, my. Hold on.

598
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,880
Let's see.

599
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,450
Hello?

600
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,850
Meat. Where are you now?

601
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,450
Okay.

602
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,360
He just went into the alley next to Hansol Studio.

603
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,060
Go into the alley.

604
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,470
Ma'am! There he is!

605
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,410
- Right there. - Where?

606
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,510
Go left.

607
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,810
That way.

608
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,250
- Over there. Step on it! - To the right?

609
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,240
(Mother)

610
00:46:59,709 --> 00:47:02,309
Mom. It's dangerous. Stay home...

611
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,540
I'm fine.

612
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:07,679
I'm with Meat.

613
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,310
I'll be home soon.

614
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:10,380
Yul.

615
00:47:12,919 --> 00:47:15,649
Dae Sung. How's Yul?

616
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:18,359
Is she okay?

617
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:20,589
Where are you?

618
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,690
- Are you home? - Yul?

619
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,400
- Yul? She's with Dad... - Hey.

620
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:25,599
Are you in the supermarket?

621
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,570
If you're still there, check...

622
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:31,199
the order number 505. Don't deliver it. Never.

623
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,570
That will put you in trouble. Don't deliver it!

624
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,540
What are you talking about?

625
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:42,149
If you don't do as I say, you'll die.

626
00:47:42,149 --> 00:47:44,149
I could just set this place on fire.

627
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:47,219
Okay.

628
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,390
I get it.

629
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:01,369
Darn!

630
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:11,479
- That doesn't sound right. - Five zero five.

631
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,880
That's what Yul said instead of SOS.

632
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,220
It's Yul. Yul is what Geumsung wants.

633
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:23,159
That's why he never left this town.

634
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,059
I'll request the location track on Ms. Han's phone...

635
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,790
and a search around this area.

636
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,130
If she calls you again, don't try to do anything.

637
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:31,599
Act like you know nothing and buy time.

638
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:49,509
The line got cut off.

639
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,080
Yul's with me in the supermarket.

640
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,320
Dad went to the police station to talk to Doo Hyun.

641
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:56,919
I was talking to Yul.

642
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,330
- Are you with Yul? - Yes, it's just the two of us.

643
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,270
Are the police going to the supermarket?

644
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,870
No, I don't think she's in condition to talk to them today.

645
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:13,639
It's only the two of us here.

646
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,440
Just us two.

647
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:23,149
(Design, construction)

648
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,180
If you mess with my kid or yours,

649
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,720
I'm going to kill you.

650
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,930
Too bad.

651
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,000
They might end up dead tonight...

652
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:40,099
like other women.

653
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:44,739
Whether it's my wife or my daughter...

654
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:46,769
or anyone else,

655
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,180
I like the feeling of having control over them.

656
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,250
When I don't,

657
00:49:53,749 --> 00:49:55,479
it makes me very upset.

658
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,920
You wish.

659
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,020
Don't be ridiculous.

660
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,360
Meat!

661
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,240
Meat.

662
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:31,419
(MS Mart)

663
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:39,320
(MS Mart)

664
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:45,430
(MS Mart)

665
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,440
(MS Mart)

666
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,080
Over here!

667
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,420
(Police)

668
00:51:05,419 --> 00:51:06,419
Meat.

669
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
Ms. Han. Are you okay?

670
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,230
A Hee. Dae Sung's in danger. We have to go to the supermarket.

671
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:16,289
What?

672
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:19,030
(Police)

673
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,130
Where's my daughter?

674
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,799
Kwon Bo Yeon.

675
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,600
Lee Kyung A.

676
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,370
Your wife.

677
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,280
Yul's mom, Nguyen Thi Zhonglin.

678
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,250
The police have videos of you beating and murdering them.

679
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:12,979
Five Dollars' body was found in your hideout.

680
00:52:12,979 --> 00:52:14,719
Yes. I know.

681
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:17,389
You think I can't kill you...

682
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:18,989
when I killed them all?

683
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,830
You couldn't kill Ms. Chairwoman and Detective Choi.

684
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,490
And you think their current condition...

685
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:23,930
is better than being dead?

686
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:26,099
Whatever.

687
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:28,099
Where's Yul?

688
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:30,369
She's all I need.

689
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,900
You may kill me, but you can never take her.

690
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,169
She's my daughter!

691
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,010
- Yes. - Dae Sung!

692
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,150
- Dae Sung. - Dae Sung.

693
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,320
Unfortunately, she may be your daughter, but you don't own her.

694
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,650
Just because she's your daughter,

695
00:52:47,649 --> 00:52:49,019
doesn't mean you can order her around.

696
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,060
Think about it.

697
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,430
How can you ever have someone your way?

698
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,730
You can't even do that with yourself.

699
00:52:57,729 --> 00:52:59,899
- Dae Sung. No. - Dae Sung.

700
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:01,669
Dae Sung.

701
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:03,269
What do you think you're doing?

702
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:04,269
Dae Sung.

703
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:05,869
Things aren't going your way even now.

704
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,710
- Dae Sung. No. - Dae Sung.

705
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:08,969
- No. - Dae Sung.

706
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,240
So you're weird...

707
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,339
for thinking that's possible.

708
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,380
Dae Sung.

709
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,379
- Dae Sung. - Dae Sung.

710
00:53:20,189 --> 00:53:22,219
- Dae Sung. - Dae Sung.

711
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,860
- Dae Sung. - An Dae Sung.

712
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,360
Dae Sung. Open it.

713
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,160
Dae Sung. An Dae Sung.

714
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,870
Dae Sung.

715
00:53:34,569 --> 00:53:35,869
Dae Sung.

716
00:55:15,129 --> 00:55:16,499
Is it for kindergarten class?

717
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,569
- It's for adults. - What?

718
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:22,169
That toy washing machine is a great shaker.

719
00:55:22,169 --> 00:55:23,269
Okay.

720
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,150
Daesung Mart, right?

721
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:30,579
You messed up my delivery.

722
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,250
I never ordered this.

723
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,220
It's the second time this week.

724
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,520
What about your shoes? Are you hurt?

725
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,190
What happened?

726
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,500
Here.

727
00:56:20,129 --> 00:56:23,099
You idiot. So why would you...

728
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:26,539
risk your life for someone else's business?

729
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,190
(Samyu Peaches)

730
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,460
A Hee!

731
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,100
My gosh.

732
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,130
Go, quick!

733
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,140
- Dae Sung! - Dae Sung!

734
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,140
Dae Sung!

735
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,370
Are you okay?

736
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:37,740
- Dae Sung. - Get up.

737
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,880
Seo Cheon Kyu, you're under arrest for murder.

738
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,950
You can hire an attorney,

739
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,550
and you can explain yourself.

740
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:55,390
I didn't risk my life for someone else's business.

741
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:01,029
I didn't...

742
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,840
try to avenge the victims.

743
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,370
I just...

744
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:10,539
hope that a customer I saw yesterday...

745
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:15,179
gets to come back today and tomorrow.

746
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:18,719
Without...

747
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:23,919
any troubles or fear.

748
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:28,589
Hey.

749
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,059
Who do you think you are?

750
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:33,129
Who are you?

751
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,570
What are you?

752
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,700
Who do you think?

753
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:40,099
Even if it didn't involve him,

754
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:43,510
when he saw someone get hurt or die, he cared about his neighbors...

755
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:45,439
instead of turning a blind eye.

756
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,110
He listened even to a little girl.

757
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,420
That's right.

758
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:54,750
If not for Dae Sung, none of us would've cared.

759
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,560
We'd have let it go thinking it wasn't my business!

760
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,560
That's right.

761
00:59:00,859 --> 00:59:02,529
Dae Sung's nosiness...

762
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:05,129
caught a killer.

763
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,030
Come along.

764
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,650
- Mom. - Dae Sung.

765
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,780
Well done.

766
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,519
You did great.

767
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:27,519
Well done, son.

768
00:59:27,919 --> 00:59:29,089
Well done.

769
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,320
You did great.

770
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:32,819
Good for you.

771
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,760
I'm proud of you.

772
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,099
We'll take it from here.

773
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,670
Come with us. Get in the car.

774
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:51,580
Watch him carefully.

775
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:53,439
Good job.

776
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,420
Thank you.

777
01:00:10,459 --> 01:00:11,459
Yul.

778
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,160
Are you okay?

779
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:28,310
(MS Mart)

780
01:00:49,169 --> 01:00:50,199
Hi.

781
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:53,270
You didn't have to come and get me.

782
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,270
Why did you even bother?

783
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:56,939
Let's go.

784
01:01:02,649 --> 01:01:04,379
Spinach.

785
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:06,719
- And two zucchinis. - Two zucchinis.

786
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,089
- Here you go. Cook something nice. - Thank you.

787
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:13,319
I'm here on my own, sorry.

788
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,029
I can't leave the stall to deliver.

789
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,190
Are you sure?

790
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:17,199
Of course, I am.

791
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,930
What are you doing? How rude.

792
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:22,729
Hello? Mic test. One, two.

793
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,300
This is a notice from the women's society chairwoman.

794
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,210
Today in the ground-level parking lot,

795
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:33,440
we're selling fresh organic produce delivered...

796
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,109
directly from the field.

797
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:37,449
Just for two hours. It's a limited deal.

798
01:01:38,379 --> 01:01:40,419
They're offering a special deal,

799
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,420
So fill your shopping bags with some great items.

800
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:45,889
Oh, my gosh.

801
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:48,660
I got here first!

802
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,460
- This looks so fresh. - They're all fresh.

803
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,130
That one? Yes, sure.

804
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,080
Products sent me.

805
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:07,449
She sent you something to celebrate your recovery.

806
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,850
Tell her to just be a good chairwoman.

807
01:02:11,149 --> 01:02:12,849
Once I'm out of here...

808
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:13,850
Mom.

809
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,090
What are you doing here?

810
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,530
I told you Products sent you a gift.

811
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,270
Mom.

812
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,930
She called around and finally reached her in the US.

813
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,640
My baby...

814
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:36,009
My dear baby...

815
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,410
Are you okay?

816
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,950
You're coming with me.

817
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:49,589
I'll treat you well.

818
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:51,559
- Goodbye! - Thank you.

819
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,760
Bye.

820
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:54,490
You want this?

821
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,760
(Courageous Civilian Certificate)

822
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,730
- And that too. - Okay.

823
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,100
She had a store since she was younger.

824
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,600
That's her son.

825
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,470
- Hello. - Hi.

826
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,369
- Hello. - Congratulations.

827
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,610
You're so handsome.

828
01:03:10,609 --> 01:03:11,609
Not really.

829
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,450
He's such a good son.

830
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:27,429
What took you so long? Hurry up.

831
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:34,329
You got even prettier.

832
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,000
You should be a model.

833
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:39,569
Part Timer, we need help.

834
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:40,569
Okay, coming.

835
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:42,540
Do you have clam meat?

836
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:43,569
- Clam meat? - Yes.

837
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:44,579
I'll get you some.

838
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:47,879
Are you in a good mood?

839
01:03:47,879 --> 01:03:49,849
You're so pretty I almost didn't recognize you.

840
01:03:50,379 --> 01:03:51,379
How cute.

841
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,030
What's this?

842
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,600
(Chocolate Pie)

843
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,540
- Who would open... - I apologize.

844
01:04:15,169 --> 01:04:18,439
I was passing by and came in to get something.

845
01:04:19,339 --> 01:04:21,379
I thought I should apologize while I was here.

846
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,620
I was just doing my job but...

847
01:04:27,419 --> 01:04:28,489
I got you all wrong.

848
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,590
This is on us.

849
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:33,789
Thanks.

850
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,830
And don't ever come to...

851
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:43,030
our store with a frown, dear valued customer.

852
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:52,740
Always by our side Happy, happy MS

853
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,150
Hey, Yul. Hello!

854
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:56,809
- Are you back from school? - Yes.

855
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,680
- I ate and am off to extra class. - Is it Yul?

856
01:04:58,749 --> 01:04:59,819
Where's Grandma?

857
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:01,450
Grandma!

858
01:05:01,789 --> 01:05:03,419

- Hello. - Hello.

861
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:11,259
Dae Sung, when will you visit?

862
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,200
Next month. With A Hee.

863
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,170
Okay. You have to visit, okay?

864
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,740
Yul, if you want to come back here,

865
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:19,540
- just... - Yul!

866
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:21,309
Let's go!

867
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:22,909
I have to go now.

868
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,239
- Bye. - Okay.

869
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,480
- Take care. - Bye!

870
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,250
I'm jealous.

871
01:05:29,249 --> 01:05:30,919
She's much cuter now.

872
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:35,519
(Pineapple)

873
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,560
You. What do you do for a living?

874
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:45,129
Right now, I'm a cashier.

875
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,300
Then...

876
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,800
what do you dream to be?
