What?

3
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,919
She was a kindergarten teacher.

4
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,149
She lived alone...

5
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:51,958
and likely saw a shrink for depression.

6
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,929
That'll be 14 dollars 50 cents.

7
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,329

Do you want the receipt?

13
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,549
Sometimes her friends sleep over.

14
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:21,048
She's not seeing anyone.

15
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,489
Did you know the victim?

16
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,619
She was a regular at our store.

17
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,029
Jinsong Apartment Building 3 Unit 403, Kwon Bo Yeon.

18
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,929
Her cell number is 010-135-6674.

19
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,798
- Yes? - She had over 30,000 points...

20
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:40,168
and could use that as cash.

21
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,309
Do you know this well about all your regulars?

22
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:46,909
He's the son of the owner of the supermarket by the complex.

23
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,279
He grew up here.

24
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:49,549
Even so...

25
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,319
Dae Sung, you know the old man's caregiver's number, right?

26
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,089
Yes. He lives alone but someone from the church...

27
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,218
visits twice a week.

28
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:57,788
Her name is Cho Sook Ja.

29
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,729
Her number is 010-932-2845.

30
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:04,259
Okay.

31
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:05,828
A Hee.

32
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:08,529
He has diabetes.

33
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,998
He's the reason we sell girasol.

34
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,398
What about Alzheimer's?

35
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:16,208
He trains with nunchucks in the rain and snow too.

36
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:18,478
- I doubt he has that. - Why?

37
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:19,779
He comes by all the time...

38
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:22,308
and he pays the exact amount in cash, down to the last cent.

39
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:24,148
Even before we give him the total.

40
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,179
He's suspicious, right?

41
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,959
He's handsome, tall, and smart.

42
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:36,928
But he's a loser and useless too.

43
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,028
Something doesn't feel right, does it?

44
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:43,929

45
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,439
Thanks for cooperating.

46
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:49,968
We might call you, so don't go too far.

47
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,639
I don't have...

48
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,708

Myung Sook!

53
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,029
Good morning.

54
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:49,928
A dead body was found last night.

55
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:50,929
Have you heard?

56
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,598
What?

57
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,339
The path that leads into Jinsong, close to the playground.

58
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:58,008
There's a dark thicket to one side.

59
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:01,338
- Yes. - They found a dead woman there.

60
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:04,179
- That was our neighborhood? - You heard too?

61
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:06,379
Yes. Women were talking in hushed voices,

62
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:07,918
and I thought it was in the news.

63
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,519
My goodness. What happened?

64
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,458
Myung Sook, you didn't know?

65
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,789
How can you not know?

66
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,228
How could I know?

67
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,429
The person who found the body...

68
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:21,698
Hello.

69
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:25,769
It's him.

70
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,939
Right? It was you.

71
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,509
You found the body last night.

72
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,479
While making a delivery last night.

73
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,579
Gosh. So, who was it?

74
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:42,418
Is it someone we know?

75
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,449
Kwon Bo Yeon, the kindergarten teacher.

76
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:47,388
Gosh, I know her!

77
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,689
She was the youngest teacher there.

78
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:50,958
Oh, no.

79
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,398
- I think I know who it is. - Right?

80
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:54,758
So, did you call the police?

81
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,329
Yes. I told the police everything I know.

82
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:02,208
- Did you? Good. - Goodness...

83
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,568
- They'll take it from here. - The young teacher.

84
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:06,238
Can you stop causing a fuss...

85
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,509
- and get changed for work? - Okay.

86
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,348
- Go on. - Okay, okay.

87
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:14,318
The women were all talking about it.

88
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:15,988
It's so scary.

89
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,218
Don't worry about me, Mom.

90
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:24,329
Here. These are for those.

91
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,058
We can't give out the plastic bags with our old name.

92
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:32,198
Put these stickers on them all whenever you're free, by today.

93
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,069
Is it true that...

94
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,139
Dae Sung was the first to find her?

95
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,779
Yes. How many times must I tell you?

96
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,649
A dead body in the apartment complex?

97
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:44,848
Look at the goosebumps.

98
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,379
- Where are they? - Don't be silly.

99
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,089
It got so scary now,

100
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,589
I can't relax even at home.

101
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,289
Neither can I.

102
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,289
I know, right?

103
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,919
Housing prices will fall around here.

104
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:58,929
Gut it.

105
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,159
Watch your fingers.

106
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,568
Then sprinkle salt on it.

107
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,809
No, not that much. It'll be too salty.

108
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,208
Scrape some off.

109
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,578
Just a little. That's it.

110
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,749
Not bad.

111
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,849
Just a little practice and you'll do fine.

112
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,318
Keep practicing.

113
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:24,318

114
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,518
Will you do it properly?

115
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:30,029
I'll dock your pay for every bag you mess up.

116
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,089
Ten cents each.

117
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,058
This intern's barely paid anything.

118
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,399
Did you think it would be easy to work for others?

119
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:37,598
"Others", Mom?

120
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:39,039
That doesn't apply to us.

121
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,099
Isn't it a pity?

122
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,109
It would've been great if we were strangers.

123
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,279
What's this?

124
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,649
Do your job properly.

125
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,879

I fell from my scooter and hurt myself.

131

No.

133
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:23,948
She'll be back.

134
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:27,248
You don't really know whose it is, do you?

135
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,148
I do know.

136
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,989
Where did you find it?

137
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,259
In the church garden.

138
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:34,718

140
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:42,728
Did you see anything other than that?

141
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:45,128
Well...

142
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:50,908
- The police lady. - What?

143
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,509
I saw her on the way here.

144

Yes. It's tough.

00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:00,258
Anyway, he became super cool.

187
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:02,768
He was incredibly smart,

188
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:05,969
but he kept failing the civil service exam.

189
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:11,069
I was going to tell him I really didn't care about that...

200

Garbage.

Yes?

Were you hurt?

213
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,588
- It wasn't her. I... - That's fine then.

215

216
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,929

- That's not... - Okay.

222
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,229
I'll clean it up.

- Come on. Go help him. - Gosh.

254

- Hey. - That's why I've been buying...

255
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:47,045
a pair of nude pantyhose...

256
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:48,615
every week for the last 20 years.

257
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:49,946
Do you know how many pairs I bought from here?

258
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:50,946

260
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,886
I guess I did buy a lot of pantyhose.

261
00:18:57,285 --> 00:19:00,125
That's my point! I bought over 1,000 pairs of pantyhose here.

262
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:01,656
How could you not have the pair I like in stock?

263
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:05,325
Don't you know how much I spent at your supermarket?

264
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,565
Considering the changes in the prices for the pantyhose,

265
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:10,005
you probably spent about 1,690 dollars.

What's the point of being a loyal customer?

273
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:30,856

277

278
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:51,176

291
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,236
You can't give me this.

292
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:23,545
They might get the wrong idea.

293
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:26,015
They might think I'm going on a power trip here.

Everyone knows you're the VIP customer here.

296
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,246

00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:35,956

301
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,765

I'm not just throwing a fit here.

303
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:46,465

00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:49,136
Gosh. Of course, I know that.

305
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:50,706
Here. I'll see you at the marketplace.

306
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:54,706
There.

307
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:58,875

Hello. This is Officer Do A Hee of Nawoo Police Substation.

320
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:00,895
I have something to report about Kwon Bo Yeon's murder case.

321
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:02,735
Who is this?

322
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,736
I'm just someone who wants to help.

323
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:08,506
Are you crazy?

324
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:12,145
Even if you want to help, a prank call like this...

325
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:13,146
It's not a prank call.

326
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:16,116
I really want to tell you what I know, Officer Do.

327
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:18,585
I see. So you want me to personally end you.

328
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:20,285
Kwon Bo Yeon was strangled, right?

329
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:21,785
Ligature strangulation.

330
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:26,226
I bet a piece of soft and elastic cloth was used.

331
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,666
(Enjoy a balloon party at home now! These helium balloons...)

332
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:31,725

Who is this, you jerk?

334
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:40,336
You'll get your answer once we meet.

336
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:03,966
A Hee!

337
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:12,936
Didn't I tell you...

338
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:15,846
if you pull a prank on me, you might end up dead?

339
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:24,815
- What am I holding? - The murder weapon.

340
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:26,915
I don't think the victim wore them.

341
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,286
She always bought the coffee-colored ones.

342
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:30,086
- But that one is nude. - Hey!

343
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:36,266
Did you contaminate the crime scene before the police got there?

344
00:24:36,265 --> 00:24:37,565
No. Of course, not.

345
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:38,765
Then...

346
00:24:39,265 --> 00:24:41,365
No way. You're not, right?

347
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:43,665
I'm a police officer.

348
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:46,875
I don't love you enough to harbor a criminal.

349
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,206
You might not love me that much,

350
00:24:48,636 --> 00:24:49,746
but you do love me?

351
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:52,545
Come on. I love you enough to serve yukgaejang at your funeral...

352
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:55,375
because if you keep it up, I'll kill you.

353
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:57,416
I'm not joking.

354
00:24:57,785 --> 00:24:59,355
I picked them up in front of the church.

355
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:01,356
But I also found these.

356
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:05,455
They are the same pills at the crime scene, right?

357
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:08,555
Why did you go to the church all of a sudden?

358
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:10,265
There's a kid who comes to the supermarket often...

359
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:13,265
That's not important right now. We need to catch the culprit fast.

360
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,166
Why?

361
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:17,466
- Why? - Who do you think you are?

362
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:20,675
Why does it matter to you whether we catch the culprit or not?

363
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,145
Of course, it matters.

364
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,046
- My girlfriend is a cop. - Seriously.

365
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:27,546
It would be great if I can help you catch the culprit.

366
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:29,685
Then you can even get a promotion.

367
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:31,545
So I'm helping you.

368
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:35,585
With this, your father might give us his blessing on our relationship.

369
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:38,885
What will happen if he does? What's next?

370
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,355
What's next?

371
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:42,596
- It will be great. - Seriously?

372
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:44,565
We'll be happy.

373
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,596
What about marriage?

374
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,935
A Hee. I'm not ready yet.

375
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:55,206
Dae Sung. I want to get married.

376
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:57,406
I've been in a long-term relationship.

377
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:58,746
I want to have kids early.

378
00:25:58,745 --> 00:26:00,415
Women these days don't want to have kids.

379
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:01,746
I don't care about other women!

380
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:03,445
I'll have kids because I want them.

381
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:04,986
Right. You should do what you want...

382
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:05,985
No.

383
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:08,356
So tell me.

384
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,585
You really want to be a supportive husband?

385
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:12,556
For the rest of your life?

386
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:21,096
The supermarket owner's son. The police officer's boyfriend.

387
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:23,405
How much longer will you be labeled like that?

388
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,905
Can't you be your own man?

389
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:39,685
(High-elasticity Pantyhose, coffee)

390
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,456
Seriously. That crazy hag.

391
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,625
What's so great about the nude pantyhose? Gosh.

392
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,095
I stocked up with high-elasticity pantyhose. The ones in nude.

393
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:54,895
Let that meanie know if she comes back.

394
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:56,035
Okay.

395
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:59,006
Goodbye. Come again.

396
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:04,575
You left the counter without talking to me first.

397
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:06,445
You have a month. If you can't...

398
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:07,446
I'll get the sales up.

399
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:09,345
I can do it. Let's go.

400
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:11,245
Forget it.

401
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:15,116
It's time. Go play the music.

402
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,126
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:17,626
(MS Mart)

404
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:25,526
(Goodbye)

405
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:30,905
Yes!

406
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,706
I should hurry. I have a lot of stuff to buy today.

407
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:38,146
- Hey. - Yes?

408
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:39,146
Here.

409
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:41,016
- What's this? - A customer ordered it,

410
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:42,315
but never came to get it.

411
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:44,815
I ordered a really tasty cut.

412
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:45,815
Really?

413
00:27:46,386 --> 00:27:47,416
(Korean sirloin: 42.34 dollars)

414
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,126
Hey. This is too expensive.

415
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,456
It's expensive even with the 50-percent discount.

416
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:54,156
I'm good. I'm not that big on meat anyway.

417
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:58,496
How could you not like meat?

418
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,195
- No. - Right.

419
00:28:02,196 --> 00:28:03,606
She's been feeling enervated lately.

420
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:05,206
Let her have it. Okay?

421
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,606
Wait. No. Hey. Hold on.

422
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:10,206
Hold on.

423
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:14,646
You're not going to shop?

424
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:16,186
This is when we get to buy groceries with discounts.

425
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:18,546
We get to do this once every week with 50-percent discounts.

426
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:19,785
Did you say, "50"?

427
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:20,785
Yes.

428
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:27,156
(Hot Glue Sticks)

429
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:31,926
(Hamburg Steak)

430
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:35,995
How are you settling in here?

431
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:37,465
(MS Mart)

432
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,636
So-so.

433
00:28:38,636 --> 00:28:39,736
You look tired.

434
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:41,636
You don't use the mic either.

435
00:28:42,676 --> 00:28:43,776
I'm not tired.

436
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:45,946
I'm just a timid newbie.

437
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:48,315
I think you should try to lure customers.

438
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:51,186
We sell so few fish nowadays.

439
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:53,755
Why do you care?

440
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:58,056
Oh, because you're the owner's son?

441
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,656
(High-elasticity Pantyhose, nude)

442
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:07,335
Why are you buying pantyhose?

443
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:10,565
Because I need it.

444
00:29:13,106 --> 00:29:14,206
Is it for your mother?

445
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:17,576
Your girlfriend?

446
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:23,145
After the 50-percent discount, it's 24 dollars 15 cents.

447
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:26,456
You're paying by card.

448
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:31,455

449
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:37,995

450
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,336
Meonji.

451
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,035
Meonji.

452
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,575
I'm sorry.

453
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:50,806
Thank you.

454
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,276
Thank you so much.

455
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:53,745
Get home safe and sound.

456
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:55,816
Thank you.

457
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:03,456
Bye. Don't run away from home again.

458
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:08,896
(Police Substation)

459
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:12,066
Actually...

460
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:14,695
My Meonji...

461
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:18,436
didn't run away from home.

462
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:20,176
What happened, then?

463
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,035
My ex-boyfriend...

464
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:29,046
- Let's go inside. - Come inside.

465
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:30,686
About a week ago,

466
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:33,385
I broke up with him.

467
00:30:35,255 --> 00:30:37,355
And he threatened me.

468
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:41,056
He said he wouldn't let me live happily.

469
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:46,895
I didn't think there was much he could do.

470
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:50,705
Did he visit you or follow you after the breakup?

471
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:52,636
He visited every day.

472
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:55,835
He'd send me dozens of texts and emails.

473
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:58,345
Was Meonji at home when he went missing?

474
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:02,215
Yes. My ex had taken the card key from my drawer.

475
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:04,916
Why didn't you report it stolen?

476
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:08,556
I tried, but was told to try and...

477
00:31:08,555 --> 00:31:09,825
patch things up.

478
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,325
Who said that?

479
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:13,256
What stupid officer said that?

480
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:17,265
I will find him and put him away for you.

481
00:31:18,196 --> 00:31:20,066
Have you heard of the anti-stalking law?

482
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:22,136
He'll get out really soon, though.

483
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:24,506
No. He continuously stalked you,

484
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:26,605
broke into your place, and waited for you there.

485
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:28,075
He used a phone,

486
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:32,105
and though it's not an object, he used your dog to scare you.

487
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:33,376
He meets all the criteria.

488
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,316
He can get up to three years in prison.

489
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:38,616
That depends on what happens in court.

490
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:41,015
But still, he can be punished.

491
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:43,185
So don't worry.

492
00:31:43,356 --> 00:31:45,956
You should file a report today.

493
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,226
If you have the texts...

494
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:51,396
and photo or video evidence, give them all to me.

Did you have dinner?

500
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:09,016
Shall I buy you your favorite? Steamed crab?

501
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:14,815
Shall we get pregnant first?

502
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:17,825
I'm not that confident but I can try...

503
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:21,125
This is insane.

504
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:23,765
Where's the bean flour?

505
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,066
The bean flour is...

507
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:30,705
I'll show you. Come with me.

(MS Mart)

509
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:41,616
Who's in charge of deliveries here?

510
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:45,246
Why are there so many problem customers these days?

511
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:50,426
We don't have delivery staff right now.

512
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,526
What's the matter?

513
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:55,126
Why do you keep dropping off items I never ordered?

514
00:32:56,255 --> 00:32:57,365
What?

515
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:03,266
We don't deliver anything under 30 dollars.

516
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:07,505
The items in here probably cost ten dollars at most.

517
00:33:08,676 --> 00:33:10,176
Then who is it?

518
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,545
Why are you doing this to me?

519
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:16,815
- Hey. - Miss.

520
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:19,116
You can't cause a fuss here.

521
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:21,516
It's not like we charged you for what you didn't buy.

522
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:25,226
The items in here aren't dangerous or disgusting either.

523
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:27,956
Is someone with a crush on you leaving you presents?

524
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:29,425
No?

525
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:31,795
- Look. - Why?

526
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:32,826
They're tampons.

527
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:35,836
What's this?

528
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:39,266
Do you think it's a stalker?

529
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,646
Miss.

530
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:46,415
Go over there, both of you.

531
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:48,675
Hello, Yul. Hello.

532
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,685
Thank you for lending this to her.

533
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:51,816
Oh, sure.

534
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:53,785
Goodness.

535
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,615
Yul, you must be pleased today.

536
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,625
Dad got off work early.

537
00:33:57,756 --> 00:34:00,196
You're even wearing new clothes.

538
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:02,026
You look lovely.

539
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:04,296
She comes here a lot, doesn't she?

540
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,635
I heard she tried to buy soju.

541
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:09,866
I didn't ask her to, but she wanted to get it for me.

542
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,835
Sorry for the trouble.

543
00:34:11,836 --> 00:34:14,406
It's no trouble at all. We're neighbors.

544
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:16,705
Let's see. Oh.

545
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:20,375
- Are you going to the hospital? - Yes.

546
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:22,175
I heard your wife was admitted.

547
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:23,516
Is she very sick?

548
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,815
Well, yes, she is.

549
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:30,725
Still, for your daughter's sake, don't drink too much.

550
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:31,786
Okay.

551
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:34,126
- Do you need a bag? - Yes.

552
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:37,425
That'll be 39 dollars 29 cents.

553
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,896
Here you go.

554
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,935
Wait a moment, Yul.

555
00:34:46,236 --> 00:34:49,106
Let me give you something.

556
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,775
This is for you.

557
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:55,546
You gave one to me last time and the last time before that.

558
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:56,916
Seo Yul.

559
00:34:57,316 --> 00:34:59,686
It's fine. I want to give her something.

560
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:02,085
Wait here, Yul.

561
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,485
Tada.

562
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:07,256
Your mom always bought you this.

563
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:10,725
She'll get well soon and come home to you.

564
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:13,266
Don't worry and look after yourself.

565
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:15,196
And listen to your dad.

566
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:18,006
- Thank you. - Sure.

567
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:20,006
- See you. - Bye.

568
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,335
Bye, Yul.

569
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:24,346
Bye.

570
00:35:25,945 --> 00:35:29,245
So, did you call the police?

571
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,085
They said they'll look for the person,

572
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:35,185
but my complex is old and there are no cameras.

573
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,685
I'm scared to death.

574
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:40,696
Can you stay somewhere else? With a friend, maybe?

575
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:43,826
She must be too scared to go back home.

576
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,896
I came back home yesterday from a friend's place.

577
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,496
I can't keep bothering her.

578
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:52,705
(Daesung)

579
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,176
(Chocolate Pie)

580
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,475
(High-elasticity Pantyhose, nude)

581
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:01,516
When did you get that bag with the pantyhose?

582
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:07,315
I found it yesterday when I got back from my friend's.

583
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:10,186
Tell me the dates and order you found these.

584
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:12,926
Why? Do you know something, Dae Sung?

585
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,295
Did anything go missing from home?

586
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,725
- Like shoes or... - No.

587
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:18,426
Miss. It has nothing to do with us so...

588
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:19,695
You have my membership details.

589
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:21,996
Delete it for me.

590
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:24,235
Okay, sure.

591
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:26,876
(MS Mart)

592
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:28,506
It's Lee Kyung A, right?

593
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:30,576
(Lee Kyung A)

594
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,746
Don't you need the last digits of my phone number?

595
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:36,146
How do you know me?

596
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:38,546
He's a smart kid.

597
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:40,816
He remembers everyone he saw just a few times.

598
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:42,216
Does he deliver items too?

599
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:45,285
He does sometimes.

600
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,556
Miss. Don't come here to complain,

601
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:51,995
Sort it out with the police.

602
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:53,635
It could be one of our customers.

603
00:36:55,736 --> 00:36:58,066
She's a customer, that's our plastic bag,

604
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:00,106
and we stock everything in those bags.

605
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:02,706
The chocolate pies, pantyhose, tampons.

606
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:04,676
The people who bought those...

607
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:08,176
Why should we look for someone even the police won't?

608
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:11,746
What if we suspect our customers, word gets out, and we go down?

609
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:15,756
Miss, take those and throw them away...

610
00:37:15,756 --> 00:37:17,026
or do whatever you want.

611
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,386
Please, just leave.

612
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:20,295
Family. Our new marketing concept.

613
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:22,326
Stop talking about family.

614
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:25,325
Please leave.

615
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:28,195
Leave. Go home.

616
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:31,436
Keep it.

617
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,406
We'll keep it since it's evidence.

618
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,375
If you need it...

619
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:40,546
- Give me that. - Mom.

620
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,315
Can she just throw that away?

621
00:37:45,316 --> 00:37:48,256
What if the girl posts about it? That could be a disaster.

622
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:51,556
Our sales are already falling. That will fuel the fire.

623
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:53,526
We'll go down in no time.

624
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:55,926
Hey, you.

625
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:58,466
If you're that worried we'll go down,

626
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:01,765
stay at your station and do your job.

627
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:05,265
Myung Sook, I don't like what you're saying.

628
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:09,476
Are you saying I'm the reason sales are dropping?

629
00:38:09,905 --> 00:38:13,245
Gosh... You shouldn't say that.

630
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:16,476
Last month, you paid me two days late,

631
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,646
and I didn't say a word.

632
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:21,216
I never had to pay a late fee but I did because of you.

633
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,685
The 42 cents late fee for your water bill?

634
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:28,026
Fine. Here you go. I'll pay you for it.

635
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:29,555
With interest.

636
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:30,695
Why are you like this?

637
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:32,695
Everyone knows you have lots of cash...

638
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:35,395
and a son who works at a huge company.

639
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,396
What?

640
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:38,666
You paid a late fee because of 42 cents?

641
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,036
What does me being rich...

642
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:42,805
have to do with you not paying me?

643
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:45,876
If I were going to pay for my expenses without being paid,

644
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,946
why would I work here?

645
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:50,215
Hey! I know that rich people are worse, but...

646
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:53,516
I kept apologizing to you again and again,

647
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:56,056
but you kept grumbling about late fees, other stores,

648
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:57,355
and things like that.

649
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:59,986
- But what? You didn't say anything? - Stop it.

650
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:03,226
She's just worried about the store.

651
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:06,166
You. If you're so worried about our store,

652
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,366
how could you go interview when Sam Mart opened?

653
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,805
She may have just looked...

654
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,335
because she was nervous...

655
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:15,475
You don't understand because you're not in our shoes.

656
00:39:15,476 --> 00:39:17,776
To be blunt, even if the store goes bankrupt,

657
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:19,506
you'll be rolling in money once the area is redeveloped.

658
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:20,916
What are you worried about?

659
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,886
You little... You don't know anything.

660
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,716
Forget it. Why do I bother?

661
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:28,955
Why not? Why?

662
00:39:28,956 --> 00:39:30,726
Say everything while we're at it!

663
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:31,726
Hey, you.

664
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:33,955
Forget it!

665
00:39:34,396 --> 00:39:35,396
Why you...

666
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:36,766
Oh my gosh.

667
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:38,396
- That hurts! - Stop that.

668
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:41,536
Hey, you! Do you want a piece of me?

669
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:44,205
- Fine! Let's fight! - Come on! Stop it!

670
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:45,536
Come at me!

671
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:47,236
Let go!

672
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:49,805
Darn it. Stop it!

673
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,745
- I can take you. - Stop it!

674
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:54,845
- Why you... - Let go of me!

675
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:57,015
- Why are you two doing this? - Come on!

676
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:58,885
Mom! Stop it!

677
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:00,985
- Mom! - You witch!

678
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:03,856
How could you do that?

679
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:05,356
I'll teach you a lesson.

680
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,295
You little...

681
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:11,196
- Stop it! - Let's end this today!

682
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:12,695
Who's the jerk?

683
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:19,035
What jerk...

684
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:22,305
is pulling that garbage with goods from our store?

685
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:23,805
Shoot.

686
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:33,085
Hey.

687
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:34,986
- Let go. - You first.

688
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:36,286
Let go!

Fix this door. It's about to fall off.

692
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:12,156
It'll be nice and cool then.

693

(Cup noodles)

694
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:17,095
That's for us to eat.

695
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:18,365
Okay.

696
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:25,205
Can we really find the perp using these?

697
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:27,676
I'm sure not that many people bought all of these from us.

698

a bloody tampon...

724
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:24,595
Hey. If we bring it to the cops,

725
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:26,465
can't they test that for DNA...

726
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:27,765
and identify the perp?

727
00:42:28,195 --> 00:42:29,335
I'm sure it's not their blood.

728
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:30,505
True.

729
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:35,735
Then should we narrow it down to just men?

730
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:39,406
Remember that man who always bought maxi pads for his wife?

731
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:40,815
He was caught...

732
00:42:40,816 --> 00:42:42,576
flashing girls in front of the girls' high school.

733
00:42:43,015 --> 00:42:44,885
From what I can see,

734
00:42:45,715 --> 00:42:48,515
he's a perverted stalker.

735
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:51,826
In other words, it can't be a woman.

736
00:42:52,785 --> 00:42:55,755
No. We should be thorough just in case.

737
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:57,525
How will you check them then?

738
00:42:57,726 --> 00:43:00,766
First, we'll ask Lee Kyung A if she knows any of them.

739
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:03,365
- If not? - If a bag shows up again,

740
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:05,735
we'll see if any of these people bought those items.

741
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:07,776
We changed bags not that long ago,

742
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:10,106
so if they use the new bag next time,

743
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:11,706
we can narrow it down...

744
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:14,376
to people who bought those items after we changed bags.

745
00:43:14,515 --> 00:43:16,045
You really are...

746
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:17,616
Don't call me a genius.

747
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:19,645
That was ancient history.

748
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:21,855
Remember what our homeroom teacher said...

749
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:23,616
when we were in the eighth grade?

750
00:43:25,226 --> 00:43:28,256
Curiosity killed the cat.

751
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:30,625
Dae Sung's nosy nature may kill him.

752
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:32,296
Never forget.

753
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:34,066
You need to worry about yourself.

754
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:36,296
Don't you remember?

755
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,906
Seeing you now reminds me of back then.

756
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:41,836
You...

757
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:44,275
You were a big busybody throughout middle school...

758
00:43:44,276 --> 00:43:46,846
and always got yourself into trouble.

759
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:49,145
But suddenly one day, you changed completely...

760
00:43:49,146 --> 00:43:50,546
and became really weird.

761
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,085
Like you had a screw loose.

762
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:55,416
You seemed too strange back then,

763
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,886
so I couldn't get myself to ask.

764
00:43:57,425 --> 00:43:58,885
What happened to you?

765
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:01,896
I probably didn't want to study.

766
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,496
Throw out your trash.

767
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:05,865
Don't leave it here.

768
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:07,435
You throw it out.

769
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:10,465
Later.

Hello?

773
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:49,136
Hi, Dae Sung.

774
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:52,245
Yes, I'm still at the store.

775
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:54,345
Why? Should I pick you up?

776
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:59,015
Okay. I'll wait here then. Be careful.

777
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:00,186
Okay.

778
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:04,125
I'm so tired.

779
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:08,996
Let's see.

780
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:26,275
Dae Sung, is that you?

781
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,916
That's 12 dollars...

816
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:09,047
You bought the canned peaches and a can opener yesterday.

817
00:48:09,046 --> 00:48:11,546
Oh, that? I was volunteering at the church yesterday.

818
00:48:11,546 --> 00:48:13,246
I went to the hospital.

819
00:48:13,247 --> 00:48:16,617
Nunchucks Grandpa was shocked, so he's in the hospital now.

820
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:19,756
And he goes crazy over these canned peaches.

821
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:22,126
He was eating them with gusto.

822
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:24,896
Watching him worked up my appetite. So I really need to have some.

823
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:28,566
How is he doing? He must have been so shocked that night.

824
00:48:28,796 --> 00:48:29,996
I bet he's just faking it.

825
00:48:29,997 --> 00:48:31,267
He seemed perfectly fine.

It's my treat. Try this.

837
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:05,897
I'm sure you know he brings good-quality items.

838
00:49:06,097 --> 00:49:09,467
By the way, when will they decide on the redevelopment plan?

839
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:11,077
- I haven't heard anything about it. - What?

840
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:14,107
Do you support the redevelopment plan?

841
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,916
Yes. That way, our property value will go up.

842
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:18,016
Won't that be better for us?

843
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:21,287
It will take at least ten years for the plan to go through.

844
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:23,586
We will be without a home for all those years.

845
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:26,586
Then anyone can move into our neighborhood and ruin it.

846

- Why would you want that? - Gosh.

847
00:49:28,787 --> 00:49:29,927
Is that so?

848
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:32,496
But the apartments are so old.

849
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:34,067
Think about your age...

850
00:49:34,296 --> 00:49:36,496
and the years we lived here.

851
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:39,636
Do you think you can get used to a new house at our age?

852
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:42,206
And imagine getting sick on top of that.

853
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:44,537
If treatments don't go well, you won't even be able to come back.

854
00:49:44,537 --> 00:49:46,947
You'll be sent to a nursing home right away.

855
00:49:47,146 --> 00:49:49,076
You do have a point.

856

- Wave your hands - Don't you agree?

857
00:49:52,476 --> 00:49:54,046
You're right.

858
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:56,887
The increased property value will be good news for our children.

859
00:49:57,157 --> 00:49:59,587
It's easier for us to stay in this neighborhood.

860
00:50:01,256 --> 00:50:02,626

They have their own pool of delivery people.

883
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:16,397
I signed up to deliver for them.

884
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:17,896
Is that so hard to understand?

00:51:21,566 --> 00:51:23,066
I can earn the delivery fee...

888
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:24,676

889
00:51:24,677 --> 00:51:27,907

907
00:53:38,307 --> 00:53:39,407
Okay.

908
00:53:39,776 --> 00:53:42,506
The culprit who killed the teacher hasn't been caught, right?

909

No.

00:53:47,077 --> 00:53:48,247

913
00:53:51,456 --> 00:53:53,926
- She can't go around alone now. - Right.

914

920

I even checked his ID.

1093
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:33,156
What's housebreaking?

1094
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:39,297
It feels so weird.

1095
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:42,167
It does. Why did he lie about his age?

1096
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:43,467
How did you get this?

1097
01:04:44,907 --> 01:04:47,707
Oh, while dealing with a drunk.

1098
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:49,507
That's so upsetting.

1099
01:04:51,146 --> 01:04:52,246
Wait here for a bit.

1100
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:55,447
I'll get some band-aids.

1101
01:05:08,626 --> 01:05:09,626
Excuse me.

1102
01:05:10,497 --> 01:05:11,497
You dropped...

1103
01:05:13,836 --> 01:05:14,936
Nunchucks Grandpa.

1104
01:05:29,017 --> 01:05:30,217
Get him, A Hee!

1105
01:05:32,717 --> 01:05:33,717
Oh, no.

1106
01:05:47,497 --> 01:05:48,637
Who are you?

1107
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:35,216
Up until yesterday...

1108
01:06:37,186 --> 01:06:38,956
she was alive.

1109
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:45,657
(Samyu Peaches)

1110
01:06:52,697 --> 01:06:53,697
A Hee!

1111
01:06:58,707 --> 01:07:00,777
(The Killer's Shopping List)

1112
01:07:21,426 --> 01:07:22,526
There must be an accomplice.

1113
01:07:22,797 --> 01:07:24,497
Do you suspect someone?

1114
01:07:25,066 --> 01:07:27,296
Fish. What is he really?

1115
01:07:28,106 --> 01:07:30,306
We need something more concrete.

1116
01:07:30,306 --> 01:07:32,706
The culprit could be in the store.

1117
01:07:34,106 --> 01:07:35,106
Dae Sung!

1118
01:07:35,106 --> 01:07:37,306
The murder weapons were items you can buy from our store.

1119
01:07:37,646 --> 01:07:40,216
Did you know that the new suspect...

1120
01:07:40,316 --> 01:07:41,946
was Dae Sung?

1121
01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:44,246
What did we do wrong?

1122
01:07:46,556 --> 01:07:49,956
We need to prove that the store has nothing to do with the case.

1123
01:07:51,356 --> 01:07:52,496
Were you caught?

1124
01:07:53,526 --> 01:07:54,896
I think I found the evidence.
