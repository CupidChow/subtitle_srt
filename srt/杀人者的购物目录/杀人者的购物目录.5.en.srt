1
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:38,747
(The drama was shot in the presence of the child actress' guardian.)

2
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:10,807
Yul.

3
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:13,377
(Episode 5)

4
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:14,616
Seo Yul.

5
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,856
I think Yul witnessed the murder.

6
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:20,987
If the killer finds her...

7
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:22,686
Seo Yul.

8
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:30,597
Seo Yul!

9
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:17,147
Kid.

10
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:19,777
Where are you?

11
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,087
Come here.

12
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:25,656
Come to me.

13
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,927
Kid, where are you?

14
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:32,897
Kid.

15
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:38,436
Hey.

16
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:43,906
Are you in there?

17
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:45,836
Are you?

18
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:51,077
Here?

19
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:54,746
Oh. Here you are.

20
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,167
Are you looking for this?

21
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:15,767
Give it back.

22
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,577
Give it to me.

23
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,176
I was passing by earlier today...

24
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,106
and saw you come out of here.

25
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:30,017
Are you Yul?

26
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,586
Yes.

27
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:34,487
(Geumsung Realty)

28
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:37,856
You saw something.

29
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:39,857
Like what?

30
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:41,767
You brought back the dead woman's slipper.

31
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,527
People say they think you saw something that day.

32
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:51,236
Did you really see something?

33
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:54,007
Like the killer's face?

34
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:55,607
No.

35
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,076
I only found the slipper.

36
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,046
I didn't even know whose it was.

37
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:04,247
If you did see something, you must be honest.

38
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:07,016
If the killer isn't caught, you might be in danger too.

39
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,727
If you're scared to tell me,

40
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,487
shall we go and talk to your dad?

41
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,256
My gosh.

42
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:55,697
I had a look to see if there was anything interesting.

43
00:05:56,327 --> 00:06:00,167
There were lots of fun things.

44
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,796
Why are those fun?

45
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:04,436
What? Watch it.

46
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,777
Give it back. It's my mom's!

47
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,906
If I don't give it to you or tell your dad...

48
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,776
or give it to the police,

49
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,776
that's what I mean by fun.

50
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,586
What will you do, then?

51
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:19,357
How dare you talk to an adult like that?

52
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:23,057
What will you do, then?

53
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:29,927
Darn it. Did you throw that, woman?

54
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:32,197
I'm not just a woman, I'm a chairwoman!

55
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,796
You punk.

56
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,136
Shoot. Come back here!

57
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:40,576
- Come here! - Follow me.

58
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:41,906
Come this way.

59
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:45,177
Come here. What did he say to you?

60
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:46,977
Don't you say a word!

61
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,416
Will you stop it?

62
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:52,457
Stop it!

63
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,787
Wait. Isn't that my car?

64
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,426
It's him!

65
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:58,856
No. This woman...

66
00:06:58,856 --> 00:06:59,856
Hey, you!

67
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:02,567
Stay right where you are!

68
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:04,427
You...

69
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,396
Darn it.

70
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:08,167
Everyone!

71
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:12,707
It's that way, right?

72
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,217
- Gosh. - Goodness.

73
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:23,146
Didn't I tell you?

74
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:27,057
How could a criminal like him still live in our neighbourhood?

75
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:28,957
He even tried to harm a little girl!

76
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:31,757
- How could I feel safe here? - I never...

77
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,456
- He shoved her with his hand. - He deserved it.

78
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,027
If I hadn't been here...

79
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,096
Seo Yul.

80
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:41,396
Come on. There's a criminal roaming around our neighbourhood.

81
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:44,006
You can't let her go out at night by herself!

82
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,877
Look at her!

83
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:48,206
Did you hurt my little girl?

84
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:49,647
Are you all right?

85
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:52,517
No. I didn't do it.

86
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:53,617
Is he crazy?

87
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:54,946
What's wrong with that guy?

88
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:57,417
This could turn out really badly.

89
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:00,186
Are you okay?

90
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,987
What about your shoes? Are you hurt?

91
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:07,927
What happened?

92
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:11,497
Yul. Tell me what that man did to you.

93
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,397
I don't know what happened.

94
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:15,336
When I came out, she ran to me.

95
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:17,836
And that man was scolding her.

96
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:21,876
Are you okay?

97
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,647
Gosh.

98
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:26,677
- They should arrest him already. - You're okay.

99
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,247
- What's going on? - She's fine.

100
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:32,486
I need to ask her something.

101
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,056
I appreciate your help looking for her.

102
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,286
I'll talk to my daughter.

103
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,426
Okay. Go ahead.

104
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:44,596
This is why...

105
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,396
we can't let some random people into our neighbourhood.

106
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:49,406
How could there be a criminal in our neighbourhood?

107
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:50,806
- Aren't I right? - Right.

108
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:57,946
(MS Mart)

109
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:01,176
So you just let Five Dollars walk away?

110
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:02,187
(Police)

111
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:06,387
To be honest, something about it didn't sit right with me.

112
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,857
Detective Choi had more training than me.

113
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,857
And his performance rate was high too.

114
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:15,897
I trusted him to do his job well.

115
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:17,497
So I thought I was wrong.

116
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,696
I thought it wasn't him this time.

117
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:23,566
We let him go away too easily.

118
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:26,977
(Police)

119
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:30,807
By the looks of it, he must be the culprit.

120
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:37,687
Here.

121
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,457
- No. - What? What is it?

122
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,556
You don't like red beans? Do you want one with veggies?

123
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:49,327
No. I don't think he's the culprit.

124
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,166
Right?

125
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:55,806
That crossed my mind too.

126
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,936
Did you find anything unusual?

127
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:00,737
Listen. If Yul really witnessed it,

128
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:03,676
Yul would have said something when he was arrested...

129
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,476
or hospitalized, wouldn't she?

130
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:08,846
Then he would have had no way out of it.

131
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:12,586
If she was scared, she couldn't have said anything.

132
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:16,186
What if he threatened her because she witnessed the act?

133
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:17,457
Yul was barefoot.

134
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,027
- What? - Barefoot?

135
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:21,757
Yes. As if she had to run away urgently.

136
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:25,697
If Five Dollars took her with him and Yul ran away from him,

137
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:29,007
he wouldn't have let the others see them together.

138
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,166
Right?

139
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,877
She was barefoot?

140
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,276
We should look into that.

141
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:49,157
(Police)

142
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:57,897
What is it?

143
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:02,766
Gosh. What are you doing? Hey!

144
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:06,536
Are you here because of what the old lady said?

145
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:10,476
I was just passing by, and she was really rude.

146
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:12,216
So I was only teaching her a lesson.

147
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,746
No! Don't open that! Come on.

148
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:18,816
Why... Come on. Stop that! Darn it.

149
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,826
So the cops in this neighbourhood don't care about...

150
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,057
my rights or privacy?

151
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:28,596
Fine. Raid my house! Do what you want!

152
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:33,637
What?

153
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,707
What is it that you want from me?

154
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:39,037
What did you do with her shoes?

155
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,677
Why are you looking for her shoes here?

156
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:44,277
Do you think I stole her shoes or something?

157
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:45,977
No. Is that what she's saying?

158
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:48,146
Did she say I stole her shoes?

159
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,456
Come on.

160
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:59,057
Why did you enter my house without a search warrant?

161
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:06,137
(Police)

162
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:09,366
You know what? I took the Civil Service Exam,

163
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:11,036
so I could have a stable job as a cop.

164
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:12,436
So what?

165
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,407
What do you want from me?

166
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:18,447
I don't care about protecting the people or bringing justice.

167
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,847
I got it.

168
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,246
Thanks to you, I managed to get away that time.

169
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:29,087
Help me.

170
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:30,656
Please.

171
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,266
Help me.

172
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,467
Please.

173
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:47,237
Please.

174
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:53,547
Right. I wanted you to run away.

175
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,587
You didn't leave me to die?

176
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:57,686
"Run away and die somewhere else."

177
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,117
"So nothing happened here."

178
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,916
As long as nothing happens here, I was fine.

179
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,327
That's what I thought.

180
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:09,927
That's why when Dae Sung brought you to me,

181
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:14,066
I hoped that you wouldn't be the culprit.

182
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:18,567
So that those two girls didn't die because of me.

183
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:21,206
I didn't kill them! Come on.

184
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:23,077
That better be the case.

185
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:27,776
I might not be great at my job, but I'll be watching you.

186
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,286
But if you are the culprit,

187
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:34,156
I'm going to take responsibility...

188
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:39,026
for letting you go that day.

189
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:42,867
Take responsibility? How will you do that?

190
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:47,596
I mean... You won't have to do that. Gosh. I...

191
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,667
I told you it wasn't me.

192
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:55,036
Then don't cause any more trouble.

193
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:57,676
Live as if you don't exist.

194
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:03,346
Darn it.

195
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,856
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:12,226
Okay. See you tomorrow.

197
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,536
I'm sure there's more than just the shoes.

198
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:27,237
I just don't know what that is.

199
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:33,377
What about the timing?

200
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,046
- What? - Think about it.

201
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:36,817
We considered the possibility...

202
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,287
of her being the witness for the first time...

203
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:39,687
when you were talking to Captain Kim...

204
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,087
at the supermarket earlier. Right?

205
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:42,217
Right.

206
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,686
But Yul went missing today of all days.

207
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,326
Right. You're right.

208
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:50,627
Those murder cases took place days ago.

209
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:53,497
Why did the culprit take Yul today of all days?

210
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:56,907
You and Captain Kim found out Yul witnessed the murder.

211
00:14:57,037 --> 00:14:58,567
So the culprit must have thought...

212
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,807
he would be in danger if you asked her questions.

213
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:04,507
Then it makes sense why the culprit took her today.

214
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:06,947
Either to threaten or hurt her.

215
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,487
Five Dollars didn't know because he didn't come here today.

216
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:12,186
Fish wasn't the culprit.

217
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,187
And the rest of the employees were working here.

218
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:16,956
We're back to square one again.

219
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,026
Gosh.

220
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,296
Or did the culprit have an accomplice?

221
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,766
Then this is going to get complicated.

222
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,067
It's Cheon Kyu.

223
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:30,667
(Geumsung Realty)

224
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,437
Hang on.

225
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,846
How's Yul?

226
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:37,707
She's sleeping now.

227
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,616
Other than that she was scared, she seems fine.

228
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:44,117
Did you get a chance to talk to her?

229
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:47,116
She said she didn't see anything.

230
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,657
But what made you and your son think...

231
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,326
she saw what happened?

232
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,826
She said she never said anything.

233
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:02,136
Well, no. If she didn't, that's great.

234
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:06,076
Keep a close eye on your daughter for the time being. Okay?

235
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:08,036
Shoes!

236
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,347
Shoes!

237
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:11,546
Why are you cursing at me?

238
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:14,877
- Sir, this is Dae Sung. - Hey.

239
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:17,046
I noticed she was barefoot earlier.

240
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:19,956
What about the shoes? Why was she barefoot?

241
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:23,957
Well, that... I actually asked her.

242
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,857
She was playing in a different neighbourhood today.

243
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:28,256
And some bullies must have gotten to her.

244
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,996
They must have taken her shoes for kicks.

245
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:34,466
Anyway, I'm sorry to cause you concern.

246
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,337
Goodnight, then. Bye.

247
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,036
- The shoes... - Wait.

248
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:48,077
No.

249
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,686
Miss, no!

250
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:55,217
You're all right.

251
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:58,357
Did you have a bad dream?

252
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,126
Why did you say "no"?

253
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,427
Who is she?

254
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,796
It's okay. You can tell me.

255
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:09,667
Tell me.

256
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,367
Did you see something?

257
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:13,776
Is anyone bothering you about that?

258
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,506
I was dreaming.

259
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:21,177
There was a girl in my dream.

260
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:24,047
And there was a monster.

261
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:27,886
I see.

262
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:35,297
When is Mom coming back?

263
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:45,806
If you behave and be a good girl,

264
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:46,806
she'll be back soon.

265
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,576
It's time to go to bed.

266
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:56,847
Yul.

267
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,817
Don't go to the supermarket too much alone.

268
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,587
Don't stay alone with the supermarket guy.

269
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:04,387
Don't take anything from him.

270
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,256
Why not?

271
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:09,766
When an adult male is nice to you,

272
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,166
you should always be careful.

273
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,997
If the supermarket guy asks you anything...

274
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:16,036
or tries to see your skin under your clothes,

275
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:18,106
you have to tell me, okay?

276
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:19,407
Yes.

277
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:27,146
Do you think we can trust what Yul said?

278
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:29,446
She seems eloquent...

279
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:32,147
and inquisitive,

280
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:35,316
but she won't open her heart.

281
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:37,256
You think so?

282
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:39,996
She even comes to buy alcohol for her dad.

283
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:40,996
She's a shrewd girl.

284
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:46,497
Don't you think she's been way too fine?

285
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:48,536
What?

286
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:51,036
When I first saw a dead body,

287
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:52,606
it wasn't murder,

288
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:54,307
but I was still shocked for a while.

289
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:56,647
In fact, I'm the police.

290
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:00,116
But if a child saw a dead person...

291
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:02,076
or something horrible,

292
00:19:02,617 --> 00:19:06,157
her dad or anyone would've noticed.

293
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:10,787
What are you thinking?

294
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:11,786
Nothing.

295
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:15,196
Let's trust what Yul said.

296
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,936
You'll still keep your eyes on her, right?

297
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:25,306
Of course.

298
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,777
My goodness.

299
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,347
It's tough, isn't it?

300
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,516
Do you want to stop?

301
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:40,187
It would've been perfect if Five Dollars was the culprit.

302
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:44,056
Because you wanted to check if he was bad enough...

303
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:46,496
to kill someone?

304
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:48,226
No.

305
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,366
It's painful to suspect other employees, isn't it?

306
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,006
How will I face Fish tomorrow?

307
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,036
What?

308
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:25,066
What?

309
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:27,375
If you want to say something, just tell me already.

310
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:28,806
Say something? Me?

311
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,276
I have nothing to say.

312
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:36,815
(Domestic scallop)

313
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:47,325
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,296
You apologized already yesterday.

315
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,625
About sneaking into your house...

316
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,666
and suspecting you as the culprit.

317
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,905
Also about being biased.

318
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,976
Sorry about everything.

319
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,546
Okay. You can stop now.

320
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,475
Buy everything you just touched.

321
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:09,146
Okay.

322
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:12,415
We can grill them tomorrow.

323
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:14,416
We missed your welcome party.

324
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,786
Let's keep it simple and have it between you, me,

325
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:18,785
Meat, and my girlfriend.

326
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,155
And grill some meat on the rooftop.

327
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,495
Sure.

328
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,205
Why is this so expensive?

329
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:43,445
In the US, when someone moves in,

330
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:46,386
they receive documents about...

331
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:48,316
one's job, family, financial state, and stuff like that...

332
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:51,225
to evaluate and interview that person.

333
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,896
The US is different.

334
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,296
Ms. Chairwoman. How do you know all that?

335
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:59,425
My daughter lives in San Francisco.

336
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,836
I knew it.

337
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:06,475
Koreans all go crazy about making money...

338
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:08,976
through redevelopment.

339
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:12,146
Even though a criminal is walking around, no one cares.

340
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:13,216
Look what happened to our neighbourhood.

341
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:16,016
I know. I was scared yesterday.

342
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:19,385
So we should hold an emergency building representative meeting...

343
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:23,016
and kick out that Five Dollars or Five Cents or something.

344
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:26,255
But he's not the murderer.

345
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:29,965
The fact there's a murderer in this town...

346
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:31,426
creeps me out.

347
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:33,836
- Have you heard? - What?

348
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,335
The murderer killed a person...

349
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,365
and in the supermarket...

350
00:22:37,966 --> 00:22:39,336
I heard that too.

351
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:41,776
- That was his son. - Shush.

352
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:43,575
But it's true.

353
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,546
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

354
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:50,046
Oh, my hands slipped.

355
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,445
I'm all wet.

356
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:54,956
You sure are. You should go and change.

357
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,956
You're so annoying.

358
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:57,886
You don't even apologize?

359
00:22:57,886 --> 00:22:58,886
But I'm not sorry at all.

360
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:00,456
- What? - That's not even ridiculous.

361
00:23:00,456 --> 00:23:01,456
Seriously.

362
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:02,856
What were you saying about my son?

363
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:05,225
- The rumour says... - Stop it.

364
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:06,596
It's just a rumour.

365
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,995
Calm down. This will only make matters...

366
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:10,005
I'm not selling anything to you!

367
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:13,335
Don't ever come back here.

368
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:15,505
Don't you use my supermarket!

369
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:17,245
That's not the only supermarket.

370
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:18,945
That's ridiculous.

371
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,016
Seriously.

372
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,245
I could just...

373
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:28,915
You don't believe those rumours, do you?

374
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:31,656
I never even heard of it before.

375
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:34,296
Who would gossip about Dae Sung in front of me?

376
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:36,725
Everyone knows about us.

377
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:40,635
What? "Us"?

378
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:42,635
Oh, that reminds me,

379
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:46,436
I was going to check on Yul.

380
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:50,876
Get me some mandarines and snacks for her.

381
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:53,575
What does she like?

382
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:55,376
What?

383
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:59,015
What are you doing?

384
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:00,155
Can't you see?

385
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:02,356
Do it properly.

386
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,995
(MS Mart)

387
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:15,035
We got to know each other,

388
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:17,465
but we're not there yet.

389
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,606
Read the room.

390
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,175
I have something to tell you. Come here.

391
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:22,876
(MS Mart)

392
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:28,575
(Freezer)

393
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,586
What is it?

394
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:34,786
- About Meat. - Yes.

395
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:37,485
Was he on your suspect list?

396
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:39,126
What?

397
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:40,396
You were looking for a culprit.

398
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,096
You checked that it's not me.

399
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:45,925
You think the culprit is in the supermarket.

400
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:52,835
Are you sure it's okay for Meat...

401
00:24:53,736 --> 00:24:56,076
to keep walking Veggie home?

402
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:00,745
Do you...

403
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:02,845
know anything?

404
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:10,756
Tell your husband to come pick you up.

405
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,386
What?

406
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:15,896
He works overtime every day.

407
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:17,595
He's busy.

408
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,666
I'll take it.

409
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:30,576
It's so pretty.

410
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:32,375
Oh, I thought it was something serious.

411
00:25:33,646 --> 00:25:36,046
I know that Meat likes Veggie.

412
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:38,986
He's not supposed to though.

413
00:25:39,486 --> 00:25:40,686
But it's not...

414
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:43,556
Pantyhose and tampons.

415
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,156
Did Meat buy it or not?

416
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:47,825
He did, but...

417
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:50,525
Among people who bought those,

418
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:53,535
you suspected me the most, didn't you?

419
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,505
Meat is the only guy left in the supermarket.

420
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:05,145
Until we know it's not him, I think Veggie could be in danger.

421
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:24,395
You might slice your own hand.

422
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:28,496
(MS Mart)

423
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:30,505
Did anything happen when you walked Veggie home yesterday?

424
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,436
No.

425
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:34,475
Why are you so glum?

426
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:36,635
Do you wish something would happen?

427
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,276
What are you saying?

428
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,745
Will you keep walking her home?

429
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:45,345
If a man has drawn a blade, he must at least cut fat.

430
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:51,885
Shall I come too?

431
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:53,995
What for?

432
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:55,796
What?

433
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:00,636
If the killer's really after her, can you handle him on your own?

434
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:03,196
- Couldn't I? - Two would be better.

435
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:05,436
Two would be better.

436
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:07,676
Me and Veggie. Two.

437
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,335
Get a grip.

438
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,676
Quit talking nonsense and go away.

439
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:13,616
Must I protect you too?

440
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:20,355
(MS Mart)

441
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:29,455
(MS Mart)

442
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:34,335
(Fast, free delivery)

443
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,366
Please help me out.

444
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,035
There's really nothing I can do for you.

445
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:41,506
Yul.

446
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:44,546
Would you like one of these?

447
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,616
It's organic. Take a sip.

448
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,546
What a good girl.

449
00:27:57,825 --> 00:28:00,255
I brought some food for Yul.

450
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:01,795
What?

451
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:03,865
I feel sorry for the kid.

452
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:07,165
She barely eats because her mom's away.

453
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,436
I took her in and fed her once.

454
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:12,706
She ate meat like she starved for days.

455
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:13,806
Ms. Chairwoman!

456
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:20,515
Yul just loves meat.

457
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,245
I'm feeding her well enough. Don't worry and take this...

458
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:27,485
Which hospital is her mom at?

459
00:28:27,616 --> 00:28:29,586
A woman needs a woman's help.

460
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,355
I'll go and ask her if she needs anything...

461
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:34,625
My gosh. Look at how hard you're trying.

462
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:37,366
- What? - You're trying to drive down...

463
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:39,896
the price of the apartment someone was killed in to buy it.

464
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:41,096
Everyone knows.

465
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,106
As if it would be nice for your son and his new wife...

466
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,865
move into a place like that.

467
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:48,975
It would be nice if they were to live close so I can visit every day.

468
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:52,206
Don't brag about your daughter being in the US.

469
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,746
She hasn't visited her old mom in years.

470
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:57,785
So what if you speak in a foreign accent...

471
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,116
because you can?

472
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:01,185
You've never been invited over.

473
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:03,756
It looks like you're not welcome at all.

474
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,525
Darn you.

475
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:11,496
- Let go. - You let go.

476
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:16,265
You want to pick a fight with me?

477
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:18,666
Shall we? Shall we fight?

478
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:22,205
Why are you just sitting there? Stop her.

479
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:23,746
How could you?

480
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:25,275
Darn you!

481
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:29,116
You care so little about others.

482
00:29:29,116 --> 00:29:32,216
That's why you didn't care about an empty house using electricity.

483
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:35,285
I called you after work, but you didn't check, did you?

484
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,325
If homeowners turn against you,

485
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:40,085
you'll lose business in no time!

486
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:45,766
Dad. I'm hungry.

487
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:47,635
Oh, dear.

488
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:52,606
Are you hungry?

489
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:55,336
Shall I buy you pork cutlet?

490
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:57,676
Yes. I want some.

491
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:00,245
Let's go, then.

492
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,416
- Shall I come along? - You don't have to...

493
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,616
Take this and leave.

494
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,985
- Keep my gifts. - Goodness.

495
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,056
You took what I give you.

496
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,356
My goodness.

497
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:14,195
Let's eat pork cutlet together.

498
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:17,265
- Stop it. - It's your fault.

499
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:21,595
(Glue Sticks)

500
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:22,865
Why didn't you buy this during the staff sale?

501
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,506
I have my reasons.

502
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:27,605
- Are you leaving now? - Yes. Why?

503
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,846
If you have more to do, I can walk home alone.

504
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:34,675
No. Let's go. I was about to leave.

505
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:37,346
How much is it?

506
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:38,716
A dollar.

507
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,726
Meat has been preoccupied with Veggie all day today.

508
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:53,226
- What if something happens? - As if.

509
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:55,396
Don't say something that scary.

510
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:57,305
All I was suggesting...

511
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,735
is that they could fall in love.

512
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,236
That's scary in another way.

513
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,805
Should I have offered to take her home?

514
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:28,966
Careful.

515
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,216
Wait up.

516
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,496
What is it?

517
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:02,766
What?

518
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,336
I feel like someone's staring at us.

519
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,876
I don't think there's anyone else.

520
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,646
This won't do. Shall I walk you to the third-floor entrance?

521
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:19,946
No, it's fine. I'll be okay.

522
00:32:22,886 --> 00:32:25,726
How do you know I live on the third floor?

523
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:27,325
What?

524
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,436
What's going on?

525
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:38,836
There's something I must tell you.

526
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:40,435
What is it?

527
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:43,076
What do you want to say? Let me go first.

528
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:44,175
Don't do it.

529
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:46,676
Is he insane?

530
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,286
You can tell me. I know everything.

531
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:55,615
Why are you scaring me? Let go.

532
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,686
You can stop walking me home now.

533
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:01,796
Wait.

534
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:21,316
It has to be love.

535
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:07,756
Please come and save me.

536
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:14,056
(Nawoo-ro 2ra-Gil)

537
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:15,256
(Police)

538
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:20,126
Are you sure it's not Meat?

539
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:24,406
Am I sure? Well, no.

540
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,035
I'm not sure.

541
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:29,975
But I saw him walk away.

542
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:34,345
He couldn't have gone back.

543
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:54,835
It's the police.

544
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:57,195
It's me, A Hee.

545
00:35:58,505 --> 00:35:59,765
Are you in there?

546
00:36:00,036 --> 00:36:01,136
Hello?

547
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:14,356
You're all right now.

548
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,555
Tell me what happened.

549
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:24,166
Someone pressed the passcode and came into my house.

550
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:28,266
Then you probably didn't see his face.

551
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:30,096
Not at all.

552
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,235
Not even his voice?

553
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:36,405
Did you call your husband?

554
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:42,346
Why not?

555
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:45,746
He went to the Philippines for his business.

556
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:48,185
But still. You should call him given the gravity of the situation!

557
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:49,185
Officer Do.

558
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,135
(Meat)

559
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,645
Please pick up.

(MS Mart)

562
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,311
Why is it so chilly today?

563
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:31,711
(Hard Working Police Officers for the People)

564
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:37,282
Watch out for cars.

565
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,062
What? Your skin is glowing.

566
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:45,161
Did you do something?

567
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,261
Gosh, no.

568
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:49,391
Put them on your cheeks.

569
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:52,232
They are so warm.

570
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,171
It's so good.

571
00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:03,041
I want a bigger one.

572
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:04,741
I can't stay out for long.

573
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:05,982
When will you get the fingerprint results...

574
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:07,612
from Veggie's house?

575
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:10,851
Tomorrow?

576
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,052
It's not an urgent case.

577
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:16,692
Don't forget our party with Meat and Fish tonight on the rooftop.

578
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,791
I know.

579
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:19,462
Go and share this with your colleagues.

580
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:21,862
Thank you.

581
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,301
A Hee.

582
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:27,372
Don't get hurt.

583
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:29,671
Same to you. Don't get hurt.

584
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,302
And don't cause trouble behind my back.

585
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:36,271
Watch out for cars.

586
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,261
I can't do it.

587
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:57,262
What?

588
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:01,002
Would you like to take a day off? Or do you want...

589
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:02,971
a few days off?

590
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,571
I don't know.

591
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,411
You can't leave my position vacant.

592
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:14,282
- Hire someone to replace me. - Hey.

593
00:40:14,282 --> 00:40:17,482
Hey, can we talk for a moment?

594
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:22,121
I don't know what you want to talk about.

595
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,651
But you can call her later. Okay?

596
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:24,962
She has a lot on her plate now.

597
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,491
- I'm quitting. - Hey.

598
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,592
I'll go away for the time being.

599
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,901
What if the murderer is after me this time?

600
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,771
I'm so scared.

601
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,071
Okay. Do as you please.

602
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:55,591
My goodness. Look at that.

603
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:58,722
Have you been slacking off lately? Your lower body needs more muscles.

604
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:01,831
Get back to work.

605
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:04,731
Can you handle the produce section for the time being?

606
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:34,431
Hey, why is everyone like that to me?

607
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:35,431
You didn't pay for this.

608
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:38,562
- Hey. - Don't smoke.

609
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:40,261
It was hard for you to quit.

610
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:48,342
What's going on?

611
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:50,172
Why didn't you answer your phone last night?

612
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,711
I was drawing.

613
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:53,141
At home?

614
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:56,112
Then do you think I went outside to draw the landscape at night?

615
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,791
- What are you doing after work? - Why do you ask?

616
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:04,191
Let's grill some meat on the rooftop to welcome Fish to the store.

617
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:06,692
I'm not close to that guy. And nor you.

618
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,292
That's why we should get to know him.

619
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,631
Don't leave after work. Come to the rooftop right away.

620
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,002
Bring us rib eye. It's on me.

621
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:17,172
Hey. But...

622
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,172
did you see my sketchbook?

623
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:20,172
Your sketchbook?

624
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,282
- What are you doing? - Me?

625
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,682
Meat asked me to bring something.

(Yang Joon Ho)

627
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:39,862
No, I didn't.

628
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:48,371
So...

629
00:42:56,572 --> 00:42:59,412
How come no one is listening to me?

630
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,511

632
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:04,851
Gosh.

633
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:09,891
Where could the electrical leakage be?

634
00:43:13,061 --> 00:43:14,731
This is crazy.

635
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:17,761
What if a homeless person is living here?

636
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,561
Gosh. What is my neighbourhood turning into?

637
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,522
Is someone moving into this house soon?

638
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,351
Someone must have cleaned the house before moving in.

639
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:45,962
Why is the fridge so big?

640
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,141
My goodness.

641
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,012
- Mom. - Yes?

642
00:44:01,512 --> 00:44:02,942
Can I leave work early today?

643
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:04,781
To do what?

644
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,082
I feel awful for what we did to Fish.

645
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:10,721
We've known other employees here for a long time.

646
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:12,521
But we didn't know anything about him.

647
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,791
So we're going to grill meat with A Hee today.

648
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,321
Drinks are on me then.

649
00:44:16,992 --> 00:44:17,992
Okay.

650
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:21,161
Hey.

Come upstairs. Okay?

655
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:45,982
Come up.

656
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:53,461

Hi, Yul.

Are you looking for anything?

660
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:23,191
Oh, the slipper?

661
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,591
It's not in there anymore.

662
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:26,922
The police took it.

663
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,131
I see.

664
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:33,462
But I'm not here for the slipper.

665
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:35,131
I'm here to buy something.

666
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,502
Really? What are you getting?

667
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,511
Did you eat?

668
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:45,281
Do you want some chocolate?

669
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:51,851
Where did Veggie lady go?

670
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:54,191
Well,

671
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:57,761
something bad happened to her. She's taking a break.

672
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:01,831
Does she think she's safe outside the supermarket?

673
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:04,301
What? What do you mean?

674
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:10,002
Young Chun. What's that?

675
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,101
Honey.

676
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:12,902
Help me.

677
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:14,002
What's that?

(MS Mart)

679
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:16,671
Meat.

680
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:18,742
- Okay. Come here. - Put it over here.

681
00:46:20,012 --> 00:46:21,352
- We should... - What are you doing?

682
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:26,182
Things won't go well in the market.

683
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:28,851
I didn't do it on purpose,

684
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:31,661
but I lost my temper and scared people.

685
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:32,791
So?

686
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:35,691
I came up with a new business idea.

687
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:38,961
The stationery store nearby is closing soon.

688
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:41,372
He was selling that dirt cheap.

689
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:45,101
Apparently, that's good money.

690
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:49,842
You didn't come up with it.

691
00:46:49,971 --> 00:46:51,841
The stationery store owner probably talked you into it.

692
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:54,512
So? How much is dirt cheap?

693
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:58,221
In three months, I can get my money's worth.

694
00:46:58,451 --> 00:47:01,491
In three months, this place might be closing.

695
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:03,691
Then that will be the only thing...

696
00:47:03,692 --> 00:47:05,462
you have left.

697
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:08,432
I will make that two months.

698
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:10,461
One.

699
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:12,731
Anyone has coins?

700
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,001
What are you doing?

701
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:16,831
Finish your work and go home.

702
00:47:17,072 --> 00:47:18,242
Okay.

703
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,072
Let's move it.

704
00:47:32,451 --> 00:47:33,521
Do you want to try?

705
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,151
Which one do you want?

706
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:38,391
- This one. - This? Okay.

707
00:47:39,092 --> 00:47:41,932
- Can I insert it? - Sure.

708
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:44,262
Anyone can pick this,

709
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,862
but not anyone can insert it in there.

710
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,201
Here we go.

711
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:53,101
Make my money's worth, pup.

712
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,342
All right.

713
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:59,181
Everything will be okay.

714
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:01,181
Okay.

715
00:48:07,922 --> 00:48:09,022
Did you insert it?

716
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:10,791
Okay.

717
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,961
Here. Give it a try.

718
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:19,801
You're the first customer.

719
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,431
Here.

720
00:48:23,371 --> 00:48:26,571
You got it.

721
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:29,571
Make your money's worth, my foot.

722
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:31,242
Here. Try one more time.

723
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,311
Oh, you're here.

724
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,522
Here. Have a seat.

725
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,391
You know Fish, right?

726
00:48:42,822 --> 00:48:45,292
You've met A Hee before. My girlfriend.

727
00:48:50,331 --> 00:48:52,261
Let's grill some scallops.

728
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:05,412
I have a question.

729
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:09,252
What is it?

730
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:11,451
You didn't say anything to me.

731
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:13,421
What is it?

732
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,321
And you said you were sorry.

733
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:16,891
Do you still suspect me?

734
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:18,561
Not him. It's me.

735
00:49:18,561 --> 00:49:19,821
It's not suspicion. It's a question.

736
00:49:19,992 --> 00:49:21,532
Is it about...

737
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:23,191
- my criminal record? - Your makeup...

738
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:25,462
- Criminal record? - Makeup?

739
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:26,901
I only wanted to...

740
00:49:27,561 --> 00:49:30,001
ask you about your makeup...

741
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:32,101
because you have good makeup skills.

742
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:35,571
I meant to tell you about my criminal record.

743
00:49:36,212 --> 00:49:39,112
You probably suspected me for that reason.

744
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:42,852
Well, that's kind of true.

745
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:45,722
Lee Kyung A died in her own house.

746
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:48,221
I thought it'd be easy for you to pick the lock...

747
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:49,721
since you're an ex-convict.

748
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:51,391
I don't know what you stole.

749
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,562
- You could be a pervert... - But he's not.

750
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:59,101
Don't get into details. It's nothing nice.

751
00:50:00,802 --> 00:50:02,402
I didn't pick a lock.

752
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:04,441
It all happened at my home.

753
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:06,202
What?

754
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:10,212
The bike belonged to my parents who ran a Chinese restaurant.

755
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:12,141
Other two times were...

756
00:50:12,882 --> 00:50:15,112
cash at home and my mom's ring.

757
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:17,012
Your parents reported you for that?

758
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:18,521
They didn't reach a deal?

759
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:21,251
I wasn't going to tell my parents,

760
00:50:23,192 --> 00:50:25,422
but they'd find out anyway when I get the surgery.

761
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:27,691
So I came out.

762
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,692
Then they put me in the prayer house.

763
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,931
Shaved my head and locked me up at home.

764
00:50:33,962 --> 00:50:36,002
They tried to take me to the asylum.

765
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:38,402
So I ran away from home three times.

766
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:42,271
I thought that will do...

767
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:44,741
for my labour at their restaurant.

768
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,212
But your parents reported you?

769
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,811
To make you come home?

770
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:51,382
No, to fix me.

771
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,652
That upsets me every time.

772
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:55,592
Did you know about that?

773
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:59,922
Doo Hyun told me about it before coming here.

774
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,331
He said he saw me checking his criminal record.

775
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:04,561
He told me not to take it wrong.

776
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:26,552
Eat up. It's warm.

777
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,051
Here. Eat some.

778
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:31,021
It's hot.

779
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,221
- Do you like it? - Yes.

780
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:35,192
Try it. Eat.

781
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:44,501
Sorry...

782
00:51:45,742 --> 00:51:46,842
about suspecting you.

783
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:49,342
You were trying to catch a culprit...

784
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:52,741
and save the child. I don't mind.

785
00:51:53,012 --> 00:51:54,212
Doesn't it bug you...

786
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:58,351
that I'm a transgender?

787
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:00,422
You don't mind as long as I'm not a murderer?

788
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:02,422
Oh, right. That reminds me.

789
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:04,662
What?

790
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:07,121
What do you use for your makeup?

791
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,261
How do you do that?

792
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,442
I'll show you.

793
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:24,111
- This is what I use. - Okay.

794
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:28,011
- Here. - This is it?

795
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:30,082
I didn't know about this.

796
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,122
Here.

797
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:38,661
Meat told me to give it to you.

798
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:41,231
- Where is he? - He said he'll come later.

799
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:42,892
He wasn't in the mood for dinner.

800
00:52:43,462 --> 00:52:44,532
How much is it?

801
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:47,361
I have to pay you for delivery, don't I?

802
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:50,831
I'm here for dinner.

803
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,541
Really? You never showed up for dinner before.

804
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:55,641
It's been a while since I had beef.

805
00:53:08,692 --> 00:53:09,992
Are you close to A Hee?

806
00:53:12,092 --> 00:53:13,222
Since when?

807
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,061
Are you close to Fish?

808
00:53:16,262 --> 00:53:17,432
Since when did you talk casually?

809
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:18,802
- We're not. - We're not.

810
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,632
That reminds me. Fish doesn't use honorifics to you.

811
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:26,071
You're right. It was so smooth that I never noticed.

812
00:53:26,242 --> 00:53:27,272
Why did you do that?

813
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,211
You think he's a pushover?

814
00:53:30,212 --> 00:53:31,442
- Kind of. - Kind of.

815
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,711
You little...

816
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:36,252
No. I just didn't know what to call him.

817
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:38,851
That's true.

818
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:40,152
You can't call me a bro...

819
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:41,922
or brother...

820
00:53:45,262 --> 00:53:47,392
When we're not close, it's best to talk casually.

821
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,431
Let's be fair like Americans.

822
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:51,531
Hurry up and eat...

823
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:53,262
or she's going to eat everything.

824
00:53:54,101 --> 00:53:55,831
Take your time. Eat.

825
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,241
- Let's have some meat. - Okay.

826
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:07,181
Call Meat.

827
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:08,751
This is never enough.

828
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:10,181
Tell him to bring more meat.

829
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:15,852
(Meat)

830
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:27,031
- Why isn't he picking up? - The person you have reached...

831
00:54:48,492 --> 00:54:50,592
People know that I'm here.

832
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:52,091
My daughter knows it too.

833
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:55,762
If I don't go back home, she'll call the police...

834
00:54:56,992 --> 00:55:00,402
I won't tell anyone about what I saw.

835
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:03,001
Don't kill me. Please don't!

836
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:05,601
Save me!

837
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:10,271
Then...

838
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:14,112
did you all live here all your lives?

839
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,481
Yes. Meat and I are elementary, middle, and high school friends.

840
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:19,581
A Hee was a few years below us.

841
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:20,821
She's a bit below A Hee.

842
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:23,491
This place is like that.

843
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:25,891
Most were born and raised here,

844
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:28,031
and all know each other.

845
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:29,592
Let's drink.

846
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:30,932
Take your time.

847
00:55:32,931 --> 00:55:33,931
Just half a shot.

848
00:55:36,271 --> 00:55:37,971
I'm sick of this place.

849
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,971
Hey. What's there to be sick about?

850
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:42,441
It's so unfamiliar.

851
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:48,712
I thought this neighbourhood was peaceful.

852
00:55:49,152 --> 00:55:50,282
Back then,

853
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:54,321
when you defeated Five Dollars in your store.

854
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,421
That's when I decided to become an officer...

855
00:55:57,422 --> 00:55:59,122
to guard the neighbourhood.

856
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:02,231
See? It's boring.

857
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:04,232
Who becomes their childhood dream?

858
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:06,602
Or still date the person they liked in school.

859
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:09,431
I prefer things to be constant like that.

860
00:56:12,672 --> 00:56:13,802
But...

861
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:17,971
since I became an officer,

862
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,551
this place seems unfamiliar.

863
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:23,212
It's a jungle.

864
00:56:23,552 --> 00:56:25,922
Everyone's weird and suspicious.

865
00:56:26,221 --> 00:56:27,921
Everyone has a secret.

866
00:56:27,922 --> 00:56:30,122
You lived a sheltered life.

867
00:56:30,492 --> 00:56:31,492
Darn you.

868
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:35,332
What...

869
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:40,432
must I do to stop bad things from happening?

870
00:56:40,902 --> 00:56:44,732
What can I even do? I have no idea.

871
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:49,872
I feel like a child who doesn't know anything.

872
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:56,851
Oh, no.

873
00:56:57,382 --> 00:56:58,652
A Hee, go to the toilet.

874
00:56:58,652 --> 00:56:59,682
Help her.

875
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:02,221
- Hang on. - I want to puke.

876
00:57:02,221 --> 00:57:04,321
You can. But in the toilet.

877
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:05,921
Not yet.

878
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,482
I should give this back.

879
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,061
Why does he draw stuff that doesn't suit him?

880
00:57:57,742 --> 00:57:59,112
Isn't this Veggie?

881
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:03,951
Dae Sung.

882
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,622
I need to change.

883
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:06,621
Okay.

884
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:10,052
- You got wet? - Yes.

885
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,491
You might feel cold.

886
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:14,791
I'll be fine.

887
00:58:19,201 --> 00:58:20,261
Is this...

888
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:23,502
what I think it is?

889
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:27,141
Mom, no. It's not what you're thinking.

890
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:28,411
It's not that.

891
00:58:28,411 --> 00:58:29,411
Mother.

892
00:58:29,612 --> 00:58:30,972
I get that you might be fired up,

893
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:32,781
but at least send the others away first.

894
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:34,482
We're not fired up for anything.

895
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:35,682
Fine, then.

896
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:37,551
What do I care?

897
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,182
- Deliver this for me. - At this hour?

898
00:58:41,181 --> 00:58:42,621
- Yes. - I had alcohol.

899
00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:44,851
Then walk it off.

900
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:46,061
I have to...

901
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:48,391
deal with your troublemaker Dad.

902
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,391
If I go to see Mr. Kim tomorrow,

903
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:53,932
he'll say refunds are only done the same day.

904
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:55,501
- What do you mean? - Mother.

905
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:58,171
Is there a problem? Do you need my help?

906
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,972
No, it's fine.

907
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,941
You can stay here and have more fun and alcohol.

908
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:05,881
Come and drink with us, then.

909
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:07,441
What?

910
00:59:07,442 --> 00:59:09,152
- This... - Get going, Dae Sung.

911
00:59:17,322 --> 00:59:18,822
Hello.

912
00:59:49,391 --> 00:59:50,921
- Thank you. - Bye.

913
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:58,461
- What? - I want a chewy snack!

914
00:59:58,462 --> 00:59:59,762
Aren't you full?

915
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,132
- Get me a chewy snack! - A chewy snack?

916
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,202
- She should do an eating show. - Okay, I'll get some.

917
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,501
Fatty's the best!

918
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:22,252
(The Killer's Shopping List)

919
01:00:38,342 --> 01:00:39,342
A chewy snack?

920
01:00:43,471 --> 01:00:45,541
You were at Cho Yang Soon's crime scene, right?

921
01:00:46,382 --> 01:00:47,382
We have a witness.

922
01:00:49,382 --> 01:00:50,852
When Meat goes out,

923
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:52,222

924

925
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:56,752
will it change the suspect list?

926
01:00:58,891 --> 01:00:59,891
(Quick Drain Cleaner)

927
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:02,931
- You know what this is, don't you? - No!

928
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:05,631

929
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,171
I'm sorry, Dae Sung.

930
01:01:13,672 --> 01:01:14,672
It was you.
