THIS DRAMA IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.

00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,080
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,920
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED
FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,960
I'll help you get pregnant
in exchange for…

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,000
your gold.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,400
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,160
I want to use the devil
Goddess Som gave me.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,440
But if you fail, forget Devil Chan

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,760
and use other devils. Promise me.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
I promise.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,120
It must be a coincidence
that we look alike.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,400
I will come back to find you again.

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,120
The devil-hunters have returned.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,880
<i>She hasn’t learned her lesson.</i>

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,760
<i>What are you going to do next, my Queen?</i>

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,960
You gave birth to a devil.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,360
As all of us know,

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
Laplae

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,040
no longer has
the Lady Guardian named Angkab.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,440
Eungpueng

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,480
will be the next Lady Guardian.

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
Just and fair Goddess Som,

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
this is a great loss.

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,960
My dear friend

25
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,760
has gone forever, never to return.

26
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,800
No matter how much I love my friend,

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,880
I cannot allow the honor
of Goddess Som to be trampled upon.

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,600
Forgive me Goddess Som,

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,080
and please bring peace

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,320
back to our land.

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Goddess Som, show us your mercy.

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,840
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Goddess Som, show us your mercy.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,120
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

35
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,160
What is that Som Po?

36
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,760
It's called the Hong Haeng flower.

37
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,360
I'll make medicine for you.

38
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,840
This Hong Haeng flower is very useful.

39
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,880
Even though it’s bland and a bit oily,
it’s very cooling.

40
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,800
If you have a fever,
Hong Haeng can draw out the poison.

41
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,160
I think you could be a healer,

42
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,480
like a traditional healer,

43
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,800
using herbs to make medicine
and treat people in the villages.

44
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,760
That’s not a great merit,

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
my mother doesn’t like it.

46
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
What is a great merit then?

47
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,960
Having a daughter.

48
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,880
Why not just go to the blacksmiths
and get it over with?

49
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,560
Right? I don't know either.

50
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,440
It feels strange,
my stomach is all twisted up.

51
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,720
I just can’t do it.

52
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,840
I was…

53
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,840
only thinking about your face.

54
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,560
Well, like I told you,

55
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,360
for a man and a woman to copulate,
they must first be in love.

56
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,920
My friends slept with blacksmiths.
I didn't see any love between them.

57
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,080
Just one look into each other’s eyes,
and they go into the tall grass together.

58
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
And how did they
look into each other's eyes?

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,480
They did it like this.

60
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Are you pregnant?

61
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,560
Pregnancy isn’t like eating breakfast
and then having results by evening.

62
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,600
You’ll have to wait until tomorrow.

63
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,240
Then where are you going?

64
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm going to look for my friend.

65
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,000
Your friend probably
went home with a baby.

66
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,480
Why would she be walking here?

67
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,080
How can she go back to Laplae?
You stole her golden turmeric.

68
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,200
Mother? How is she here?

69
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,039
‪Hey!

70
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,280
Ouch.

71
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,680
Be careful. Why such a hurry?

72
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
Where did she disappear?

73
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,640
Who disappeared?

74
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh, you thought it was your friend?

75
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,600
Well, what's your friend's name?

76
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,760
- Som Po.
- Som Po.

77
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,240
Kahla and Som Po. Your names are flowers.

78
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,880
Don't tell me everyone in your town
is named after a flower?

79
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,080
Then, what's your mother's name?

80
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,640
Has anyone told you?

81
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,880
About what?

82
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
That you talk a lot.

83
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,560
And why are you following me?

84
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
- I'm helping you find your friend.
- Aw…

85
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,480
Ouch.

86
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,200
Are you annoyed?

87
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,320
There's a letter from Phra Nakhon to you.

88
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,760
What's the order Sir?

89
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,720
Please,

90
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,200
don't let it be to survey
the route Mr. Henry went.

91
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,000
If that's the order, I'll leave.

92
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,680
There's an order to delay
the new route survey

93
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
and stay here for now.

94
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Then, that means

95
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,600
I don't have to do anything yet, right?

96
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,320
Why not Am?

97
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,360
Prepare something important for me.

98
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,760
Som Po, stay still.

99
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,960
What are you doing?

100
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
Don't move.

101
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,160
Alright. You're done.

102
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
You can move now.

103
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,760
Hehe.

104
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,080
Is that wooden box
the one drawing my image?

105
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,600
Drawing isn't the right word.

106
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,200
Actually, that box emits light

107
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,680
onto a light-sensitive material
for a period of time,

108
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,440
and when the light hits it,
it leaves an imprint on the material,

109
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,120
creating the drawing you see.

110
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,120
I don't understand.

111
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,160
Then, who are the devil
and the two ladies here?

112
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,520
That's my family.

113
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,000
My father, my mother, and my sister.

114
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,760
It's so strange out here.

115
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,200
Devils live with ladies.

116
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,480
It's not strange.

117
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,280
Look at that.

118
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,920
Do you want this one?

119
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,080
Tell me more about the drawing box

120
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,360
or the things in your town.

121
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,600
In Phra Nakhon, there are a lot of people.

122
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
The entire town is illuminated

123
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,360
at night by lanterns that never go out.

124
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,840
Lanterns that never go out?

125
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,320
I want to see them.

126
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,680
Soon, there will be a train here

127
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
that runs as fast as 50 horses,

128
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,640
and when that train arrives,
prosperity will follow.

129
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,120
And, is it going to be long

130
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,360
until your train arrives?

131
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,080
Yes,

132
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,040
but it won’t be too long.

133
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,040
I really want to see it with my own eyes.

134
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Will we forget everything
outside of Laplae?

135
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,600
Yes, the good and the bad,
you’ll forget it all.

136
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
Oh.

137
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,960
Will I forget my name and what I've done?

138
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Well…

139
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,600
just a small amount
of the purifying antidote

140
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,560
won't make you forget your family.

141
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,120
You'll just forget
what's outside of Laplae.

142
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,640
I want to forget the vile devil.

143
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,240
That's it. That's the importance
of the purifying antidote.

144
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,480
It makes us forget
all the bad things in the outside world

145
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,440
and be happy as we always are.

146
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't worry.

147
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,160
All the devil-hunters
who returned to the town

148
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,040
have drunk the purifying antidote.

149
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
Drink the purifying antidote,

150
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,720
and you‘ll return to the embrace
of Goddess Som as before.

151
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,000
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

152
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,880
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

153
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,160
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

154
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,360
You've done a great job as devil-hunters.

155
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,120
And from now on,
you will no longer be tainted

156
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
by bad memories from the outside world.

157
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,600
Yeehub.

158
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
What are you worried about?

159
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,200
When will Som Po return home?

160
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,080
She’ll return when the time is right.

161
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Why worry about it?

162
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,200
It’s sinful

163
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,600
It's good.

164
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,360
- I don't eat meat.
- Whoa.

165
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,200
Som Po.

166
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,440
I've been looking for you. Come with me.

167
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,880
Som Po.

168
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,640
Kahla.

169
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,560
Where is she going?

170
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
The urine changed color.

171
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,920
You've succeeded Kahla.

172
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
Oh, no.

173
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,520
Neither of us is pregnant yet.

174
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,000
We were just playing loudly. We apologize.

175
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,560
If Som Po and I get pregnant,
we'll let you know.

176
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,520
- Alright.
- Alright.

177
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,160
Alright.

178
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,240
Kahla, you lied. It's a sin.

179
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,960
If she knows,
I have to go back to Laplae right away.

180
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,280
I'd rather face Goddess Som’s anger

181
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,960
than return to the city without you.

182
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,720
Som Po,
you need to hurry and get pregnant.

183
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,600
I'll try harder.

184
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,600
Or you haven't copulated yet?

185
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,560
Som Po,

186
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,480
you know that if we don’t
return to the town within two months,

187
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,360
we could face great danger.

188
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,000
Now that the ladies have drunk
the purifying antidote,

189
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
how are they?

190
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,240
Rampoei and Songpeep have woken up,

191
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
but Chaba and Somsook
are still unconscious.

192
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,920
However, the vital signs
of the pregnancies are still good,

193
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,280
and all the babies in the womb are safe.

194
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,680
Seeing you take such good care of
the pregnant women puts my mind at ease.

195
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,960
However, I can’t help but wonder

196
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,680
if you might prefer another woman

197
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,560
to become the next Queen
instead of Som Po.

198
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,800
But since Som Po
has yet to return to the town,

199
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,400
who do you think should be the next Queen?

200
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,160
The lineage of your family

201
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,360
has ruled Laplae for a long time.

202
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,720
No other family should take over as Queen.

203
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,720
Aren't you afraid

204
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,280
that another woman
might give birth to a daughter

205
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,720
who could take the position
of Queen from Som Po?

206
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,880
My Queen.

207
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,680
I'm a healer. My duty is to save lives.

208
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
Fan it carefully
so the fire doesn’t go out,

209
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,480
and make sure
the water in the pot doesn’t boil over.

210
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,040
Did we really go devil-hunting?

211
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,760
I felt like I had a dream

212
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,560
of seeing a devil, but it's so blurry.

213
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,200
I only remember
going out of the Misty Gate,

214
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,680
and then I just woke up here.

215
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,240
Then, how did I get pregnant Lady Healer?

216
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,200
The past doesn’t matter now.

217
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,160
The most important thing
you need to focus on

218
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,120
is the child in your womb.

219
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,040
My stomach is this beautiful.
My child must be a girl.

220
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,240
The elders say if the navel
is facing down, you’ll have a daughter.

221
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,840
- Really?
- Yes.

222
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,600
- Is mine facing down?
- Yes.

223
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,760
How is my child, Lady Healer?

224
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,160
Your pulse is very weak.
Have you not been sleeping?

225
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,440
Then what should I do?

226
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,600
You need to take medicine.

227
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,720
Goya, bring me the medicine pot.

228
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,160
You all need to take this medicine.

229
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,320
It will make you fall asleep early,

230
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,360
and your child will grow fast.

231
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,920
Yes Lady Healer.

232
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,840
Here you go.
Drink it so you'll be healthy.

233
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,840
There's a safflower petal.

234
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,880
The elders say pregnant women
shouldn’t eat safflower petals.

235
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,560
Goya! How could you mistake

236
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,480
marigold petals for safflower petals?

237
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
You deserve to be just a laborer.

238
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,080
I'm a healer.

239
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,120
How could I possibly give
safflower petals to pregnant women?

240
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,720
I apologize. I was worried.

241
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Unnecessary know-it-all.

242
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,520
Chaba, drink it.

243
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,360
Everyone, drink it.
Your child will grow fast.

244
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,880
Yes Lady Healer.

245
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,720
Everyone, go soak in the hot spring.

246
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,320
It will help your body

247
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,520
and the baby

248
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,000
have better blood circulation.

249
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,440
Everyone.

250
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,680
Isn't the water too hot?

251
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,880
I think it's alright.

252
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
I think so too.

253
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,840
Rub the water on your belly too,
so your skin stays healthy.

254
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,040
Blood! Whose blood is it?

255
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,200
It's not my blood.

256
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,400
- It's not mine either.
- Blood.

257
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,560
The blood comes from you.

258
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,560
Lady Healer.

259
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,080
- What's happening?
- Blood.

260
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
- You.
- No!

261
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,920
- Songpeep.
- No.

262
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,120
- Help me.
- Help me.

263
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,000
My Queen.

264
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,840
I'm a healer. My duty is to save lives.

265
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,920
Why are you talking

266
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,400
as if you’re completely innocent?

267
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,960
Isn’t it because of me

268
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,320
that no one knows about your sin?

269
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,440
Help me.

270
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,720
- Songpeep.
- Help!

271
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
You’re strange.

272
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,360
Why are you showing me your pee?

273
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,600
Aw, what a dumb devil.

274
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,520
You don't even know that
it means I'm pregnant.

275
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,520
How can I know it from looking…

276
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Huh? Did you say you're pregnant?

277
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,120
Aren't you happy?

278
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm pregnant. You'll get the gold.

279
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,400
I'm happy, but…

280
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,120
Am I going to be a father?

281
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,800
Then what should I do Kahla?

282
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
You don't need to do anything, just…

283
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,640
take this gold.

284
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,160
Kahla, give it to me.

285
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
Do you want more than a stick of gold?

286
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Yes I do.

287
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,600
The more, the better.

288
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,640
If you want more gold,

289
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,240
you need to help me.

290
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,840
What do you want me to help with?

291
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,440
Help me make Som Po pregnant?

292
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
Som Po?

293
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,360
- Your friend?
- Yes.

294
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,840
It's you. Where did you go earlier?

295
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,000
You come and go. It's strange.

296
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,480
I've told you that we can't have sex.

297
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,760
Before getting married.

298
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,800
But we can hold a wedding ceremony.

299
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,320
Come on. I can't wait any longer.

300
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,840
Som Po.

301
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,240
I understand that you
will do everything to get pregnant.

302
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,120
But if that’s the case,

303
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,640
can you promise me that
if you get pregnant,

304
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
we won’t be separated?

305
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,120
I don’t want another child like me.

306
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,440
I don't understand.

307
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,000
Just know that…

308
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,480
what’s between us is impossible.

309
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,000
If that's the case, tonight

310
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,000
will be the last time you see me.

311
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,800
Didn't you make it?

312
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,160
Som Po.

313
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,560
I won’t let you do as you please anymore.

314
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,680
Help her.

315
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,200
Kahla, aren't you jealous of me at all?

316
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Do what I said.

317
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,040
Otherwise, you won't get what you want.

318
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,040
Come on.

319
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,200
Som Po, you promised me.

320
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
Copulate with Devil Min.

321
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm sorry,

322
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,800
but we both have duties to fulfill.

323
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Lady Guardian has arrived.

324
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,320
I bow to you my Queen.

325
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,600
Som Po was a sickly child,

326
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,480
always crying.

327
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,440
Your Khemkao probably didn't
cause you as much worry as Som Po did.

328
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,120
Khemkao is clumsy and careless,

329
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,640
often getting hurt easily.

330
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,680
Plus, she's stubborn and mischievous.

331
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,520
I get worn out with my child too.

332
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,480
Even if they’re not what you hoped for,

333
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,360
your child is still your child.

334
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,040
The mother--daughter bond

335
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,760
can never be broken.

336
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,360
You must be worried about Som Po.

337
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
Lady Guardian Eungpueng,

338
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,440
have you managed
the forces overseeing the Misty Edge?

339
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,000
I’ve positioned the forces well.

340
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,720
No wild beasts will be able
to slip into our Laplae.

341
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,840
Even if you’re not there,

342
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,560
will the forces still be well managed?

343
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
What do you mean?

344
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,480
Even if I'm not there?

345
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,560
Can you go out and find Som Po for me?

346
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,199
I can't do that.

347
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,320
Goddess Som will punish me.

348
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,400
Going out of town like that…

349
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,239
I can't do it my Queen.

350
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,360
That's right.

351
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,280
How can you not follow the rules?

352
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,160
Just forget what I said.

353
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,360
I must be losing my mind from worry.

354
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,440
Please don't mind me.

355
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,360
Alright.

356
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Mother.

357
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,600
Khemkao, what did I tell you?

358
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,760
You told me not to run.

359
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,960
That's right, especially
when I have sharp things in my hands.

360
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,680
Don't run to me. Do you remember that?

361
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
I do.

362
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,840
Come here.

363
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,760
My good girl.

364
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,800
Are you really the Lady Guardian now?

365
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,240
That's right.

366
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,600
From now on,
I have to go to the Misty Edge every day.

367
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,480
Some days, I won't come home.

368
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,600
You need to go to bed with her.
Don't wait for me.

369
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,040
Go eat something.

370
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,880
Eat a lot. I'll find you later.

371
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,840
Lady Healer, how are the babies
in the devil-hunters' wombs?

372
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,720
The two little ones
in the wombs are still strong.

373
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,080
If the babies that Chaba and Songpeep

374
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,800
miscarried had been girls,

375
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,280
it would have been
a great loss for Laplae.

376
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,480
Now, we only have two pregnant women left.

377
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,640
Som Po and Kahla haven’t returned yet.

378
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,000
Our hopes still rest on their pregnancies.

379
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,000
Regarding Som Po and Kahla,

380
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,960
it’s been two months now

381
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,760
yet neither of them has returned.

382
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,360
Could it be time for that law?

383
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,360
According to the rules for devil-hunting,

384
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,960
if the devil-hunters
don’t return within two months,

385
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,640
they will face the death penalty.

386
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,360
Since I was born,

387
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,600
I haven’t seen anyone
receive this punishment.

388
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,320
Queen Bua,

389
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,160
even the devil-hunters themselves
have never known of this law.

390
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,360
Now, two of our devil-hunters
have already miscarried,

391
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,680
leaving only two babies.

392
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,080
My Queen,

393
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,680
please consider sparing Som Po
and Kahla from this law.

394
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,080
The law is the law.

395
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,880
How could I possibly make
an exception for my own daughter?

396
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,720
If there’s nothing else,

397
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,440
I ask that everyone return to their duties

398
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,160
for the sake of Laplae and Goddess Som.

399
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,640
My Queen.

400
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Khemkao, I'm back. Are you asleep?

401
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,560
Lady Guardian.

402
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,120
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

403
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,480
For what? What happened?

404
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Khemkao.

405
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,320
- Lady Guardian.
- Khemkao.

406
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,520
- What are you doing here?
- Where's my child?

407
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,560
Where is my daughter?

408
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,680
No, I can't let you in.

409
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,360
- You can't go in.
- Khemkao.

410
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,800
- Khemkao.
- You can't go in.

411
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Lady Guardian.

412
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,160
Khemkao is asleep, so keep quiet.

413
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
My Queen.

414
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,080
Why did you bring Khemkao here?

415
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,080
Eungpueng, you have many duties.

416
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,240
Entrust your child
to the care of the Queen.

417
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,560
Pudson, Yeehub…

418
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,240
Eungpueng,

419
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,440
as you know,

420
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,680
if the devil-hunters
don’t return within two months,

421
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,960
they will face the death penalty.

422
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,360
My Queen.

423
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,440
My Queen.

424
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,800
I beg you, Eungpueng.

425
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,200
Please bring Som Po back to Laplae.

426
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,400
Protect my child

427
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,000
as I am protecting Khemkao right now.

428
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,960
Get out of my way.

429
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,120
Why are you leaving Laplae,
Lady Guardian Eungpueng?

430
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,560
You don't need to know.

431
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,640
Just bring Som Po back to you, right?

432
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,040
And protect her

433
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,000
from the executioners outside.

434
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,000
Close your eyes.

435
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,400
Close your eyes.

436
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,120
NEXT EPISODE

437
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,040
Now I know why you wanted a gun.

438
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,280
Sixty days,
the execution deadline has arrived.

439
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
