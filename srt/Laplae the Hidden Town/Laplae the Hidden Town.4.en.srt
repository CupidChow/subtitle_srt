1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>Som Po,</i>

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,800
<i>the last devil-hunter of the year.</i>

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,920
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,640
This golden turmeric

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,680
is the key
that will bring you back to Laplae.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,080
I smell something bad.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,560
Where is it?

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,320
Better price than I thought.

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,360
Soi.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,880
Soi.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Ah.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Drink some water.

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
I just moved here recently.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,920
I don’t really know who I am.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,720
Grandma found me
unconscious in the forest.

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,080
She took pity on me and brought me here.

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,560
She raised me as if I were her own child.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,360
She named me Soi.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,240
- Soi?
- Yes.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,480
She said when she found me,

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,560
I only had this necklace with me,

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,520
so she named me Soi.

23
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,320
<i>I made this</i>

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,480
to celebrate
that we were selected as devil-hunters.

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,600
This stone

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
looks like mother's stone.

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,640
Yes, it's hers

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
but I broke it into two pieces

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,440
so that it feels like
she is still with us.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,600
Thank you Anchan.

31
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,400
Goddess Som has shown
great kindness to me,

32
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
making you my twin sister.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,080
I hope we get twin daughters
from devil-hunting.

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,680
Have you seen a necklace like this before?

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,840
Do you not remember anything?

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,600
I don't remember anything.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
What…

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
What are we to each other?

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,720
It must be a coincidence
that we look alike.

40
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,520
I have to go now

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
but I will come back to find you again.

42
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm so tired.

43
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,960
The two of us have to burn charcoal for
the whole town. When will it be finished?

44
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,960
Goddess Som has decreed
that we become laborers.

45
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,160
Whatever she commands, we must do.

46
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,600
I have great faith in Goddess Som,

47
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
but I don’t understand.

48
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,360
Someone like me or you
did not pass the devil-hunter selection,

49
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,160
but Som Po did.

50
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,920
She passed.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,840
You shouldn’t talk about this.

52
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,960
If someone hears it,

53
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,600
they might think
we’re accusing Som Po of cheating.

54
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,360
Som Po might be cheating.
Don’t forget who her mother is.

55
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,720
A woman who can’t accomplish anything
but still passes the selection

56
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,960
must have cheated.

57
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,880
I think she must have cheated Fuangfah.

58
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
Lady Warden.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Where did you hear it? What cheat?

60
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Goddess Som chose her.

61
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
It's disrespectful.

62
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,560
The goddess may come to take their lives.

63
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,360
That's what I'm worried about.

64
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
Where is this rumor from?

65
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,760
I’m afraid that

66
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,000
this rumor might cause
something serious to happen.

67
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,880
Is there anything to be concerned about?

68
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,600
Everything is normal,

69
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,440
but…

70
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,960
But what?

71
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,480
But I still haven’t seen
Lady Guardian Angkab return yet.

72
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,840
Does she have any work
that might delay her return?

73
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,240
It must be an important task.

74
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,400
You should focus on your work.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,840
- Alright.
- Alright.

76
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,680
I have to work until the sun sets.

77
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120
This is my fate.

78
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,960
I have no chance
to live comfortably like other women.

79
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,240
They say Goddess Som protects everyone,

80
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,800
so why was I cast away from the loom
and left to dig in the dirt?

81
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,480
Watch your mouth.

82
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,120
Hey.

83
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
Both of you, follow me.

84
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
- Alright.
- Alright.

85
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,320
‪No!

86
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,720
Eungpueng.

87
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,000
Eungpueng.

88
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,400
Eungpueng.

89
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
Mother.

90
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,600
‪No.

91
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
No.

92
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,920
Mother.

93
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
Mother.

94
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,680
Who is that?

95
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,600
Queen Bua.

96
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,440
‪Mother.

97
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,480
‪Mother.

98
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

99
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

100
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,040
Mother, what's happening?

101
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
Mother.

102
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,880
I’ve treated the wound and given medicine,

103
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,520
but the fever still hasn’t gone down.

104
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,960
We’ll have to look after her all night.

105
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,960
The claws of the Mist Demon
are so dangerous.

106
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,440
Lady Healer,

107
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,760
please ensure that Eungpueng stays safe.

108
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,680
I will pray to Goddess Som

109
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,480
to protect Eungpueng as well.

110
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,240
But I wonder

111
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
why the Mist Demon
is coming here to harm people.

112
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
<i>A woman who can’t accomplish anything</i>
<i>but still passes the selection</i>

113
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
must have cheated.

114
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
I think she must have cheated.

115
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,520
<i>Who said that?</i>

116
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,200
Have them punished.

117
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,640
Everyone wants to be a devil-hunter,

118
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,160
and if anyone has doubts,

119
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
it’s not surprising.

120
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,280
But they speak falsely.

121
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
Lady Healer Boonnak,

122
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,760
I deeply appreciate the kindness

123
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,040
you have shown to me and Som Po,

124
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,320
but let everything

125
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,880
be decided by Goddess Som.

126
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,040
And if any resident of Laplae

127
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,120
is displeased
that Som Po became a devil-hunter,

128
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,200
there’s nothing I can do about it.

129
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,440
Or perhaps Goddess Som

130
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,280
sent it down to punish
the people of Laplae.

131
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,000
Or has someone broken the rules of Laplae,

132
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,880
and Goddess Som is punishing us?

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,240
Pudson,

134
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
inspect the entire town.

135
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,680
See if anyone
has violated the rules of Laplae.

136
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Yes my Queen.

137
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,120
Goddess Som.

138
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,880
You have broken the rules

139
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,520
by mistreating the laborer
in your household.

140
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,440
Imprison her.

141
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,640
- You misunderstand.
- Go.

142
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,240
- Lady Warden, please don't imprison me.
- Go.

143
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
I've made a mistake.

144
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,640
What did she do wrong?

145
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
She used spoiled ingredients to cook.

146
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,280
Imprison her.

147
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,280
There are only minor offenses.

148
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,440
Any report of the Mist Demon
from the misty edge?

149
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,480
The Guardian unit
hasn’t sent any reports yet.

150
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,880
Today, I will spend the entire day praying

151
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,200
and asking for forgiveness
from Goddess Som.

152
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,800
You may prepare the offerings
and then return home.

153
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,840
Yes my Queen.

154
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,960
My Queen.

155
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,840
Queen Bua.

156
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,600
Lady Warden Pudson.

157
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,200
Is there any update?

158
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,520
After my patrol,

159
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,680
I found some
who broke the rules of Laplae.

160
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,800
I knew it.

161
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,560
but these were only minor offenses.

162
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
They are not severe enough for Goddess Som

163
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,080
to send the Mist Demon as punishment.

164
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,400
What could have led Goddess Som
to punish Laplae so severely?

165
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,960
Well…

166
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,480
I have a concern.

167
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,080
Well…

168
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,040
I’ve checked Lady Guardian Angkab’s house.

169
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Is Lady Guardian here?

170
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,920
She is not.

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,720
I haven't seen her
since she sent the devil-hunters off.

172
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,600
I sent the Warden unit

173
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,720
to inspect every side of the misty edge,

174
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,160
but they found no trace
of Lady Guardian Angkab.

175
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,440
Could it be that
the Guardian is not in Laplae?

176
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,920
I hope it's my misunderstanding

177
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,320
because leaving Laplae

178
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,160
without permission is a grave offense.

179
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
And it might be the reason

180
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,760
- why Goddess Som-
- Wait.

181
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,800
Do not rush to judgment.

182
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,120
Let's wait until
we find Angkab and question her.

183
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,440
It might be better.

184
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,880
Yes my Queen.

185
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,800
What are you looking for?

186
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,000
My turmeric.

187
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,120
Turmeric?

188
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,960
Do you know how it was lost?

189
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,520
I have no idea.

190
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,720
I can't remember.

191
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,720
Oh, Som Po.

192
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,960
Why are you only searching the house?

193
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
Could it not have fallen somewhere else?

194
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,680
If we go look for it now,
we might find it.

195
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,840
<i>I’ll search at the market,</i>

196
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,120
<i>you go look around the forest.</i>

197
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
Don't go too hard,

198
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,160
or you won’t have the energy
to carry things tomorrow.

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,880
He's got it.

200
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,080
He's always like this when he's drunk.

201
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,480
Cheers.

202
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,560
Actually, that woman was hitting on you.

203
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,880
‪What?

204
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm taking a walk.

205
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
What are you doing?

206
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,000
What…

207
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,920
Well, I…

208
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,000
<i>I have to do it.</i>

209
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,800
<i>Goddess Som sent this devil in my dream,</i>

210
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,920
<i>and now he stands before me.</i>

211
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,160
<i>I must seduce him.</i>

212
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,480
Are you…

213
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,160
Ah, are you alright?

214
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,640
Devil.

215
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,400
Hey. Let go of me.

216
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,320
Let go of me.

217
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,360
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,920
Are you alright? I'm sorry.

219
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,200
Stop. Don't come close.

220
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
If I don't get closer,

221
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,560
how are we supposed to copulate?

222
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
Copulate?

223
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,840
You and I?

224
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,000
Goddess Som has brought me to you.

225
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,680
Now, come and help me make a daughter.

226
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,200
Stop. Stop now.

227
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,880
What kind of woman jumps on a man

228
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,480
the first time they meet?

229
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,120
Turn your life around
and respect yourself.

230
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,560
It may not be too hard
to find a good husband.

231
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
You are strange.

232
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,160
There are no good devils.

233
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,840
But you may be better than anyone else.

234
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
That's why Goddess Som
sent you in my dream.

235
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,840
- Come and copulate with me.
- No.

236
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,200
We just met. I don't even know your name.

237
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
My name is Som Po.

238
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,800
Goddess Som gave you to me.

239
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,560
Som Po?

240
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,360
Goddess Som told me

241
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,880
to tell you to wait for me here.

242
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,240
Did she tell you so?

243
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,320
Goddess Som told me

244
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,960
to tell you to wait for me…

245
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,640
there.

246
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
Wait for me there.

247
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,840
I'll be waiting for you here.

248
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,280
Wait here, alright?

249
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,000
Wait.

250
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
What is your name?

251
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,000
Chan. I'm Chan.

252
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,160
Som Po.

253
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,920
Som Po.

254
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,560
Som Po.

255
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,920
Why is a beautiful lady

256
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,640
walking alone in the forest?
Aren't you afraid?

257
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,680
Do you want Min to walk with you?

258
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,280
Is your name Min?

259
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,960
Yes.

260
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,680
What is your name?

261
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,480
You look strong

262
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,840
and vigorous,

263
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,720
with a broad chest,

264
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,400
firm buttocks,

265
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,920
and not short.

266
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,080
You have the qualities
that make you suitable to be a sire.

267
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,040
If you are destined to be one,

268
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,480
we may meet again.

269
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,720
Som Po.

270
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,120
Som Po.

271
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,800
Som Po.

272
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,960
Som Po.

273
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,640
Som Po.

274
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,320
Som Po.

275
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,320
Som Po.

276
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,440
Som Po.

277
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,240
It's you Kahla.

278
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,960
Why are you sitting here?

279
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,320
I've been looking for
your golden turmeric.

280
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,040
But you were sleeping here.

281
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
But…

283
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
- Kahla.
- Hm?

284
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,760
I found the devil that I dreamed of.

285
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,040
His name is Chan.

286
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,360
He is not scary at all.

287
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,680
He deserves to be the one
Goddess Som gave to me.

288
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,600
Did you

289
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,120
copulate with the devil?

290
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,160
Not yet.

291
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,560
He told me to wait here.

292
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,320
Whoa, Som Po.

293
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,280
You waited until you fell asleep.

294
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,320
That devil has deceived you.
He won't be coming back.

295
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
Huh?

296
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,880
I used all my wiles,

297
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
but it didn’t work did it?

298
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,920
Let’s put the devil aside for now.

299
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,120
What we need to worry about
is the turmeric.

300
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,400
If you can't find the turmeric,
what will you do?

301
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,800
I lost my turmeric
and my devil deceived me.

302
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,960
Am I stuck in this devil town?

303
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
No.

304
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,040
I'll bring you back with me.

305
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,680
My turmeric is still here.

306
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,640
Don't you worry.

307
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,760
We'll get to go home together.

308
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,000
Thank you Kahla.

309
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,320
All these women have gold with them?

310
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,320
That's good.

311
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,240
Bring a lot of them.

312
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,960
- Here.
- Alright.

313
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,160
Alright.

314
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,000
Somsook, where are you going?

315
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm moving in with the devil.

316
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,520
- Move in with the devil?
- Yes.

317
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,760
I don't want to copulate
with many different devils.

318
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,920
This devil doesn't smell bad.
I can bear with him.

319
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,800
I'll move in with the devil too.

320
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,160
So we can copulate all day and night

321
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
and I'll get pregnant soon.

322
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,800
And…

323
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,160
what is that?

324
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,680
The numbers of devils that Chaba hunted.

325
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,320
Oh.

326
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,320
That many?

327
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,880
If you think Chaba has a lot,
look at Rampoei's.

328
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,760
Huh?

329
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,480
Rampoei,

330
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,000
did you take a rest and eat?

331
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,960
I don't want to eat. It's a waste of time.

332
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,400
Are you pregnant yet?

333
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
I've prepared my urine.

334
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,320
I will put the test powder
into the urine as the teacher instructed.

335
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
She said

336
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,240
if we put the powder

337
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,680
into the urine and its color changes,

338
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,560
it means I'm pregnant.

339
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm not pregnant yet.

340
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,080
Tomorrow, I'll hunt more devils

341
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,920
so I'll get pregnant.

342
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,880
You need to rest and eat too Rampoei.

343
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,120
I can't wait to go back.

344
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,920
I have enough knowledge
to teach the children in Laplae.

345
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,840
How would you remember anything?

346
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,640
When you go back,

347
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,880
you will need to take the purity antidote.

348
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,280
How many have you hunted?

349
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,560
That look says none.

350
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,560
If two months pass,

351
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,400
be prepared to be
a laborer when you return.

352
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,560
What's wrong?

353
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,400
Wait Kahla.

354
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,880
- Who are you angry with?
- Som Po,

355
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,760
Rampoei insulted you so much.
How can you accept that?

356
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,000
What do you want me to do?

357
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
You can use the same devil as me.

358
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,280
I found a potential devil

359
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,880
but I didn't hunt him
because I was looking for you.

360
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,520
I think we'll get
a daughter from this devil.

361
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,960
But…

362
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,600
Goddess Som chose the devil Chan for me.

363
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,760
I want to use the devil
Goddess Som gave me.

364
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,280
Then let's separate.

365
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,600
But if you can't make it,

366
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,800
just forget the devil Chan

367
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,120
and use another devil. Promise?

368
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,840
I promise.

369
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
- Hunt the devils.
- Hunt the devils.

370
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,400
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

371
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,000
- We'll go for it.
- We'll go for it.

372
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,160
- For daughters and Laplae.
- For daughters and Laplae.

373
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,760
Alright. Let's go.

374
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,600
‪Hey.

375
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,800
‪Hey.

376
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,920
Jai, we're on the same side.

377
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,240
If we are, why didn't you send any news?

378
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,720
I was going to tell you

379
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,400
that the Siamese troops are on the move.

380
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,920
I just couldn’t find you guys.

381
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,240
If you still care about your comrades,

382
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,000
help me burn down
the Siamese camp outside the town

383
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,720
to prevent them from reaching Phrae.

384
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,640
Aren't you just here
to gather information?

385
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,760
Don't act on your own.

386
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,960
If you’re caught, who would send the news?

387
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,880
So what will you do?

388
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,960
What will you do?

389
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Let them kill our people?

390
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,040
I think Min sides with the Siamese.

391
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm still a Ngiao person.

392
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,360
I'm really trying to help us.

393
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Then prove it.

394
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,760
Help me burn the Siamese camp.

395
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,120
<i>- Ten.</i>
<i>- Fifteen.</i>

396
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,640
If you want 15, go somewhere else.
It's not easy to find guns.

397
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,600
It's not easy
to find this kind of gold either.

398
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,840
Thirteen.

399
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,640
Prepare 50 guns for me.

400
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,920
Mother, Eungpueng has woken up.

401
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,160
Thank you.

402
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,720
Thank you

403
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,080
for saving me from the Mist Demon.

404
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,720
It is my duty.

405
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,480
Don't worry.

406
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Eungpueng works really hard,

407
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,760
worthy of being a guardian,

408
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,080
more than Guardian Angkab.

409
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,920
Dokfai.

410
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,600
They are saying all over town

411
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
that Lady Guardian Angkab

412
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,400
left the town without permission.

413
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,240
That's why Goddess Som sent the Mist Demon
to punish the people of Laplae.

414
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,080
Where did you get this from?

415
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,640
Lady Guardian Angkab

416
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,480
would never do anything wrong or improper.

417
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,640
Dokfai,

418
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,400
stop telling her unpleasant matters.

419
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,480
Go get some food for her.

420
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,320
Go.

421
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Alright.

422
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,040
How is it here?

423
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,360
Everything is fine.
Nothing to be concerned about.

424
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,000
Then,

425
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,560
I'll transfer you to a support unit
at the place the Mist Demon appeared.

426
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,320
I’ll handle things here myself.

427
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Alright.

428
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,320
Go.

429
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,960
Follow me.

430
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,800
Anchan,

431
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,800
what happened to you?

432
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,360
I have to find the answer.

433
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,480
Lady Guardian Angkab.

434
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,880
You can't go now.

435
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,040
Right now, you are a criminal
for fleeing the town,

436
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,560
which angered Mother Goddess
and sent the Mist Demon to harm people.

437
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,440
Why are you doing this?

438
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,120
Eungpueng, please trust me.

439
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,480
Angkab, are you ready?

440
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,920
Push.

441
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,840
Push more.

442
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,240
Boonnak,

443
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,960
help her push. Take a deep breath.

444
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,160
One, two, three.

445
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,560
It's coming out.

446
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,360
Angkab, you have a daughter.

447
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,680
- A daughter.
- A daughter.

448
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,080
Bua, Anchan,

449
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,360
your bellies are getting bigger every day,

450
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,840
and it looks like
you’ll give birth at the same time.

451
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,720
I hope you get daughters.

452
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,520
Thank you.

453
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,800
I…

454
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,200
Bua.

455
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,560
Lady Healer, come take a look.

456
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,000
Bua.

457
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,560
Anchan.

458
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Anchan,

459
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,320
are you dead or alive?

460
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,760
Anchan.

461
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,000
Anchan.

462
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,600
Anchan.

463
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,760
Angkab, you can't go in.

464
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,040
Please tell me.

465
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,040
Please tell me

466
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,040
if that's Anchan, my sister.

467
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,600
She was healthy this morning

468
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,480
and prepared to give birth with Bua.

469
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,280
<i>How could she die?</i>

470
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
<i>Angkab,</i>

471
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,240
<i>Anchan lost a lot of blood</i>

472
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,640
<i>and died during childbirth.</i>

473
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,800
<i>You have to accept it.</i>

474
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,760
Let me see her face for the last time.

475
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,040
Angkab,

476
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,640
you're a mother now.

477
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Don’t take the baby near the grave.

478
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,000
It’s bad luck for a child
to be near the dead.

479
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,960
I've prayed to Goddess Som

480
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,120
to take Anchan to heaven.

481
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,040
Say goodbye to Anchan here.

482
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,200
Get your bags. We're leaving now.

483
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
<i>I sent someone to gather news</i>
<i>at the market,</i>

484
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,760
but all they found was Chan,
your son, Sir.

485
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,880
With the foreigners?

486
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,880
<i>Ngiao people in Chiang Mai, Lampang</i>

487
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,840
<i>and Phayao also have plans</i>
<i>for an uprising, just like in Phrae.</i>

488
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,360
I will lead the troops
to crush them completely.

489
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,760
NEXT EPISODE

490
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,160
You went outside.

491
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,680
You broke the rules
and angered Goddess Som.

492
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,080
Catch her.
