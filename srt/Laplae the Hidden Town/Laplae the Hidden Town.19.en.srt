PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,640
A mother must protect her child.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,400
Queen Bua has been deceiving us all!

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,600
Huh?!

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,680
- Your child was a devil.
- Huh?!

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,280
You can't be the Queen.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,240
Ungrateful!

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
One!

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,360
Two!

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,480
From now on,
no matter how much you play the flute,

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,400
the demons will never come out again.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,560
I’ll be waiting to see

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,920
how long you can keep Laplae standing.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,720
Now, Laplae has finally been freed

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
from the reign of the tyranny.

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,640
The auspicious time has come for us

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,720
to appoint a new Queen to lead our town.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,680
Queen Angkab, untainted and pure,

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,560
stands as a symbol
of prosperity and good fortune for us all.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,680
I bow to you, Queen Angkab.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,440
- I bow to you, Queen Angkab.
- I bow to you, Queen Angkab.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,480
My first and most urgent duty as Queen

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,440
is to restore order
and normalcy in the town,

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,720
as many positions
on the High Council remain vacant.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,920
Therefore, I appoint
Eungpueng as Lady Guardian,

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,160
Kahla as Lady Warden,

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,360
Som Po as Lady Healer,

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,200
and Goya, you shall serve
as a member of the Town Council.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
Well.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,320
But what about Bua and her followers?
How will you punish them?

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,880
We will judge them together,
and the decision

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,480
will rest with the Council.

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,560
What is certain, is that from now on,
everything will change.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
The era of deception has come to an end.

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,240
The liar no longer holds power.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,800
- I bow to you, Queen Angkab.
- I bow to you, Queen Angkab.

40
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,080
Som Po.

41
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,520
Queen Bua raised me.

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,560
You've grown into a beautiful woman.

43
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
If Goddess Som truly exists,

44
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,040
please grant me the chance
to be born as your child again

45
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
and never let anyone separate us.

46
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,880
I wanted to come and pay
my respects to your mother too.

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,640
Did you know my mother well?

48
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
Not very well,

49
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,040
but from what I saw,

50
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,680
she was kind,

51
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,440
just like you.

52
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,080
It's a pity

53
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,280
I had so little time with my real mother.

54
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
I never imagined

55
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,680
the mother who raised me all these years…

56
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,280
Could be a bad person, right?

57
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
I’m ashamed,

58
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,280
and I want to apologize to you, Som Po,

59
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,480
for the terrible things
my mother did to you.

60
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
I always dreamed

61
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,480
of meeting my real mother,

62
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,640
but when I finally did,

63
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,880
it turned out like this.

64
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
No matter what,

65
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,760
your mother is still alive.

66
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,640
You probably hate me now.

67
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,880
You did what you thought you had to do.

68
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,680
There’s no right or wrong in it.

69
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,160
We all do what we believe is necessary,

70
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
and then we face

71
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,800
the consequences.

72
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
That’s all.

73
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,600
If I had just been
an ordinary village boy,

74
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
and you

75
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,400
weren’t a woman of Laplae,

76
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,760
what would our lives have been like?

77
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,480
Back then,

78
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,280
I really loved you.

79
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,520
How about you?

80
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,799
Did you ever love me?

81
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,360
- Father.
- Yes.

82
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,800
- Oh, Chan. How are you?
- How are you, Father?

83
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,320
Just hang in there a little longer.
You’ll be able to get out soon.

84
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Chan and I

85
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,760
have some questions for you, Mother.

86
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,480
Why wasn’t I sent away
like the other boys,

87
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,640
but instead allowed to grow up
with Father in town?

88
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,760
<i>I may not have been the best mother,</i>

89
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,440
<i>but I tried.</i>

90
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,400
<i>Under the rules and traditions,</i>

91
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,560
I couldn’t be close to you,

92
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,280
so that

93
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,800
you could grow up somewhere better.

94
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,200
Do you understand me?

95
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,120
As for you Som Po,

96
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,960
even if you weren’t my own,

97
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
my feelings for you

98
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,600
were nothing but love.

99
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
Chan, Som Po.

100
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,120
Now I have no one left

101
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
but the two of you.

102
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,560
I don't want to die here.

103
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,200
Please, help me escape.

104
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
Don't say you love me.

105
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,880
You took me from Mother Anchan,

106
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,360
and raised me

107
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,280
just to make yourself Queen.

108
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,480
You only used me as a tool.

109
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,880
I had no choice at the time.

110
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,680
It was Lady Bongkod
who controlled everything.

111
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,200
I never wanted this.

112
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
Som Po,

113
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,160
you wouldn’t just stand by

114
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,920
and let your other mother die, would you?

115
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
How can you say that…

116
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,840
when you’re…

117
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,720
the one who killed her real mother
with your own hands?

118
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,320
- You have no shame at all?
- Chan.

119
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,920
Chan.

120
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,320
What will happen to me?

121
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,400
Wait for the new Queen's decision.

122
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,720
When I take this medicine,
all my memories of you

123
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,840
will return.

124
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,400
Will those memories make me fall in love?

125
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,960
Yes.

126
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,640
Then why should I take it?

127
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,240
Teacher said love like that

128
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,520
only brings pain.

129
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,160
Teacher was right.

130
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,720
Because right now, I’m in so much pain

131
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,800
knowing you’ve forgotten us.

132
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,360
Whether you take it or not,

133
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,080
is your choice.

134
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,960
No matter how many times you forget me,

135
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,160
I’ll accept it,

136
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,200
as long as

137
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,880
I can keep loving you.

138
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,200
As I promised,

139
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,320
you may take as much
golden turmeric as you wish.

140
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,520
Are you going to kick me out of town?

141
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,560
Didn’t you come to this town for
the golden turmeric in the first place?

142
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,960
You need it to trade for weapons
to strengthen your fellow Ngiao forces.

143
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,760
Don’t linger, or it will be too late.

144
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
In that case,

145
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,600
wait for me.

146
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,520
When I’ve finished my business outside,
I’ll return.

147
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,319
Why would you come back?

148
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,160
I was an orphan.

149
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,720
I never knew my parents,

150
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,319
but all I wish is to see
my own child’s face, just once,

151
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,800
so I can understand
what it feels like to have a family.

152
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,000
Please.

153
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,000
I overheard you talking to your mother,
saying that if the rebels win,

154
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,240
you’ll change the rules
to let men stay in the town.

155
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Yes.

156
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,360
That’s something that must change.

157
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,600
Som Po.

158
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,000
How are you? Has the medicine worked?

159
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,560
Do you remember me now?

160
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,640
Chan.

161
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,240
Som Po.

162
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,120
Once my father is released,

163
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,000
we’ll leave this place. Come with me.

164
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,720
- Do you mean…
- Let’s start over together.

165
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,760
We can be a family,

166
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,320
me, you,

167
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,600
and our child.

168
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,840
The women of Laplae
know nothing of the outside world.

169
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,720
Once the town opens,
they’ll be easily deceived.

170
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,400
We’ll learn through experience,
and that will bring us wisdom.

171
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,800
Wouldn’t it be better to wait until
we are ready before opening the town?

172
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,120
If we keep waiting for the perfect moment,
it will never come.

173
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,640
Change must begin today.

174
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
I propose we hold a vote

175
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,360
on who supports opening the town.

176
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,880
Laplae has finally reached this moment.

177
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,320
I…

178
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
propose we abolish
the devil-hunting ceremony,

179
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,120
and allow any woman of Laplae
to marry or relocate

180
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,800
as she pleases.

181
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,600
Do you wish to leave with that devil?

182
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,040
Your real mother

183
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,840
was just killed,

184
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,200
and you still want to live with her kind?

185
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,000
Let each person bear
the consequences of their own actions.

186
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,880
Or shall we condemn
even the child she carries?

187
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,840
Whoever agrees that the women of Laplae

188
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,760
should be free to relocate,
raise your hand.

189
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,000
I think today’s discussion
has gone on long enough.

190
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,480
- Let’s adjourn for now.
- Wait.

191
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There’s one more urgent matter.

192
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,120
What should we do with Bua, her followers,

193
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,480
and the Siamese soldiers?

194
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,440
There’s no need to do anything.
Just keep them imprisoned.

195
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,560
Bua and her kind have killed so many.

196
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,680
If we don’t punish them as an example,
when will justice be served?

197
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,200
Do you want to wait
for Goddess Som to pass judgment?

198
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
What do you think, my Queen?

199
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,080
Their crimes are severe, especially Bua’s.

200
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,880
I propose we give them all
the purifying antidote

201
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,720
and exile them, never to return.

202
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,560
How is that any different
from what she did to my mother?

203
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,520
It’s far less than what she deserves.

204
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,680
Did I give the order to execute her?

205
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,000
No.

206
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,440
So how can you say it’s the same?

207
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Whoever supports
giving the purifying antidote,

208
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,000
raise your hand.

209
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,120
My Queen, have you called for me?

210
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,520
Goya, I believe we think alike.

211
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,560
Really?

212
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,920
Your aunt actually allowed you
to go outside with me?

213
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,840
I’ll head back to pack my things
at the house first. Wait for me here.

214
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,920
The Queen has ordered us
to capture Devil Min too.

215
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Where is he?
Let’s split up and search for him.

216
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,040
Understood.

217
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,000
Min!

218
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,760
You need to run away now!

219
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
From what?

220
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,480
We don't have time. They're coming here.

221
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,240
If you don't want to get arrested,
follow me.

222
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,520
Wait. How about my gold?

223
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,560
Save your life first. Hurry!

224
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,640
Even though the mist demons are gone,

225
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,120
there are still dangers
from wild animals. Be cautious.

226
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,720
I truly thank you
for everything you’ve done.

227
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,440
Now go.

228
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
Go on.

229
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,760
Let me hug you
and our child one last time.

230
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,840
Kahla, wait for me.

231
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,200
- Once I finish my--
- Don't ever come back.

232
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,640
The situation is uncertain right now.

233
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,480
You could be in danger. Go, hurry.

234
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,880
Go now.

235
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,160
Seize him!

236
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,320
Put down your weapon, Lady Warden.

237
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,080
Mother, what are you doing?
This is not what we agreed.

238
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,440
The change you desire,

239
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,320
the townspeople might not want it.

240
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,200
I think opening the town right now

241
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,080
is premature.

242
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,560
It should be delayed.

243
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,760
Have you lost your mind?

244
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,640
What must be done, must be done.

245
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,640
This is the duty of the Queen.

246
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,560
We will no longer allow
wicked people to plague this town.

247
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,480
They will be exiled
from this town starting today.

248
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,960
But before you are banished,
you must drink the purifying antidote

249
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,800
to forget everything about Laplae.

250
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,520
Som Po, my child.

251
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,680
No.

252
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,600
What are you doing?

253
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Chan!

254
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,040
Chan!

255
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,000
As for you two,
you must forget everything.

256
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,240
Every last memory.

257
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,320
You brat! Open your mouth!

258
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,920
May I ask for one last thing

259
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,200
before drinking the purifying antidote?

260
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,120
If I must leave Laplae,

261
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,360
I wish to leave with dignity.

262
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,880
At least allow the maidens

263
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,400
to comb my hair,

264
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,120
so I may leave looking proper.

265
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,760
This is your price to pay.

266
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,920
From this day forward,

267
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,080
the town of Laplae
will return to peace and order.

268
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,200
- I bow to you, my Queen.
- I bow to you, my Queen.

269
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,200
- I bow to you, my Queen.
- I bow to you, my Queen.

270
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,680
- I bow to you, my Queen.
- I bow to you, my Queen.

271
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,320
- I bow to you, my Queen.
- Get out!

272
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,000
- Get out!
- Get out!

273
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,520
- Get out!
- Get out!

274
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,199
- Don't come back!
- Get out!

275
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,480
Chan!

276
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,880
- Get out!
- Get out!

277
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,280
- Chan!
- Get out!

278
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,040
I think we’ve come far enough.
Let’s leave them here.

279
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,320
But as for Bua and Pudson,
they need to be taken further away.

280
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,679
The Queen doesn’t want them
waking up together.

281
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,840
Mr. Chan! Mr. Chan has woken up.

282
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Mr. Chan.

283
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,200
I was so worried about you.

284
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,480
Father.

285
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,320
This is not Phra Nakhon.
Where is this place?

286
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,240
I'm also confused.

287
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,240
Both you and Mr. Chan
disappeared into the forest for weeks.

288
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,480
You said you were
going to hunt down the Ngiao,

289
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,200
and Mr. Chan went searching for Som Po.

290
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,600
- Som Po?
- Yes Sir.

291
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Who is that?

292
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,720
What are you doing?
Are you stealing my fruits?

293
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,240
- It's mine!
- It's mine!

294
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,840
- It's mine!
- It's mine!

295
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,880
Hey!

296
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,520
What's that?

297
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,640
Is she crazy? She cut her throat.

298
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,360
Check on her.

299
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,000
She's dead.

300
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,360
Mother.

301
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,880
What did you do to Chan, Aunt Angkab?

302
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,720
He has nothing to do with all of this.

303
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,360
We just erased their memories
and exiled them from the town.

304
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,000
Memories?

305
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,880
From now on, the laws of the land

306
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,680
will be matters for the elders to handle.

307
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Nothing can change overnight.

308
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,560
So, I ask for your patience.

309
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,280
You're young.

310
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,960
Just continue learning

311
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,480
and doing your part
to the best of your ability.

312
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,000
Hold on. I don't mean any harm.

313
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,480
Here, take it.

314
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,960
You can eat it. Take it.

315
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,080
Take it.

316
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,600
Don't do that!

317
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,480
I’ve fed you,
now pay me back for it, won’t you?

318
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Stop!

319
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,040
Let go of me!

320
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,560
You wretch!

321
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,840
NEXT EPISODE

322
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,640
Min, how did you manage to get this much?

323
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,000
Hey!

324
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,240
Bua, it’s been almost twenty years,

325
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,000
<i>and now we finally meet again.</i>

326
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,040
You both were given
the memory-erasing potion.

327
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,920
<i>I want to help the townspeople,</i>
<i>so I’m asking for your help</i>

328
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,200
- Fire!
<i>- to fight against the wicked.</i>

329
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,600
<i>Bua has no memories left.</i>
<i>How did she come back?</i>

330
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,000
- Stop!
- Stop!

331
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,000
