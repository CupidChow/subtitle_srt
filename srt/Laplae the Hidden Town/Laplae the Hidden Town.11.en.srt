00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,160
How can I believe you?

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,280
Let me prove my loyalty.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,000
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,960
Get water to put out the fire!

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,320
Angkab.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,240
She’s a person just like us,
with a town where she grew up.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,280
Who is she?

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,920
She is from the Town of Mist.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,160
Soldiers! Capture this woman.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,240
- Capture her!
- Som Po.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,360
- I said let go of her. Father!
- Devil Chan!

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,600
Don’t think I’ll ever accept you.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,880
I don’t want my son
to face a terrible fate from

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
a barbarian woman in that Town of Mist.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,040
- I need to go and ask the Queen.
- You can't.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,239
What was that sound?

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,160
Chan.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,880
Devil Chan.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
Som Po.

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,040
How could you leave me?

24
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
Wait. It's me.

25
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,440
How did you get here?

26
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,880
Did you follow me?

27
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,840
You need to leave Laplae now.

28
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,280
Look at you.

29
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,400
Your husband comes all this way,
and instead of being happy,

30
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,000
you’re chasing me away?

31
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,040
You're a devil.

32
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
You can't come into this town.

33
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,480
Because there are only women?

34
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
When I was a child,

35
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,560
I heard about a mysterious town

36
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,600
full of women and gold.

37
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,520
Kahla, please take me to see the town.

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,760
- I really want to see it.
- Stop.

39
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,680
Just a glimpse, please Kahla.

40
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,400
Let go of me.

41
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
Kahla,

42
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,080
you stole that gun from me
and now you're going to shoot me too?

43
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,720
If anyone finds you, you won’t survive.

44
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
So if I shoot you now,
it won’t make a difference.

45
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,840
If you shoot me now,

46
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,760
the whole town will swarm over here.

47
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,360
And you’ll lose your chance
to find out about your mother.

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,880
Here. Wear this.

49
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
No one can know that you're a devil.

50
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,400
Where is everyone?

51
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,000
Hey.

52
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,720
What happened?

53
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
It's Kahla. She tied us up.

54
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,240
You’re the gatekeepers,

55
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,280
how could you let Kahla capture you?

56
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,440
Where are you going?

57
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm going to ask the Queen

58
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,120
why my mother was punished so severely.

59
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,360
How can you be sure that you'll be safe?

60
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm not afraid. I have a gun.

61
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,720
You don’t want anyone to know you’re back,

62
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
yet you’re going out in broad daylight?

63
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,360
Kahla,

64
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,840
I don’t know exactly what’s going on,

65
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,680
but if you’re planning something big,

66
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,440
acting rashly won’t help.

67
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,440
It will only bring danger.

68
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,600
Besides,

69
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,120
the child in your belly isn’t just yours,

70
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,880
right?

71
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
Right?

72
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,760
Let go of me.

73
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,320
Then hurry back.

74
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
I’m lonely.

75
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,800
Golden turmeric,

76
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
when it's in this town,

77
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,080
it just becomes ordinary turmeric?

78
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,400
Then they must have fields of it planted.

79
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Kahla.

80
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
Search this place.

81
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,280
Yes Lady.

82
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,240
No one is here Lady Warden.

83
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
She's definitely back.

84
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
Send guards to watch over this house

85
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,360
and find Kahla.

86
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,400
Yes Lady.

87
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Kahla.

88
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,160
Kahla.

89
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,040
- Kahla.
- Min?

90
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,240
Come here.

91
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,760
I told you not to leave the house.

92
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,960
We can't stay at your house anymore.

93
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,920
Go this way.

94
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,480
Whoa.

95
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
Is it safe here?

96
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,400
Right now, the laborers are
working in another field.

97
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,880
No one will follow us.

98
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,720
Then tell me what exactly is happening.

99
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,960
So I can help you out.

100
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,600
You should get out of Laplae.

101
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,960
I don't want things
to get more complicated.

102
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,960
The whole town is hunting you down.

103
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,560
I know this is your town,

104
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,520
but right now, I’m all you’ve got left.

105
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,880
So tell me.

106
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,160
Please Kahla.

107
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,160
I'm your child's father anyway.

108
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,600
Hm?

109
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
Som Po didn’t come with Kahla.

110
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,200
I think she hasn’t returned yet.

111
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,360
Or perhaps

112
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,440
Eungpueng still hasn’t found Som Po.

113
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,080
Whatever.

114
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,640
Anyway,

115
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,920
why did Kahla tie up the gatekeepers
when she returned to the town?

116
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,720
I think it’s because she wants to find out
the truth about her mother, Angkab.

117
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
- Pudson.
- Yes my Queen?

118
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,840
We need to get Kahla
before her mother does.

119
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,480
The crown suits you well.

120
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
Mother,

121
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,960
if other women see this,
they will criticize it.

122
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,280
Who would dare say anything?
The Queen herself put it on you.

123
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,760
Who would dare to criticize?

124
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,920
But I haven’t even become
a devil-hunter yet.

125
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,200
The position of Queen
is still far from me.

126
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,400
I believe in you.

127
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,480
One day, this crown will be on your head.

128
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Mother,

129
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,120
can I be something else?

130
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,280
I don’t want to be this.

131
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,840
You’re my daughter.

132
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,120
The position of Queen suits you best.

133
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
Som Po,

134
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,800
when will you
come back to wear this crown?

135
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,960
Hey, I'm going now.

136
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,560
I've already got
what Mr. Chan told me to get.

137
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,240
Why would Luang Mitr take Mr. Chan?

138
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,280
I don't know either.

139
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,400
I don't know why he is taking Mr. Chan

140
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,720
and that mysterious woman with him.

141
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,480
Luang Mitr is the only one
who knows the answer.

142
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,640
I don't know. I'm going now.

143
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,520
Som Po.

144
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,040
Why did you capture me?

145
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
We will rest here.

146
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,560
Even though Father
brought us here against our will,

147
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,960
I’m so glad

148
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
that you’re with me.

149
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,560
It helps me

150
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,360
endure the pain
in ways I couldn’t have imagined.

151
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,840
So, Som Po,

152
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,400
when I recover,

153
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
you’ll still be with me, right?

154
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,600
Are Chan and that lady doing well?

155
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,600
Yes Sir.

156
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,040
Alright.

157
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,360
How is Chan doing?

158
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
He's better now.

159
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,120
The doctor just checked on him
and gave him some medicine.

160
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,560
Then Chan fell asleep.

161
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,960
And you,

162
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,200
what are you planning to do?

163
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,960
I…

164
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,800
I have to return to where I came from.

165
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,960
What exactly do you want from me?
Why did you bring me here?

166
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
When Chan gets better,

167
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll send you both to Phra Nakhon,

168
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,680
where you'll give birth to my grandchild.

169
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,680
I can't.

170
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,800
I must give birth at Lady Pua’s house.

171
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,720
I need to go home.

172
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,560
Even if I have to whip you
to the brink of death,

173
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,440
I will take you to give birth
in Phra Nakhon.

174
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,440
Som Po.

175
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,840
What he said was right.

176
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,040
Giving birth in Phra Nakhon
is safer than in your hometown.

177
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Then we can be together as a family.

178
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,960
Father, mother, and child.

179
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,040
Doesn't it sound good?

180
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,040
Yes.

181
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,920
Stop! Who are you? Where are you going?

182
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
Put down your weapon.

183
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,200
Hey!

184
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Whoa.

185
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,120
- You said no one would come here.
- Carrying three sacks is too much,

186
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,520
I can’t do it anymore.

187
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,000
Hurry up Chaba, I want to rest.

188
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,440
I’m so tired Chaba.

189
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,760
Why are you complaining?

190
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,720
If we hadn’t lied about
collecting herbs for the healer’s house,

191
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,840
we wouldn’t have gotten past
the checkpoint to the rebels’ cave.

192
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,240
Alright, I get it.

193
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,160
Just let me grumble a little.

194
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,240
Are you rebels?

195
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,560
Kahla.

196
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,760
You're back.

197
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,640
When did you come back?
Where are you going?

198
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,800
Did you meet Lady Angkab?

199
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,080
How could I meet my mother?

200
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,000
She is…

201
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,400
No, she's still alive.

202
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,800
- Is that true Chaba?
- Yes.

203
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
What happened in Laplae?

204
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Tell me everything.

205
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,160
How is she?

206
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,280
She looks safe Lady Guardian.

207
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,880
Why did you not bring her here?

208
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,600
The path we took has
Lady Warden’s checkpoint.

209
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,600
I’m afraid we’d get caught.

210
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,640
We planned to meet tomorrow

211
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,880
at the edge of the forest behind the town.

212
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,320
There shouldn’t be many people.

213
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,400
I need to relieve myself.

214
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,400
Are you one of the Ngiao or from the Mist?

215
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Tell me!

216
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,720
Tell me now, and I won’t hurt you.

217
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,920
You filthy devil!

218
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,040
You can kill me or do whatever you want.

219
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,920
I’m not afraid.

220
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,040
You all can go back to your duties.

221
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,600
I’ll speak with her myself.

222
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,440
- Yes Sir.
- Yes Sir.

223
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,840
You came from the Town of Mist,
didn’t you?

224
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
There are twins there, I'm told.

225
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,200
Do you know them?

226
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,680
Twins?

227
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,280
Father, you know about the Town of Mist

228
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,600
and the twin ladies too?

229
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,840
Chan, what are you doing here?

230
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,240
You'll catch a fever.

231
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,480
I just needed a change of environment.

232
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,360
By the way,

233
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,320
who is this lady?

234
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,640
I'm investigating her.

235
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,120
She might be one of the Ngiao.

236
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,720
Go back to the tent.

237
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,280
But Father…

238
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,440
We’ll talk tomorrow. Get some rest.

239
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,400
Go.

240
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,520
And tomorrow,

241
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,200
I’ll be back to get your answer.

242
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,280
Let's go.

243
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,240
- Som Po.
- Aunt Eungpueng.

244
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,520
I thought you went back with Kahla.

245
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,120
The Queen sent me to bring you back.

246
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,680
If you don’t return,

247
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,040
how can I go back?

248
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,440
But it’s too dangerous for you
to risk coming out here to help me.

249
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,280
If you don’t return to Laplae with me,

250
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,880
my child will be in danger.

251
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,080
What do you mean?

252
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,920
Queen Bua is holding my child Khemkao

253
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,960
as leverage to bring you back.

254
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,640
How could my mother do that?

255
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,080
The Queen can do even worse

256
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,920
if she doesn’t get what she wants.

257
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,360
Som Po,

258
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,200
you’re about to become a mother.

259
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Please have compassion for another mother.

260
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,880
Please…

261
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,000
help me get my child back.

262
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,160
I promise,

263
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,520
one day I will repay this.

264
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,960
Aw, Som Po, why are you still awake?

265
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,480
Can I boil some water?

266
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
I’m going to make
a nourishing tea for Chan.

267
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,680
Alright.

268
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,200
Sure.

269
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Well…. boil water.

270
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,120
Here you go.

271
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Aya!

272
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,040
This is…

273
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,960
Chrysanthemum. It smells like it.

274
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,120
Hey.

275
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,480
What did you put in there?

276
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,800
This tea is special.

277
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,240
It's rare to find.
It only grows in my town.

278
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,000
When someone is sick or tired,

279
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,480
they drink this tea,

280
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,080
and they'll regain
their strength and energy.

281
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,800
They can even work in the fields
for two days and nights.

282
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,720
Wow.

283
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,120
Awesome.

284
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,200
If it's that good,

285
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,840
can you share with me too?

286
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,160
Do you really want it?

287
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,760
Yes, I do.

288
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,480
I have one condition.

289
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
You can't drink it alone.

290
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,360
You have to share with other people.

291
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,520
Yao.

292
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,840
It's good.

293
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,080
I feel energetic right away.

294
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,680
I'll share with them.

295
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,440
Hey,

296
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,760
Som Po made this.

297
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,240
She said it's a special tea.

298
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,160
When you drink it,

299
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,440
you'll be as strong as an elephant.

300
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,360
Try it.

301
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,120
The soldier said
you went to relieve yourself.

302
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,680
You were gone so long,
I thought you ran away from me.

303
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,920
After I finished,

304
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,600
I went to make you some medicine.

305
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,080
What are you doing? Why don't you rest?

306
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,640
Otherwise, your wound won’t heal.

307
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,920
I'm reviewing the map

308
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,480
and marking locations
for the one who will take over the task,

309
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,960
in case I need to escort you
to give birth in Phra Nakhon.

310
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm very happy to meet you.

311
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,880
You're talking
like you're going to leave me again.

312
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,800
I'll see you every day and every night,

313
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,680
in dreams and while awake.

314
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,600
I'll never forget you.

315
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,520
Drink this medicine,
so your wound will heal.

316
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,000
I won't drink it…

317
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,600
until…

318
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,199
you promise me

319
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,520
that you won't run away from me

320
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
and will stay with me forever.

321
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,840
I promise.

322
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,840
Get changed.

323
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,560
Wait for me in this Laplae forest.

324
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,560
When I see my mother
and everything is alright,

325
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,760
I'll come back and get you.

326
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,280
What are you doing?

327
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,560
Kahla.

328
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,160
Are you sure you're not being fooled?

329
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,720
Chaba and Songpeep
were demoted to be laborers.

330
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,280
With this grudge,
they would never betray me.

331
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
Kahla, I'm so worried.

332
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
I'm afraid something bad
will happen to you and…

333
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
the child.

334
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,600
If you're really as worried as you say,

335
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,200
you need to give me the gun.

336
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
<i>What is this Mother?</i>

337
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,120
Sleeping potion.

338
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,040
Whoever drinks it will sleep
like the dead for an entire day.

339
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,040
Take it with you in case you need it.

340
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Som Po.

341
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,040
Let's go home.

342
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,480
Where are you going Kahla?

343
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,600
Aunt Pudson.

344
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,760
Capture her.

345
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,360
NEXT EPISODE

346
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,520
- Devil!
- Devil!

347
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,640
Hey?

348
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,600
Drink this purifying antidote first.

349
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,680
<i>So I'll forget everything, right?</i>

350
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,240
- Am!
- Let go of me!

351
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,840
<i>Let me talk to the rebels.</i>

352
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,040
<i>Turn yourselves in by tomorrow.</i>

353
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,080
I am the father of Kahla's child.
