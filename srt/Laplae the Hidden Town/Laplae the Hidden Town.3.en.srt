1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,560
The most wicked thing about the devils is…

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,080
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,960
Is a devil as terrifying

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,280
as the teacher described?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,160
On the forthcoming full moon,
the devil-hunting ceremony will begin.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,240
And the last one
to be selected is Songpeep.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,880
How can my daughter Pakkad not pass?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,200
You are in an affair with her mother.
How can someone like this be a judge?

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,320
The final selection
of this year's devil-hunters

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
should be judged by Goddess Som.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,080
- Let Goddess Som decide.
- Let Goddess Som decide.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,320
<i>Teacher,</i>
<i>where did our ancestors come from,</i>

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,680
<i>and how long have</i>
<i>the people of Laplae lived here?</i>

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,240
<i>In the past, our foremothers</i>

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>fled from another place,</i>

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>escaping the oppression of the devils.</i>

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,160
<i>They discovered this pure land</i>
<i>in this valley,</i>

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,560
<i>protected by Goddess Som.</i>

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>She not only shielded Laplae</i>

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,040
<i>with a thick wall of mist,</i>

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,680
<i>but also blessed us</i>
<i>with the golden turmeric,</i>

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,520
<i>a plant with countless</i>
<i>miraculous benefits.</i>

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,160
<i>This is why we must conduct ourselves</i>
<i>with grace and honor,</i>

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,720
<i>in gratitude for Goddess Som’s kindness.</i>

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,320
<i>We follow the guidance</i>
<i>of our Queen because she was</i>

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>chosen by Goddess Som herself,</i>

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,560
<i>and under their leadership,</i>
<i>the people of Laplae</i>

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,720
<i>have lived in peace and prosperity</i>

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>for generations.</i>

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,280
Now,

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,760
my time is coming to an end.

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,360
It is time for a transition.

33
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,720
Are you alright?

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Yes.

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,280
We're almost there.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
My goodness!

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,720
I apologize Lady Healer.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
- It's alright.
- I'm sorry.

39
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
No problem.

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Mother.

41
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,280
What is it like outside?
Have you forgotten?

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,520
I’ve always wanted
to see it with my own eyes.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,240
You have to go hunt the devils.
Don’t waste time wandering.

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,320
Bring back a daughter.

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,680
Of course. A great task lies ahead.

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,040
I don't have much time left.

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,880
Tomorrow at dawn,
I must attend the final ceremony.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,320
So, let me go hang around first.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
I'll see you at home tomorrow.

50
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
Pakkad.

51
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,240
Step out. You didn't pass.

52
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,560
Lady Healer, it's my fault.
Please give me another chance.

53
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,520
Lady Healer, please hear me.

54
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,200
I can do it. I know I can do it.
Please give me one more chance.

55
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,480
I said you didn't pass.

56
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,160
I can't go out like this. Please listen…

57
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,400
Please give me one more chance.

58
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,920
- Get out.
- Lady Healer.

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,760
I can't go out like this. I can't…

60
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,960
During the ritual to summon Goddess Som,

61
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,160
The four of you, Fuangfah, Som Po

62
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Mamao and Ruangpueng,

63
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,120
must place your hands
into the sacred pond,

64
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,680
with the five devil-hunters as witnesses.

65
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,200
Are you all ready?

66
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,960
Alright. It's about time.

67
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,400
May the Queen
focus your mind on Goddess Som,

68
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,480
to receive her guidance
through this holy act

69
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,520
of placing your hands into the sacred pond

70
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,800
which young woman is the most worthy.

71
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,760
Place your right hand
into the sacred pond.

72
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,760
Homage to the goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

73
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,920
Homage to the goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

74
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,160
Homage to the goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

75
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Som Po, your hand…

76
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,559
The touch from Goddess Som

77
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,440
is as radiant as gold.

78
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,480
We've found the last devil-hunter.

79
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,440
Thank you Goddess Som.

80
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,360
Thank you Goddess Som.

81
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,400
Thank you Goddess Som.

82
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm happy for you Som Po.

83
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,000
You have the kindest
and most generous heart among us.

84
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
You deserve this more than I do.

85
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,720
Goddess Som has made her choice.

86
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,080
And I like plants.

87
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,800
Returning to farming would be nice.

88
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,120
Som Po looks so beautiful.

89
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
Yes, she is.

90
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,240
The last devil-hunter of the year

91
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,360
personally chosen by Goddess Som,

92
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,520
a woman with a pure and gracious heart.

93
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,400
Som Po,

94
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,440
- the daughter of Queen Bua. Our daughter.
- Wow.

95
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,760
- She deserves it.
- She is so beautiful.

96
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,560
- She deserves it.
- Yes.

97
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
My goodness!

98
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,320
- It's alright.
- I apologize Lady Healer.

99
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,520
It's alright.

100
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,840
You're up late.

101
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
You'll be tired tomorrow.

102
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,080
Mother, if I place my hand into the pond,

103
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,160
do you think it will turn gold too?

104
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,880
I saw Som Po’s hand covered in gold leaf,

105
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,440
shining even more brilliantly
than golden turmeric. I was amazed.

106
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,080
Is it real gold?

107
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,080
Or just a trick?

108
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,960
Keep this, in case you're in danger.

109
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,640
Take care of your life
in case things don’t go as planned.

110
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,520
Mother.

111
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,360
Then…

112
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,720
- If I get a son…
- Hey.

113
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
Don’t talk nonsense.

114
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
I was just kidding.

115
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,080
It's not a joke.

116
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,840
Goddess Som will hate you.
You won't ever see me again. Understand?

117
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
Go to bed.

118
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Lady Guardian Angkab is here.

119
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,120
She will lead
the devil-hunters to the misty edge.

120
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,520
The auspicious day has come once again.

121
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,040
<i>The great responsibility of our land</i>

122
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,440
<i>now rests in your hands,</i>
<i>the devil-hunters.</i>

123
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,480
<i>May you return as mothers to daughters,</i>

124
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,600
<i>helping to expand and strengthen our land.</i>

125
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,360
<i>Know that you are all</i>

126
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,960
<i>full of skill and virtue,</i>

127
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,880
<i>the hope of our people,</i>

128
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,920
<i>and the pride of every mother.</i>

129
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,600
Before leaving Laplae,

130
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,560
let me remind you once again
of the rules for hunting devils,

131
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,760
so you can remember them well.

132
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,880
Devil-hunting is considered a sacred duty

133
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,080
to increase the population of our town.

134
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,200
<i>Every child born must be a girl.</i>

135
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,040
<i>If you give birth to a devil-child,</i>
<i>which is considered a curse,</i>

136
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,800
<i>that child must be cast into the water.</i>

137
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,000
<i>You and your mother</i>

138
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,800
<i>will be demoted to laborers.</i>

139
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,280
<i>The laws of our land</i>
<i>make no exceptions for anyone,</i>

140
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,480
<i>not even the daughter of the Queen.</i>
<i>If you give birth to a cursed child,</i>

141
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,360
<i>the position</i>
<i>will be passed to someone else.</i>

142
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
<i>So, remember this well.</i>

143
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,600
<i>Use whatever you have learned</i>
<i>to the best of your ability.</i>

144
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,720
Behind this mist gate,
is the outside world.

145
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,320
- Are you all ready?
- Yes.

146
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,160
Som Po, you go first.

147
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
Alright.

148
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,880
- Oh.
- It's opening.

149
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,440
- How is this possible?
- We're about to go outside.

150
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,760
Look at the golden turmeric in your hands.

151
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Golden turmeric
is a magical plant in Laplae,

152
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,600
but in the outside world, it is gold,

153
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,880
something outsiders desire.

154
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,080
This golden turmeric
must be kept hidden from others.

155
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,520
It is the key
that will bring you back to Laplae.

156
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,320
Do you understand?

157
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,440
- We understand.
- We understand.

158
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,800
- That's a thief!
- Stop!

159
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,120
Aaaah!

160
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,480
Where are you going?

161
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,000
- Hey.
- Stop!

162
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,240
Everyone, look at this.
We're almost there.

163
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,960
When we reach the maiden’s house,
we must keep ourselves hidden from sight.

164
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,000
The house is likely far
from the villagers.

165
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,960
You can choose.

166
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,560
- Do you want to eat?
- Yeah, let's take a look.

167
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Do you want this?

168
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,200
- And this…
- What would you like?

169
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,200
I'm very nervous.

170
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,240
Please have a look.

171
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,560
There are girls.

172
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,680
Do you like them? I like them?

173
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,600
No?

174
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,280
If you don’t hurry
and find a woman yourself,

175
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,720
your father will marry you off
to someone you don’t even know.

176
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
It seems you know more about women
than about making maps, Henry.

177
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,080
Oh.

178
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,840
Or do you want a woman from my house?

179
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,960
Your father will definitely kill me.

180
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,320
Just for working with me,
your father already hates me.

181
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,080
Oh.

182
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,840
Everyone, I think we found it.

183
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

184
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,800
Can't she talk?

185
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,800
I don't think so.

186
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
Good, the secret won’t leak out.

187
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,480
Hey.

188
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,960
That's right.

189
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,000
That's right.

190
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,200
Let's go.

191
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,680
- Rampoei.
- Oh.

192
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Everyone.

193
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,160
Everyone.

194
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,480
She said this is our bedroom.

195
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,640
- Bedroom.
- Oh, bedroom.

196
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,320
What is she bringing us?

197
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,560
- What is that?
- I don't know either.

198
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,280
She said that eating this

199
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,800
will make your skin beautiful and radiant.

200
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,920
- Am I correct?
- Oh, you're right.

201
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,120
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

202
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
- It smells good.
- Does it?

203
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,160
She said she picked it all for us.

204
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,760
Oh.

205
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,320
- And…
- Beautiful.

206
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,160
So beautiful.

207
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,960
She said to try smelling it.

208
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,840
- Can I smell it?
- Yes.

209
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,080
It smells so good.
I think it must have Cananga mixed in.

210
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,760
The scent is so similar.

211
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,800
Beautiful.

212
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,280
The color is so beautiful.

213
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,360
Thank you.

214
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,320
Look.

215
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,920
Watch your clothes.

216
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,920
The map says if we walk a little more,
we’ll see a large group of people.

217
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,040
Will we see the devils?

218
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
There.

219
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,800
Chaba.

220
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,880
Kahla, be careful.

221
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,960
I smell something bad.

222
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,400
His lips are hairy,
and his skin is rough like clay.

223
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,120
Devil.

224
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,560
- Huh?
- Huh?

225
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,040
Why does a devil look like this?
His face and body are red.

226
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,320
His hair is messy. And he smells bad.

227
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,000
It smells so bad.

228
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,880
Let's go.

229
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,800
Please come take a look.

230
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,120
Please come take a look.

231
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,040
Oh.

232
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,160
Let's go.

233
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,720
Are we really going in Kahla?

234
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,080
Yes, let's see what is interesting.
Let's go.

235
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,480
Devils.

236
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,080
There are a lot of devils.
This town must be cursed.

237
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,320
- Yes.
- Let's go.

238
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,600
Let's go.

239
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,640
There are a lot of devils. I'm scared.

240
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,280
What are you scared of?
You have to sleep with them.

241
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,200
Goddess Som will punish you severely
for such wickedness.

242
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,320
- So bad.
- Be quiet. Not so loud.

243
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,040
- Hey.
- Chaba fainted.

244
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,000
- There's nothing.
- Let's go.

245
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,480
Hurry up.

246
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,240
- Chaba.
- Chaba.

247
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,120
There's nothing.

248
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,640
Come here.

249
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,640
Please wait a bit.

250
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,800
Yes. He's with his mother.

251
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,400
- Is it finished yet?
- Almost.

252
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,600
- It's so tight.
- In case it's far.

253
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,480
- Is it far Sir?
- It's there.

254
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,120
Next time, bring the whole army
to drink at the market.

255
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,400
Scooping from the jar is more satisfying!

256
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,440
I just stopped by,
so I'm buying it for them.

257
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
We have to leave soon. We won't stay long.

258
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,720
- Are you going back to the city?
- We're going north.

259
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,120
If it's good, I'll come back.

260
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,880
This is a special recipe.

261
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I feel like I’m going to throw up.

262
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,880
I wonder if this sin will stay with me.

263
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,000
I want to jump into the well
to wash away the heavy sins

264
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,320
from this barbaric town.

265
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,480
- I'm stressed.
- I bow to you Goddess Som.

266
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,840
- I bow to you Goddess Som.
- Please don't punish me.

267
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,480
I didn't mean it.

268
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,280
I didn't know it would be this barbaric.

269
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,560
Goddess Som, I apologize.

270
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,640
You’re overthinking it.

271
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,240
The sin won’t stay with you.

272
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,400
You didn’t kill it with your own hands.

273
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,720
That's right. I didn't kill it.

274
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,720
Exactly. You keep making a fuss.

275
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,960
Our mothers taught us not to
speak loudly, or we’ll draw attention.

276
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,080
You're shouting your head off,

277
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,360
and it's really getting on my nerves.

278
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,880
I've never seen it. There are only
pure-hearted women in Laplae.

279
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,560
The devils are truly cruel,
finding joy in the sight of blood.

280
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,600
I want to go home.

281
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,080
Som Po.

282
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,960
There's blood on your clothes.

283
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,480
Is it fish blood?

284
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,320
Fish blood?

285
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,000
That must be it.

286
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,800
Whoa, I'm tired.

287
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,760
It's a strange-looking gold.
Where did you get it?

288
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,400
How much?

289
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,800
I think it's one <i>feung</i>.

290
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,120
Too low.

291
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,400
I'm giving you a lot.
It's just a small one.

292
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,800
Alright then.

293
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,560
Alright, 20 <i>satangs</i> then.

294
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,720
One quarter.

295
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,480
Two quarters. Are you going to sell it?

296
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,440
The price is higher than I thought.

297
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,720
Think carefully. Are you selling it?

298
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,000
‪Ugh!

299
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,120
How are you Min?

300
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,679
Aw.

301
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,800
How did you get here Jai?

302
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,000
There are a lot of Siamese soldiers.

303
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,480
Thank you for your concern.

304
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,520
If you’re concerned,
why don’t you help us fight?

305
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,920
You know I'm not good at fighting.

306
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,679
I just want to trade
and make a good profit.

307
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,880
If the Thais become governors in Phrae,

308
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,639
we won’t be able to do anything freely.

309
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,400
They think the Thais are with the British.

310
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,120
What do you want me to do?

311
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,960
Keep us updated
about the Siamese soldiers.

312
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,120
But I--

313
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,600
Alright. I can do it.

314
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,000
I bow to you Goddess Som.

315
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,160
The devils…

316
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,320
The devils are more cruel
than what we've learned.

317
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,960
Can our skills and knowledge handle them?

318
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,560
We'll all die.

319
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,320
How can I hunt a devil?

320
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Even though you are Daughter of the Queen,

321
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,880
if you keep looking gloomy and do nothing,
your fate can still change.

322
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,840
There's no time to worry.
This is very important.

323
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,920
If you want to go back to Laplae as soon
as possible, you must do your best.

324
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,160
Remember why we are here.

325
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,920
We must return home with honor.

326
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,960
Hunt the devils. We can do it.

327
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,080
Do it for our daughters and Laplae.

328
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,320
I think it works.

329
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,280
I think they are exactly
what we're looking for.

330
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,000
- They appear strong and vigorous.
- With a broad chest.

331
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,840
- Firm buttocks.
- And not short.

332
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,440
I'll go first.

333
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,600
She's coming.

334
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,240
Hey.

335
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,160
She's good.

336
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,000
- Hey.
- What?

337
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,960
The gaze.

338
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,240
The touch.

339
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,880
The devil-slaying buttocks.

340
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,680
Turn them on and then leave.

341
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,160
Amazing.

342
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,120
She got it.

343
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,120
It's my turn.

344
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,080
- Hey.
- It works.

345
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,000
I need to find a place without war
so I can trade and make a lot of money.

346
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,480
- Let me try.
- Go ahead.

347
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,120
Where is it?

348
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,400
There's nothing.

349
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,720
Som Po.

350
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,800
Som Po.

351
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,480
Som Po.

352

NEXT EPISODE

353
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,920
But I wonder why the mist demons
are coming down to harm people.

354
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,320
<i>I’ve checked Lady Guardian Angkab’s house.</i>

355
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,600
<i>I couldn't find her.</i>
