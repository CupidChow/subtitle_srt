4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,560
‪PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,360
<i>But I wonder</i>

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,239
<i>why the Mist Demon</i>
<i>is coming here to harm people.</i>

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,200
<i>I’ve checked Lady Guardian Angkab’s house.</i>

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,680
<i>We found no trace of Lady Guardian Angkab.</i>

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,880
What are we to each other?

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,400
<i>Anchan lost a lot of blood</i>

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>and died during childbirth.</i>

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,880
Finally, you're back Lady Guardian.

13
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,640
You fled beyond the mist.

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
Broke the rules and angered Goddess Som.

15
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,080
Arrest her.

16
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,720
Excuse me Sir.

17
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,920
Alright.

18
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,840
I sent someone
to gather news at the market.

19
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
They didn't find the Ngiao,

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,840
but they found Mr. Chan, your son.

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
With the foreigners?

22
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,600
Yes Sir.

23
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
He follows the foreign railway workers,

24
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,400
defying his father every day.

25
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,720
If I had known that, I’d have him marry
and stay in Phra Nakhon.

26
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,240
It’s exhausting to talk about.

27
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,320
I just hope that Chan

28
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
doesn’t foolishly make his way up
to the Phayap region.

29
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, we've got one more report Sir.

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,000
Say it.

31
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,640
It seems that some of us in the city are
aiding the Ngiao,

32
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
handing over the commissioner to them.

33
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,360
There are also rumors that… well…

34
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,080
What? Say it.

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,320
The Ngiao in Chiang Mai,
Lampang, and Phayao

36
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,320
have similar plans to those in Phrae.

37
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,640
They’re getting too bold.

38
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,120
Let's wait for
reinforcements from Phitsanulok.

39
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
We will mobilize our troops to crush them.

40
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
We're here now.

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
If we want to build
a railway to Chiang Mai,

42
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,160
we have to go through a lot of mountains.

43
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Where is the shortcut
you mentioned earlier?

44
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,960
This route here.
The mountains aren’t too steep,

45
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
but there is a creek flowing through it

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,080
and the area is often shrouded in fog.

47
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,680
If we fill in that creek,

48
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,520
we can make a route through it.

49
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
It would be faster
than going through mountains.

50
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
I agree.

51
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,760
You can't.

52
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,960
The elders say

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
it’s dangerous,

54
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,720
and the area is heavily haunted by ghosts.

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,200
Ghosts? I told you.

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
That guy told me

57
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,920
men would be lured
into the forest by ghosts,

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,080
and then they’d eat
their liver, kidneys, heart

59
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,000
- and everything.
- Enough.

60
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,040
The bosses are discussing business.

61
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,080
Stop talking nonsense.

62
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
If the tree nymphs are real,

63
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,040
they will probably fall head over heels

64
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,800
for our Mr. Chan,
just like the women in the market.

65
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,560
- What are you afraid of?
- Well said.

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,640
You’re so cheeky Am.

67
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,440
What kind of decent woman
would fall head over heels

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,320
right after meeting me?

69
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,560
See?

70
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,720
<i>You may be better than anyone else.</i>

71
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,760
<i>That's why Goddess Som</i>
<i>sent you in my dream.</i>

72
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,440
Chan.

73
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,920
What did you say?

74
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm going back now.

75
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,760
Thank you Village Chief.

76
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,000
- Alright.
- Thank you.

77
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,880
Have a safe trip.

78
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,520
Henry.

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Actually, we should report the new route

80
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,920
to the Ministry of Public Works
in Phra Nakhon first.

81
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
I think we need to delay
the survey for a few days.

82
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,360
I want to survey the shortcut now.

83
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,400
- Am, Yao.
- Yes Mr.Chan?

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
Yes.

85
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
Am,

86
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
Go tell the porters

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,360
to pack up and get ready to depart.

88
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,320
Yes Sir.

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,600
- Yao.
- Yes?

90
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,120
Go tell the porters

91
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
that we'll leave early in the morning.

92
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,120
Yes Sir.

93
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,400
Hey.

94
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,680
Go get the bags. We're going today.

95
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,200
I don't understand.

96
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Go get the bags. We're going now.

97
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
Now?

98
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,720
Are you ready?

99
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,440
- Let's go.
- Alright.

100
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
Lady Guardian,

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,960
why did you go out of Laplae?

102
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,280
You’ve broken a serious rule.

103
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,320
You should face severe punishment.

104
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,679
I‘d like to use my rights as the Queen.

105
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,000
I request to interrogate
Lady Guardian alone.

106
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Angkab, why did you break the rule

107
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
and cause this chaos?

108
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,000
If there's a reason,
I'll help find a solution.

109
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Anchan, my sister.

110
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,680
Eighteen years ago,

111
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,040
what exactly happened to her?

112
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,400
Why bring up that old issue?

113
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
It happened like everyone knew.

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,440
She was unfortunate
and died while giving birth.

115
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,400
No.

116
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,640
I saw her with my own eyes.
Anchan is alive.

117
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,080
There’s no way.
You must be deceived by the mist.

118
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,120
No, Anchan is really alive.

119
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,520
But she has forgotten everything
about this town and me.

120
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,880
What happened to her?

121
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,400
Her body is in the cemetery.

122
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
There's just a log there.

123
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,560
What did you and Lady Bongkod hide?

124
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
There's nothing to hide.

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
That's all I know.

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
You're lying.

127
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,360
You and your daughter are liars.

128
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,280
Liars.

129
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,920
How can you say that?

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
You're the one who broke the rule
and went out of town.

131
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,000
Goddess Som was angry
and sent the Mist Demon.

132
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,280
I'm trying to help you
find a way out as a friend,

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,280
but you still don’t get it.

134
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,240
Let me go, liars.

135
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,920
Admit it.

136
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
You went out of town with bad intentions.

137
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,320
You wanted to help Kahla
gain an advantage in the devil-hunt.

138
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,120
No.

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,520
I went out because I saw Anchan.

140
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Anchan?

141
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,080
You're using a dead sister as an excuse?

142
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,840
In fact,

143
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,440
you want your daughter to be Queen.

144
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,640
Your greed and ambition

145
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,360
angered Goddess Som.

146
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,560
If Goddess Som were truly angry,

147
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,480
Laplae would have fallen long ago

148
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,360
because we’ve had dishonest queens

149
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,600
since the last one.

150
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,520
Shut your deceitful mouth!

151
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
My mouth is not deceitful.

152
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,960
Your ears listen only to lies

153
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,800
and you can’t tell right from wrong.

154
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,720
<i>From here, if I go a little further,</i>

155
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,120
<i>there will be a village</i>
<i>where my father was once stationed.</i>

156
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,560
<i>Do I go left or right now?</i>

157
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,320
Devil Chan.

158
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,200
You're not a liar. You came back.

159
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,120
Eh?

160
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,160
You've been waiting here?

161
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,040
And if I didn't come back,

162
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,840
would you keep waiting here forever?

163
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,560
Just go home.

164
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Am I…

165
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
not good enough to mate with?

166
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
It's not like that.

167
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
If you don't mate with me,

168
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
how can I go home?

169
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,200
I don’t see how that’s relevant at all.

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,880
I need a daughter, so I can go home.

171
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,720
Your traditions are indeed strange,

172
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,640
but it seems
there’s nothing I can do to help.

173
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,680
I’ve made up my mind

174
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
that I will only marry
a woman I truly love.

175
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,440
And I…

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,360
won't touch her

177
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,280
until we get married.

178
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Love?

179
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,880
Marry?

180
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes.

181
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,360
Then…

182
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,720
how can I love?

183
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
Love…

184
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,400
may begin with
an attraction to appearance

185
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,480
and personality,

186
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,280
and then gradually develop
into a deep bond.

187
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,760
I warn you once again, do not try

188
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,920
to take advantage
of me without permission.

189
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,600
If you do,

190
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,960
I'll leave you alone
in the middle of the woods.

191
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
Do you understand?

192
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,040
- Alright. Follow me.
- Wait.

193
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,200
If you allow it, I can touch you, right?

194
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
Whoa!

195
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,920
What should I do?

196
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,160
- Huh?
- Nothing.

197
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,720
Mr. Henry.

198
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,280
- Yes?
- I think

199
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,720
we should go back and sleep.

200
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,640
Whoa.

201
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,600
We're here now.

202
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Mr. Henry.

203
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,520
Mr. Henry.

204
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,800
You're awake. Let’s part ways here.

205
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,680
This morning, I need to continue
to survey the railway route.

206
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Which way are you going?

207
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
Can I go with you?

208
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,960
If a close bond forms

209
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,320
and you fall in love,

210
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
we may be able to copulate.

211
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,680
Well. Alright.

212
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,880
Where is your home?

213
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
If it's the same way,
you can come with me.

214
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,120
You're a woman,
traveling alone is dangerous.

215
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,800
My town is deep in the forest,

216
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,320
in a valley surrounded by mountains,

217
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,960
in the heart of the mist.

218
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,760
<i>This route here.</i>

219
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,040
The mountains aren’t too steep,
but there is a creek

220
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,240
flowing through it.

221
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,480
And the area is heavily haunted by ghosts.

222
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,920
Or…

223
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,760
Help!

224
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,440
Help!

225
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
Anyone, help!

226
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,200
Good luck. If there's a chance,
we may meet again.

227
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,240
Ghost.

228
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,240
Hey Yao.

229
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,080
Yao.

230
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
I can't stay here. Let's run away.

231
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,440
What?

232
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,520
What happened to Yao?

233
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,960
He’s so scared that he’s lost his mind.

234
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,720
Last night, he went to survey the place
the Village Chief mentioned

235
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
with Mr. Henry.

236
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,800
- Yes.
- And suddenly,

237
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,360
he saw a white mist.

238
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,560
A ghost came out of the mist.

239
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,600
Where's Henry?

240
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,720
Yao said that Henry

241
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
disappeared into the mist.

242
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,880
Do you know the location
where he disappeared?

243
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,680
We're going to find Henry.

244
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,280
I think he might have just gotten lost.

245
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Am, come with me.

246
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,160
No Sir.

247
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,720
I won't go and I don't know anything.

248
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,040
I love my life too Mr. Chan.

249
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,560
Fine, if you’re that scared,

250
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,880
I’ll go find my friend on my own.

251
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,000
You can stay here and cower.

252
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,240
Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan

253
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,160
I'm not going.

254
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,880
Are you a forest spirit?
You're everywhere.

255
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,840
The other devils are scary.

256
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
I don't want to be near them.

257
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,880
But I'm not scared of you.

258
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,320
Did your friend disappear?

259
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
How do you know?

260
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,520
Well…

261
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Don't tell me you followed me to the camp.

262
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,880
I didn't mean to do that.

264
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,000
Listen Som Po,

265
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,320
you said your town is in a misty valley.

266
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,960
My friend disappeared around there.

267
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,640
Can you take me to find him?

268
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,880
No.

269
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,680
Why not?

270
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,200
I can't take you there.

271
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,720
Actually, I know some directions.

272
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,160
It's better if I go by myself.

273
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
Wait. It's dangerous there.

274
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,680
Don't go alone.

275
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,320
Don't worry Som Po.

276
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm not afraid of any danger now.

277
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,600
You don't need to trust me
on other things.

278
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,560
But trust me on this.

279
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,200
Disappeared in the mist?

280
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,920
Yes.

281
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Could you please spare some soldiers

282
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,800
to help me find my friend?

283
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,720
These soldiers

284
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
are on duty for Siam.

285
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,320
Do you want them to help your friend?

286
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,120
Chan.

287
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,960
But a person is in danger.

288
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,560
This is urgent Father.

289
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Is it more urgent than handling the Ngiao?

290
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,480
Let me tell you Chan.

291
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,520
I think you should quit

292
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,760
and serve as a soldier

293
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,080
and stop exploring these routes.

294
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,680
This ridiculous route you're talking about

295
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,400
will bring enormous change

296
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,840
to our Siam.

297
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,760
If you won’t consider me,

298
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,600
at least think of your mother.

299
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,600
Your mother

300
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,600
had high hopes for you.

301
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,480
I apologize if I disappointed you.

302
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
If you don't want to help,

303
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,880
I'll find Henry by myself.

304
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,880
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

305
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,120
Alright.

306
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,440
That guy, Henry,

307
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,280
I'll send the soldiers to help find him.

308
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,680
But you have to go to Phrae with me.

309
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,080
No.

310
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,560
I'll handle it myself.

311
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,320
Luang Mitr, we found a foreigner’s body

312
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,040
in the forest.

313
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,080
Henry!

314
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,040
What happened?

315
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,920
Henry, what happened?

316
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,880
Is it the Ngiao?

317
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,320
Henry is not Siamese.
Why would the Ngiao kill him?

318
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,680
All his belongings
and his gun are still here.

319
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,560
The marks don’t resemble
those of a wild animal at all.

320
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,840
It's very strange.

321
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,640
How could it be strange?

322
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,000
These are definitely
the marks of a wild beast.

323
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,960
Or is it like the rumors say?

324
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,280
About the women ghosts from the mist?

325
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,840
They look like normal women

326
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,600
- but actually--
- Shut up.

327
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,920
This might not be nonsense after all.

328
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,640
I told you, didn't I?

329
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,160
Are there ghosts here?

330
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,080
Anyone who talks such nonsense to me again

331
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,800
will be punished.

332
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,560
Chan, stay here tonight.

333
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,960
I'll have your accommodations arranged.

334
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,360
Are you crying Devil Chan?

335
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Stop following me.

336
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,480
Won't your father help find your friend?

337
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,840
My friend is dead!

338
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,880
My friend used to do this.

339
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,240
She said it would relieve stress.

340
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,160
I also have a friend that I love.

341
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,040
If she dies,

342
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,920
I may be…

343
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,400
Hello Lady Healer.

344
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,400
Hello.

345
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,920
Queen Bua sent me to ask

346
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,680
if you've finished
preparing the purifying antidote.

347
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,440
It’s almost time
for the devil-hunters to return home.

348
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,000
Are these rose petals
used to make the purifying antidote?

349
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,280
Yes.

350
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,120
Here.

351
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,720
I’ve left them out under the moonlight
for three nights now.

352
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,840
I still need to mix them
with snake-venom grass

353
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,320
and other herbs

354
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
to complete it.

355
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,800
I've never been a devil-hunter,
so I don't know what it tastes like.

356
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,120
How sweet is it? Have you tasted it?

357
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,160
I don't remember how it tastes.

358
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,320
The more tainted someone is,
the more they need to take, right?

359
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,200
The more you take, the more you forget.

360
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,680
The less you take, the less you forget.

361
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,640
It's good that you've never tasted it.

362
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,320
It means you've never been tainted

363
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,720
and never made any mistakes.

364
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,480
I want to live righteously,

365
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,160
worthy of being a servant of Queen Bua.

366
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,320
Aw?

367
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
Hey!

368
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,320
This is clearly bandit territory.

369
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,360
Som Po, when will we get pregnant?

370
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,000
So we can go home.

371
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,960
Som Po.

372
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,120
Somsook.

373
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,520
- Somsook.
- Somsook.

374
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,400
What happened?

375
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,560
The vile devil that Somsook was with

376
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,200
plans to sell her in a gambling house.

377
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,120
The people here are barbaric,

378
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,360
trading human beings like objects.

379
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,240
You must be shocked.

380
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,280
It wasn’t the shock that got to me,

381
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,000
but the pain,

382
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,400
the heartache.

383
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,320
The elders have warned us

384
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,800
not to fall for the devils.

385
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,560
Even if they don’t smell or look bad,

386
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,720
their hearts are twisted.

387
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,360
I want to go home.

388
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,240
It won't be long.

389
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,960
After all, you and I are already pregnant.

390
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,680
Chaba, Somsook, are you pregnant?

391
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,880
That's good news. I'm happy for you.

392
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,040
When you go back to Laplae,

393
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,280
you'll take the purifying antidote

394
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,560
and forget all the pain.

395
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,920
Yes.

396
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,440
Songpeep and I are pregnant.

397
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,000
Are you also pregnant?

398
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,640
Yes, our urines

399
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,640
changed its color
after we put the powder in.

400
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,440
We're pregnant.

401
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,560
It was worth losing sleep all night

402
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,600
to hunt the devils.

403
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,600
Goddess Som might be
kind enough to grant me twins.

404
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
We're going to pack and leave the house.

405
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,080
How about you? Are you pregnant?

406
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,640
Somsook and I are pregnant too.

407
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,520
We're getting ready to go back.

408
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,360
And… where is Som Po?

409
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,640
How about you Kahla?

410
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,080
I'm not pregnant yet.

411
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,840
You can go back first.
I'll wait for Som Po here.

412
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,640
Then, Queen Rampoei

413
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,240
will go home now.

414
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's get ready.

415
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,240
That's enough.

416
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,639
I feel better now Som Po.

417
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,880
Devil Chan, please.

418
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,040
Please copulate with me.

419
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,480
I must follow the tradition
and get pregnant

420
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,000
to continue the lineage.

421
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,120
You just want a child?

422
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,159
Don't you care about other things?

423
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
About what?

424
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,560
About… feelings.

425
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,800
You make me feel like you just want…

426
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,400
a sire.

427
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,679
So what?

428
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,719
If so,

429
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,640
go find one in the market.

430
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,640
I believe there are people
who would want to copulate with you.

431
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,440
But I don't have much time.

432
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,480
- I want you.
- No!

433
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,840
Lady Guardian Angkab
has committed a serious offense

434
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,720
and can no longer hold her position.

435
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,920
From now on, Eungpueng,

436
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,000
you will temporarily
take on the role of Lady Guardian

437
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,360
to oversee the Misty Edge.

438
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,040
Please swear that

439
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,720
you will carry out
your duties with honesty

440
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,160
for Goddess Som

441
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,160
and the people of Laplae.

442
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,800
I swear.

443
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,520
Excuse me,

444
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,760
How is Lady Guardian Ang--

445
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,440
How is Lady Angkab now?

446
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,280
I heard she is in jail.

447
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,560
Whether it is the will of Goddess Som

448
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,040
or some other misfortune,

449
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,160
she has now lost her mind,

450
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,120
hallucinating and rambling.

451
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,360
It is truly a pitiful sight.

452
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,360
Whatever the case may be,

453
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,520
let me see Lady Guardian Angkab, please.

454
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,320
If you are truly loyal to her,

455
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,040
show mercy
and let her retain some dignity.

456
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,880
Turn your loyalty

457
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,320
into doing what's best for our land.

458
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,680
Then,

459
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,480
I must leave.

460
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
That's right.

461
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,160
I only need a sire.

462
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,200
Just any devil.

463
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,760
Let's do it.

464
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,200
I have to do it.

465
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,640
Wait. Stop.

466
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,080
Why?

467
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,440
- Stay still.
- Wait.

468
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,440
I said stay still. Don't you like it?

469
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,560
Stay still.

470
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,920
No. Stop.

471
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,880
Stop.

472
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,080
Stay still.

473
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,600
Wait.

474
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,320
Hey.

475
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,400
Devil Chan.

476
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,040
Visitors are not allowed?
Why is it that strict?

477
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,400
Angkab is a serious criminal.

478
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
She intentionally broke the rule
and angered Goddess Som.

479
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,920
I heard she lost her mind,
seeing hallucinations.

480
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,720
Why don't you treat her first?

481
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,880
Lady Healer is preparing the medicine.

482
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,960
But if you're here,
who's guarding the Misty Edge?

483
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,880
Guards are in place.

484
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,320
The situation is normal,

485
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,600
just like every day.

486
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,800
If the security was good enough,

487
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,600
how did you let the Demon in last time?

488
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,480
You're leaving your duty

489
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,080
while the Demon is around.

490
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,400
You should all be jailed.

491
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,680
<i>The Queen played the flute</i>

492
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,120
after the Mist Demon appeared?

493
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,320
That's right.
You were unconscious at that time.

494
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,520
If not for the Queen,

495
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,960
we would have all died.

496
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,160
<i>But that day, I heard the flute</i>

497
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,280
<i>before the Mist Demon appeared.</i>

498
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,680
NEXT EPISODE

499
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,960
The Siamese took our people.

500
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,640
No.

501
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,800
Hey.

502
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,160
Anchan gave birth to a devil.

503
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,120
Liar.

504
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,000
It seems she hasn’t learned her lesson.

505
