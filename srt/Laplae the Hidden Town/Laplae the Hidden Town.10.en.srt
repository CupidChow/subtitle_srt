00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,080
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Watch out!

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,960
- Som Po!
- Back off.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,080
Som Po!

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,560
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,400
You'll be alright.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,760
Your mother has passed away.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,680
The devil just saved my life.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,720
Didn't you see it?

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,760
The Queen really cheated for her daughter.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,360
- That's right.
- The Queen cheated.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,920
<i>If you’re going to start a war,</i>

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
<i>you must begin stockpiling weapons.</i>

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
Lady Guardian is still alive, right?

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,600
It's just one gold stick.
Why is it so hard?

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,760
Who said I only want one?

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,320
How do you use that gun?

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,320
Kahla.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,480
Where are you now?

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
Kahla.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,400
Where are you?

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Kahla.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
Did you buy the bullets?

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,640
How do you use that gun?

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,960
The gun is gone.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,200
The gun is gone.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,480
Kahla!

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,480
Kahla!

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,960
- Reinforcements are coming from…
- Khun Luang.

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,440
Khun Luang.

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Khun Luang, please help.

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,280
Please help.

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,320
- Am.
- Khun Luang, please help.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,160
Khun Luang, please help.

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,120
What's wrong? What's the matter?

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
Mr. Chan…

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,120
What happened to my son?

40
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,200
Mr. Chan got stabbed.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,640
He won't stop bleeding.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Chan.

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,840
Chan.

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,360
Chan.

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,600
Why is my son on the verge of death
like this?7

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,560
Doctors.

47
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
What is that?

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
It’s likely a hemostatic herb

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,120
used in traditional first aid
by villagers Sir.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,480
Alright.

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720
My goodness.

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
The wound is deep and alarming.

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,480
We must hurry back
to the camp for treatment.

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,000
If the wound isn’t stitched up in time,
he could bleed out entirely.

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
Take my son to the camp.

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
Let's go.

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,080
Damn.

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
She's really gone.

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
And she's gone with my gun.

60
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
Oh?

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,080
Damn, Siamese soldiers!

62
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
Aunt Eungpueng.

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,200
Where is Som Po?

64
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,960
She doesn't want to go.

65
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,240
How could she? How can I
go back to Laplae empty-handed?

66
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,120
Then, you can go back first.

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,160
I’ll use a tough approach
and take her back myself.

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Aunt,

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
please take care of Som Po.

70
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,880
Don’t let anything happen to her.

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
- Get out of the way.
- Chan.

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,480
There.

73
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,920
Hurry up.

74
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,560
Here.

75
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,720
This way.

76
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,680
Huh?

77
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,800
What's wrong?

78
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,320
Where is Kahla?

79
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,800
Do you know?

80
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
Aw?

81
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,520
Your friend has gone missing.
Aren’t you worried at all?

82
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,960
It should be alright.

83
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,160
She must have gone home.

84
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,160
Home?

85
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
By herself?

86
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,320
I don't know.

87
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
Did you two argue?

88
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,080
Well, never mind.

89
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,320
But I need to see Kahla now.

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
Can you help me?

91
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,880
If I never see Kahla again…

92
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,040
Could you bear

93
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,560
saying goodbye to Chan

94
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,640
and never seeing him again?

95
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Please, help me.

96
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,600
Show me the way to your town.

97
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
Wait.

98
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,680
Leave it to your fate.

99
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,160
I’m already burdened with heavy sins.

100
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,320
If I show you the Mist Gate
and you enter the town,

101
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,720
Goddess Som will curse me
with eternal damnation.

102
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,080
Hey, Som--

103
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,040
Som Po.

104
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
Damn.

105
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
The Mist Gate?

106
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,680
Chan.

107
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,440
How are you my son?

108
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm better now.

109
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,720
Devil Chan.

110
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,600
- Devil Chan.
- Som Po, how are you?

111
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,880
Are you alright?

112
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,160
Who is this woman? Get her out!

113
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
How could you let her hang around my son?

114
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,120
- Wait.
- Let go of me.

115
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,040
- She's my wife.
- Huh?

116
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,360
Huh?

117
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Let go of her.

118
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
Are you crazy?

119
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,840
Taking a wild girl
with no background as a wife?

120
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,960
I sent you to study and become a noble.

121
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,480
Why do you aim so low?

122
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,840
How would she have no background?

123
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,600
She’s a person just like us, with a family

124
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,160
and a town where she grew up.

125
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,480
Who is she?

126
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,800
She is from the Town of Mist.

127
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,520
There are many places out there

128
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,160
where the noble Bangkokians
have yet to reach.

129
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
Soldiers!

130
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,880
Capture this woman.

131
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,440
- Capture her.
- What?

132
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,360
Capture her.

133
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,960
- No.
- Come.

134
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,360
Why do you capture me?

135
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,320
Let go of her. Som Po.

136
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,880
I said let go of her.

137
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,920
Father!

138
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Som Po!

139
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
I can't take it anymore.

140
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,480
Just two more big pushes.

141
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
When will we arrive?

142
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm tired.

143
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,400
In the forest ahead,
someone will be waiting to take over.

144
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,160
Just a little further to go.

145
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,760
Being a laborer is already exhausting,

146
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,920
but being a rebel is even more difficult.

147
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,600
Just a little further.

148
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,520
- Go faster Songpeep
- I'm tired.

149
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,600
There are rebels.

150
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,080
And they are a large group.

151
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,760
Angkab is still alive.

152
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,360
This has never happened.

153
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,360
Ordinary people
wouldn't plan something this big.

154
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
Increase the patrol forces

155
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,200
throughout the area

156
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,200
and capture the suspects.

157
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes my Queen.

158
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,040
I'm too tired now.

159
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,840
Songpeep, pull harder.

160
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,520
Harder.

161
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,040
Pull.

162
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,520
Songpeep.

163
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,280
Pull.

164
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
It's stuck.

165
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,680
Alright, you pull, I’ll go lift it.

166
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
Alright.

167
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
It's not moving.

168
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
What’s it stuck on?

169
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
We'll help.

170
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,960
That's too slow. Lady Warden is coming.

171
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,400
- Lift it.
- Lift it.

172
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,440
Do you think it's the time for that?

173
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
Have some hot tea Mr. Chan.

174
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,680
- How is Som Po?
- Oh.

175
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,000
Did they do anything to her?

176
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,800
Calm down.

177
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,440
Well…

178
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,119
Som Po wasn’t imprisoned,
nor was she punished.

179
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Mr. Chan,

180
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,440
my heart almost jumped out of my chest,

181
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
thinking that

182
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,840
you would leave me behind.

183
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,680
Well, Som Po said

184
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,280
you were stabbed by a crazy woman?

185
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,200
Mr. Chan,

186
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,120
let's hurry back to Bangkok.

187
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,920
Am.

188
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,640
Come to think of it,

189
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,280
you and I have been playing
since we were kids.

190
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
- Ouch!
- Oh.

191
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
- I'm sorry.
- Be careful.

192
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,040
Well…

193
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,880
You've always treated me like a brother.

194
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
When we were kids,

195
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,920
I only had you

196
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,800
and my father.

197
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,800
Please don’t think I’m being intrusive,

198
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,680
but I’ve never seen your mother.

199
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,280
I don't know who my mother is either.

200
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,120
Well,

201
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,920
drink the hot tea.

202
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,040
You cursed woman, bringing ill fortune.

203
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,400
Take her out of my home.

204
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,840
Queen Bua, I apologize.

205
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,800
Get her out of my sight
to the fields and farms.

206
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,840
I apologize Queen Bua.

207
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,400
‪No!

208
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
No!

209
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,040
I didn't do anything wrong.
Please spare me.

210
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,280
Please don't make me do
such degrading work.

211
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,720
I don't want to.

212
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,400
No.

213
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,440
Are you from the Town of Mist?

214
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,520
Barbarian.

215
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,880
Savage.

216
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440
Mist Demon.

217
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Excuse me Luang Mitr.

218
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
There is a telegram from Bangkok
about a plan adjustment.

219
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
We would like you to consider it

220
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,000
to prepare for the upcoming march Sir.

221
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,440
Don’t think I’ll ever accept you.

222
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,360
I don’t want my son
to face a terrible fate from

223
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,160
a barbarian woman in that Town of Mist.

224
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,440
Wait.

225
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,000
Please let me see Chan.

226
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,080
If we move there,

227
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,880
here.

228
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,440
The Ngiao forces
are splitting into groups.

229
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,920
One is attacking Lampang,

230
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,440
while another might be
heading toward other towns.

231
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,000
We need to move faster Sir.

232
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,240
Have the telegrams been sent
to all the towns in Lanna yet?

233
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,880
The authorities in every town have
been informed and are on high alert Sir.

234
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,640
These Ngiao are under British control.

235
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,640
It might not just be the British.

236
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,600
The local rulers here
can’t be fully trusted either.

237
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
Some might be playing both sides.

238
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,400
If that's the case,

239
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,240
we are the ones to lose much more.

240
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,120
Split our forces in two,

241
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,320
one group

242
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,000
to Phrae,

243
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,840
and the other

244
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,720
to spy on the British.

245
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,440
See if they are secretly aiding the Ngiao.

246
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,680
Yes Sir.

247
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Chan.

248
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,720
Som Po.

249
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,760
How are you?

250
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm so happy.

251
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,640
I was so worried.

252
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
I thought you wouldn't wake up.

253
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I won't die easily.

254
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,920
I have to…

255
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,760
wait and see our baby first.

256
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,920
I intended to stay here

257
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,320
until I was sure you were safe.

258
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,680
Now that I’m certain you’re safe,

259
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,760
it’s time for me to…

260
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
We’re about to move the army forward,

261
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,360
but your condition is still concerning

262
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,080
and should remain under
the care of the army’s doctor.

263
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,800
You will have to travel with the army,

264
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
and we’ll figure things out later.

265
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,720
As for you,

266
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,160
come along.

267
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,600
Hey you, why are you so slow?

268
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,720
I’ve been waiting for fertilizer

269
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,880
so long my back is burnt.

270
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,320
You are annoying.

271
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,280
My back is burnt, and I’m in pain too.

272
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,760
Watch your mouth.

273
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,680
No wonder the Queen kicked you out.

274
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,440
This is what someone out of
favor looks like.

275
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,000
Chaba.

276
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,080
Yeehub.

277
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,280
Why are you here?

278
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,320
Everyone else has gone home.

279
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,320
Where are you staying tonight?

280
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,080
My place was at the Queen's home.

281
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,360
So I don't have anywhere to go.

282
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,360
I have a place for you to stay.

283
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,720
Really?

284
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
Som Po.

285
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,720
Som Po.

286
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,000
Kahla.

287
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,200
Back off.

288
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,320
Find the moment to get up,
and establish your position.

289
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
I will focus on training harder.

290
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Everyone.

291
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,600
Why did you bring Yeehub?

292
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,080
Calm down.

293
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,520
Yeehub was expelled from the Queen's house
and has become a laborer now.

294
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,520
She knows a lot about Bua.

295
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,920
She'll be able to help us.

296
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,320
Who would believe her?

297
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,200
Try betraying her.

298
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,680
I made only a small mistake,

299
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,840
yet she hurt me

300
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,080
and sent me to be a laborer,

301
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,080
without any regard

302
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,680
for how much

303
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,640
I have dedicated myself

304
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,880
to serving her

305
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,280
and remained loyal all this time.

306
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,600
I’ve seen plenty of tears,

307
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,440
but they don’t reveal any truth.

308
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,320
I’ve served closely
by her side for many years.

309
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
I believe

310
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,320
I know her true nature more than anyone.

311
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,400
How can we trust you?

312
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,720
Let me prove my loyalty.

313
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,720
Everyone, guard the barn carefully.

314
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,520
If anything goes wrong,
all of Laplae will face starvation.

315
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,280
Do you understand?

316
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,320
<i>From evening until late at night,</i>

317
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,080
<i>Lady Warden Pudson</i>
<i>will station guards around the barn.</i>

318
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,840
However, come the deep night,

319
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,440
<i>Lady Warden Pudson</i>
<i>will gather all her forces</i>

320
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,720
<i>to assign tasks for the next day.</i>

321
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,000
This is something everyone knows.

322
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,360
Why are you bringing it up?

323
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,480
I heard the Queen
and Lady Warden Pudson say that

324
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,600
this year’s rice harvest isn’t much,

325
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,080
so be extra careful to prevent any fires.

326
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,080
If a fire does break out,

327
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,640
quickly rally everyone to put it out.

328
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,120
What exactly are you telling us to do?

329
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,040
Burn the barn.

330
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,840
If you don’t want to die, keep quiet.

331
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
Make sure to check thoroughly.

332
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,240
Don’t let any rice
or vegetables be stolen like before.

333
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,480
If you find any women acting suspiciously,

334
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,120
bring them to me immediately.

335
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,320
Lady Pudson. Lady Pudson, there’s a fire!

336
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,440
- Where?
- The barn.

337
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,120
The rebels are burning down our barn.

338
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,160
Hurry! Get water to put out the fire!

339
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Go get water!

340
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,680
Not enough!

341
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,760
On the right!

342
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,800
Get more water.

343
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,320
Setting the barn on fire
is actually a ploy

344
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,120
to draw Pudson’s forces
to extinguish the fire.

345
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

346
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,080
we’ll raid the armory.

347
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,520
Lady Guardian.

348
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,040
This is important.

349
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
I'll lead it myself.

350
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Everyone, the barn is on fire.

351
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,760
Lady Warden orders us to help now!

352
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,360
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

353
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,240
Go take all the weapons.

354
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,120
Hurry up. Let's go.

355
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,640
‪-Go.
‪-Hurry up.

356
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,880
Lady Guardian Angkab.

357
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,920
The scheme was to burn the barn,

358
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,800
but the real target
was to loot the armory?

359
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,760
My Queen, it was my fault.

360
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,680
I apologize.

361
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,120
Angkab.

362
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,240
Count how many swords we have.

363
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,000
Count how many we have.

364
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,000
Thank you.

365
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,680
I have to thank you for helping us today.

366
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,800
Let me join you.

367
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
We'll make Laplae a better place.

368
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,920
Use the knowledge you possess

369
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,960
to bring down Queen Bua,

370
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,600
for the sake of our Laplae.

371
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,840
Kahla.

372
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
Kahla.

373
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,720
You're back. Are you pregnant?

374
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,520
I'm really glad.
You were gone longer than the other women,

375
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
I thought you might not return.

376
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
And where is Som Po?

377
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,600
I came alone.

378
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,320
Seeing you reminds me so much
of Lady Guardian Angkab.

379
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,560
Did my mother pass away?

380
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,760
Lady Guardian Angkab
secretly left the town.

381
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,600
So Goddess Som punished her.

382
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,280
There must be a reason
my mother left Laplae.

383
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,080
The Queen only announced that
Lady Guardian broke the rule.

384
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,600
I need to go and ask the Queen.

385
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,920
You can't.

386
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,720
Laplae is in chaos now.
The barn is on fire.

387
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,680
You shouldn’t add to the Queen’s worries.

388
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,080
Besides, according to tradition,

389
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,840
returning devil-hunters
need to go to Lady Pua's house

390
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,320
to drink the purifying antidote.

391
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,920
I can't forget now.

392
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,120
I need to find the truth
about my mother first.

393
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,920
Don't make us hurt you.

394
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,080
What are you bringing back?

395
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,760
Don't you know the truth?

396
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,760
No outside items are allowed into Laplae.

397
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,040
Don't make me hurt you.

398
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,960
Back off.

399
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,040
What was that sound?

400
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,120
What is that Kahla?

401
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,800
I told you that I can't forget now

402
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,960
and no one can know
that I'm already back in Laplae.

403
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,880
NEXT EPISODE

404
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,040
Wait. It's me.

405
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,440
We need to get Kahla
before her mother does.

406
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,480
Send a guard to watch over this house

407
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,880
and find Kahla.

408
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,160
<i>I have to return to where I came from.</i>

409
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,680
What exactly do you want from me?

410
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,880
Som Po.

411
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,400
