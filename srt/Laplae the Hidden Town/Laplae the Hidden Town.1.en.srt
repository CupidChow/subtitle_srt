00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,320
<i>Travel Diary</i>
<i>of Exploring the Railway Route,</i>

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,960
<i>Lampang to Mawlamyine.</i>

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,520
<i>It's been three months</i>
<i>since I departed from Bangkok.</i>

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,640
<i>The journey my father didn't wish for.</i>

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,720
<i>He would probably label me</i>

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,960
<i>a rebel, accusing me</i>
<i>of conspiring with the British.</i>

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,680
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,920
<i>the railway enterprise</i>
<i>will bring something new to Siam,</i>

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,360
<i>taking people</i>
<i>from the plains to the highlands</i>

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,479
<i>and leading those in the valleys</i>
<i>to see the wider world.</i>

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
<i>Beyond this valley</i>
<i>lies a town shrouded in mist,</i>

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,280
<i>a town inhabited solely by women.</i>

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,360
<i>However, no one can confirm</i>

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,640
<i>its existence.</i>

15
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,040
Look, the Queen remains still,

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
just as she did last night.

17
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
I apologize.

18
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
I felt worried,

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,320
so I asked Lady Warden Pudson
to come and check.

20
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
You troubled Lady Warden Pudson.

21
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
I apologize.

22
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,520
Now that you're here,

23
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,480
I would like to consult with you
regarding the devil-hunting ceremony.

24
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,240
I would be glad to help.

25
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,360
However, Lady Guardian Angkab
is still at the misty edge.

26
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
<i>I think</i>

27
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,680
<i>we should wait for her return first.</i>

28
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,480
Ladies, please hurry up.

29
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,880
After this, we must go to
the southern misty edge.

30
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,800
Set traps for the animals
in every direction.

31
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,280
Do not let them enter the hidden town
and harm any Laplae ladies.

32
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Lady Guardian. Lady Guardian Angkab.

33
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
There's a dangerous animal this way.

34
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
Lady Guardian Angkab.

35
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
Ladies, get ready.

36
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
Stop.

37
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,760
I apologize.

38
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,840
I thought it was a dangerous animal.

39
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,560
It's not dead yet.

40
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
I will take it for treatment.

41
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,040
Goddess Som was merciful,
so it is not serious.

42
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,560
Let it rest for two days
and it should be fully recovered.

43
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,160
Thank you for saving its life.

44
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,360
Please thank Goddess Som
for not taking its life.

45
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,120
I merely sustain its life

46
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
as Goddess Som's wish.

47
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
Here they come.

48
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
- I bow to you Lady Bua.
- I bow to you Lady Bua.

49
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm pleased that we are all here today.

50
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
Lady Warden Pudson.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,720
Lady Healer Bunnag.

52
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Lady Guardian Angkab.

53
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,480
You're back in town to speak with me.

54
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,720
You sought my presence.

55
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,280
I had to come.

56
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
Is there something urgent?

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,880
You must have been at the misty edge
so long that you lost track of time.

58
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
It's the eighth month. It is time
for the devil-hunting ceremony.

59
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,840
Indeed, a year has passed.

60
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
Time does fly.

61
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,200
I still recall
the day you assumed your position.

62
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,480
You held the baby girl against your chest,

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,480
then took your place on the throne.

64
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,120
I thank all of you

65
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,960
who helped me,

66
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,480
allowing me to become the queen
peacefully and smoothly.

67
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,800
Now, it's time for the new queen.

68
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,760
This year, there are 20 women
who have had their periods

69
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,240
for a total of 60 cycles and are eligible
for devil-hunter selection.

70
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,040
Two of them are Som Po,

71
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,520
the daughter of Queen Bua,

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
and Kahla,
the daughter of Lady Guardian Angkab.

73
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,440
Som Po has been nurtured by you,

74
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,200
she is bound to become Queen.

75
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,480
It's going to be good for Laplae.

76
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,080
I feel sorry for Som Po.

77
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,680
She can’t seem to do anything right.

78
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,600
I’m not sure if she’ll be selected.

79
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,240
I’ll have to place my hopes on Kahla

80
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,960
to assume the position instead.

81
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
Scrub it.

82
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
Swing it. Scrub it.

83
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
Kahla.

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,360
What are you doing here?

85
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,800
The women of your age group
have completed their training

86
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,960
and no longer need to come here.

87
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Go back home, prepare yourself,
and stay at the training house

88
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,840
to wait for
the devil-hunter selection day.

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,800
I bow to you Teacher.

90
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,360
I've finished packing my belongings,
but I couldn't find Som Po.

91
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,160
So I have not yet gone home.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,320
You two are inseparable.

93
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
If she isn't home,

94
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,520
she must be at her usual place.

95
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,640
I bow to you Teacher.

96
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,600
Aw, keep swinging it in the water.

97
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,480
Keep scrubbing it.

98
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,400
Here you are.

99
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,000
Kahla, why did you sneak up
without making a sound?

100
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,960
You startled me.

101
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,400
You startled me too.

102
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,920
You vanished from the training house
without a word.

103
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,800
I thought you were angry with me
and had already run back home.

104
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,080
But what is this?

105
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,360
You came back playing with dirt and mud,
and now your face is all dirty.

106
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,840
What do you mean
playing with dirt and mud?

107
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm gathering some herbs
to prepare medicine.

108
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
If anyone hears this,

109
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,440
they will think

110
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,400
you are the child of Healer Boonnak,

111
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
not the daughter of Queen Bua.

112
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,560
Nowadays,

113
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,280
no one thinks
I'm the queen's daughter anyway.

114
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
You resemble the queen's daughter
more than I do.

115
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,680
I know it now.

116
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,720
It's me.

117
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,120
I'm the queen's daughter,

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,400
but I was switched to become
the child of Lady Guardian.

119
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,400
Som Po.

120
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,840
Wait.

121
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,640
Som Po, I was just kidding.

122
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,440
Kahla.

123
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,080
Don't kill it.

124
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,680
It's a Golden Tree Snake.

125
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,520
It poses no danger.

126
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,560
But if you kill it,

127
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,080
you'll face a death sentence.

128
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,080
It's not worth it.

129
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,200
I feared it would harm you.

130
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
But,

131
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,800
If I have to die protecting you,

132
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,320
I have no fear.

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,480
Stop kidding.

134
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,000
Didn't you say it's not venomous?

135
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,960
It's mildly venomous, not deadly.

136
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,960
But better safe than sorry.

137
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,040
I don't think that's the case.

138
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,080
You simply want to play doctor

139
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,200
and make me the patient.

140
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,440
Since you know so much,

141
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,080
I’ll squeeze a lot of lime juice
to make your wound sting.

142
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,760
Laplae ladies, please listen.
I have an important matter to announce.

143
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,560
Through Goddess Som’s benevolence,

144
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,280
we have been blessed
with a bountiful harvest this year.

145
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,280
Queen Bua

146
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,600
has decided
to allocate more to each household.

147
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,800
Each artisan’s household

148
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,960
will receive an additional
five coconut shells of rice.

149
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,800
And each Laplae woman laborer

150
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,520
will receive an additional

151
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,640
two coconut shells of rice.

152
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,600
Thank you.

153
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,440
This allocation of rice

154
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,600
is not a blessing or favor
for which I should be thanked.

155
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,280
Rather, it is
the benevolence of Goddess Som,

156
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,160
who has been protecting
and caring for Laplae

157
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,200
since ancient times.

158
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,280
When all the Laplae ladies

159
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,440
behave virtuously,

160
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,520
avoiding deceit, killing,

161
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
and immoral acts,

162
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,080
Goddess Som bestows her kindness upon us.

163
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,960
Let all the Laplae women join together

164
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,360
in bowing to Goddess Som in gratitude.

165
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,040
I bow to you.

166
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
I bow to you.

167
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,800
On the forthcoming full moon night,

168
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
the devil-hunting ceremony will begin.

169
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,800
This time,

170
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,400
my daughter,

171
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,120
having completed 60 menstrual cycles,

172
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,840
is eligible to be a devil-hunter.

173
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,800
- Really?
- Yes.

174
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,040
Therefore,

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,720
my time as the Queen of the Town

176
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,200
will soon come to an end.

177
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,760
- Oh.
- I would like her

178
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,200
- to continue reigning.
- Yes.

179
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,480
Ladies who have completed
a total of 60 menstrual cycles,

180
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,760
please prepare
for the devil-hunter selection ceremony.

181
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
The devil-hunter

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,200
whose daughter is the most virtuous

183
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,720
will become the next Queen of the Town.

184
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
I think…

185
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,760
From what I see, Kahla’s appearance
is radiant and virtuous.

186
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,680
She would make
a suitable Queen of the Town.

187
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,720
Yes, I agree.

188
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
- Right?
- Yes.

189
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,160
You're fortunate
it wasn't a venomous snake.

190
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
You couldn't avoid it and got bitten.

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,640
This signifies that
you did not train hard enough.

192
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,440
You're not fast enough.

193
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,360
If you're going for the devil-hunting,

194
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,200
how can you survive?

195
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,320
Don't worry Mother.

196
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,720
If I enter the devil-hunter training,

197
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,880
I will train hard.

198
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,880
When you went for the devil-hunting,

199
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,120
were you afraid?

200
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,160
Was I afraid?

201
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,760
I can't recall.

202
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,760
But I do remember

203
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,839
feeling uneasy about something.

204
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,720
So,

205
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,160
you have to be prepared.

206
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,280
I won't disappoint you Mother.

207
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,720
My daughter, once you have bathed
and powdered yourself,

208
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,360
you're as lovely as any other lady.

209
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,600
I don't take care of myself.

210
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,320
I embarrass you.

211
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,080
I apologize.

212
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,520
I’ve been so occupied
with my duties as Queen

213
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,040
that I haven’t had time to be a mother.

214
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
So, you have been neglected

215
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,880
and are not as well cared for
as other ladies.

216
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,360
I also apologize.

217
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,440
No, you've taught me very well.

218
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,440
If you say so, that eases my mind.

219
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,720
I’ve always thought

220
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,280
it was my own shortcomings

221
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,560
that led you

222
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,320
to seek remedies to heal others,

223
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,840
instead of focusing on training
in other areas

224
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,960
to become a suitable Queen of the Town.

225
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,960
Our lineage

226
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,080
has held the Queen position
for six generations,

227
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,200
beginning with Queen Pathum,

228
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,320
Queen Ubon,

229
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,520
Queen Busakorn,

230
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Queen Bua,

231
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
and now you.

232
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,600
If I do not become a devil-hunter…

233
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,040
- If I cannot do it--
- You must succeed,

234
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,880
just as our foremothers did.

235
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,400
The rice, flowers,

236
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,760
and offerings for Goddess Som are ready.

237
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,400
When you enter the special training
at the hunter’s training house,

238
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,800
you must show your determination

239
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
to Goddess Som.

240
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
I will be here to support you.

241
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,880
What's on your mind Som Po?

242
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,800
If I don't pass
the devil-hunter selection,

243
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,480
I'm going to die for sure.

244
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,320
You won't. I didn't pass either.

245
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,520
You were Teacher's daughter.

246
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,280
But…

247
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,720
Since Goddess Som has determined

248
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,880
that any woman who fails
the devil-hunter selection

249
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,040
or passes, but does not bear a daughter

250
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,000
must step down to become a laborer,

251
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,080
I must humbly accept this rule.

252
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,400
Keep your chin up Som Po.

253
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,240
There are still many days left
until the devil-hunter selection day.

254
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,560
You still have time to prepare.

255
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,560
Yeehub said that
the selection process is very difficult.

256
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,240
What I know, is that

257
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,600
there are tests of dancing,

258
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,240
walking,

259
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,160
fighting,

260
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
and lady’s etiquette.

261
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,520
If it's about dancing or fighting,

262
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,280
I can help you.

263
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,760
Remember what you said.

264
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,680
Alright.

265
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,480
You never listened to me.
You are incredibly foolish.

266
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,240
I apologize.

267
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,360
I didn't mean to do it.

268
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,160
You're not paying attention.
My belongings are damaged.

269
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,840
Stop. You can't do this.

270
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,440
Why not? She is a laborer in my household.

271
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,000
If she doesn’t follow orders, as a master
I have the right to punish her.

272
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Step away.

273
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,320
If you beat a laborer woman
until she bleeds,

274
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
you will face the same punishment.
Don’t you know that?

275
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,240
The whipping has already left marks.

276
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
One more stroke, and there will be blood.

277
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,600
Help me.

278
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
Go ahead.

279
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,640
Do it. Whip her.

280
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
You will bleed just as she does.

281
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
Go ahead. Hit her.

282
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,840
Get inside and do your work.

283
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,040
And don't ever make mistakes again.

284
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,200
I don't like this.

285
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,600
How can we let a laborer lady
get punished mercilessly.

286
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,680
I feel bad for her.

287
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,360
Som Po,

288
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,560
if you get to be Queen,

289
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
change this rule.

290
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,640
I must first become a devil-hunter.

291
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,840
You can do it.

292
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,120
A devil?

293
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,040
Who was that?

294
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,720
Since this year

295
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,280
my daughter

296
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,160
is participating in the selection,

297
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,280
so,

298
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,600
I will not involve myself
in any part of the process.

299
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,560
Let all the women rest assured.

300
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,400
Thank you Queen Bua.

301
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,880
- Thank you.
- We're so fortunate.

302
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,200
Yes.

303
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,320
<i>Before the devil-hunter</i>
<i>selection ceremony starts,</i>

304
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,320
<i>you will be secluded</i>
<i>in the devil-hunter training house</i>

305
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,440
<i>to review</i>

306
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,560
<i>what we have learned about the devils.</i>

307
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,840
Be careful. Don't go too deep.

308
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,560
Help each other scrub your backs…
watch out!

309
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,960
Be careful.

310
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,320
What if you get hurt?

311
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,960
I'll lead the way.

312
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,600
Follow me. Walk carefully.

313
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,240
You seem distracted.

314
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,240
Did you have a nightmare?

315
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,120
I apologize.

316
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,760
The steam from the hot spring
reminds me of the dream I had.

317
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,320
I saw a devil in my dream.

318
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,800
What? You dreamt of a devil?

319
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,480
Not so loud.

320
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
You've never seen a devil,

321
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,920
yet you dreamt of one.

322
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,800
I don't understand either.

323
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,360
Well,

324
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
is a devil

325
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,200
as terrifying

326
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,920
as Teacher described?

327
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,840
Som Po, why are we in the woods?

328
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,240
I can train you at home.

329
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,600
I‘d rather not. I’m embarrassed
in front of the other women.

330
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,960
It's better in the woods.

331
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,200
Examine its color first

332
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,200
and wash it slowly.

333
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,320
Talom,

334
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,360
why the haste?

335
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,480
Did you examine the color thoroughly?

336
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,080
I did. It's a vivid red.

337
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,840
But I don't like blood.

338
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,120
I felt like fainting, so I washed it fast.

339
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
I apologize Teacher.

340
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,720
How could you faint?

341
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,920
- It's yours.
- That girl is just as I was.

342
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,200
I did everything wrong.

343
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,960
Unlike you, who's good at everything.

344
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,280
You don't need a test.

345
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,760
You will become a devil-hunter regardless.

346
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,040
When we were kids, we helped each other.

347
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,800
Now, we also have to help each other

348
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,560
to become devil-hunters

349
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
and cut the devil's Ding-Dong.

350
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,040
The appearance of devils
is similar to ours.

351
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,880
They have eyes, ears, nose, and mouth
just like any woman.

352
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,000
But the most wicked thing
about the devils is…

353
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,600
they have a Ding-Dong.

354
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,800
Teacher,

355
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,720
If we remove the Ding-Dong
from the devils,

356
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,440
will they become better?

357
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
Yes.

358
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,560
Can we cut it with a knife?

359
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,720
Yes, or if we use a crossbow

360
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,000
to shoot the Ding-Dong, will it fall off?

361
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,520
- Yes, cut it.
- Whoa!

362
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
The Ding-Dong isn’t like a longan.

363
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,840
How can you cut it easily?

364
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,160
They're going to fight.

365
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,840
They're not going to
stay still for us to cut it.

366
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Whoa.

367
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Train me.

368
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,400
I need to pass the selection.

369
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,600
Som Po, you asked me
to teach you how to dance.

370
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,240
Why are you gathering these leaves?

371
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,040
Let me collect a few of them,
then I'll practice dancing.

372
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
The Lady Healer gives this aromatic root

373
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,080
to the devil-hunters every year.

374
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,800
- Don't you remember it?
- Of course I do not.

375
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,920
All these plants appear the same.

376
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
That's ridiculous.

377
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,000
What is that?

378
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,480
A feather?

379
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,120
Any injured sparrows around here?

380
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,440
Som Po, come here.

381
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,760
Som Po.

382
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,920
Wake up little bird.

383
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,960
It's too late Som Po.

384
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,160
That can't be. I have to help it.

385
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,400
Som Po.

386
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,640
It's determined by Goddess Som.

387
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,280
She has taken it.

388
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,680
That's not right.

389
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,000
Goddess Som doesn't desire this.

390
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,240
Its life was taken away.

391
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Who dared to do this?

392
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,840
What exactly is happening?

393
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,680
What are you doing?

394
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,760
Did you kill the bird?

395
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,400
Taking a life
is a grave offense in Laplae.

396
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,680
It violates all rules and customs.

397
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,640
I have instructed the guards

398
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,640
to set the animal traps as you directed.

399
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,400
Thank you Lady Guardian,

400
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,800
for adhering to the rule
of not taking animal lives,

401
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,480
as decreed by Goddess Som.

402
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,520
With the animals falling into the traps,

403
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,760
I need more healing units

404
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
to save their lives.

405
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,800
Excuse me Queen Bua.
Lady Warden and Lady Healer are coming.

406
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,560
My Queen.

407
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,360
The bird was killed.

408
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,920
There are many dead birds.
Someone has killed them.

409
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,840
Goddess Som must be displeased with this.

410
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,880
Goddess Som.

411
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,960
Goddess Som.

412
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,159
The spirit of Goddess Som
has possessed the Queen.

413
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,320
You…

414
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,560
You…

415
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,239
There will be

416
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,880
a disaster in Laplae

417
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,920
because some ruthless people

418
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,520
have slain my children.

419
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,280
If the perpetrator does not repent,

420
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,440
the town will be destroyed,

421
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
and Laplae will be ruined.

422
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,840
It will suffer calamities
and death in all forms,

423
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,200
on land,

424
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,400
in water, in the wind,
in fire, and in the mist.

425
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,440
Both she and her mother committed this sin

426
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,680
and will face utter ruin.

427
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,200
There will be no paradise for them
in the next life.

428
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,280
Talom.

429
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,880
Talom.

430
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,120
Catch her.

431
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,320
Talom.

432
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,360
Talom. My daughter.

433
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,360
Wait for me.

434
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,360
Talom, calm down.

435
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,520
Don't get close.

436
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,280
No.

437
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,680
No.

438
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
No.

439
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,960
Don't worry.

440
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,400
Let go of my daughter.

441
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,160
Let go of my daughter.

442
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,920
<i>If I didn’t have my period,</i>

443
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,080
would I have to carry feces
and urine like the laborer ladies?

444
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,400
Talom.

445
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,400
Mother.

446
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,160
Where's the cloth?

447
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,160
Keep this. Don't let anyone see it.

448
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,600
Return to the training house.
I'll bring more blood next month.

449
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,040
Alright.

450
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,640
That's the girl I said
always got scolded as I did.

451
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
I searched Talom's bed

452
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,800
and found the blood-soaked cloth
and this bottle.

453
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,000
It is certainly bird’s blood.

454
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,160
What shall I do

455
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,760
with these two sinners?

456
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,360
You lied about having your period.

457
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,680
And you,

458
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,760
you have taken the lives of the birds.

459
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,800
Your behavior is unsuitable

460
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,880
for living in this paradise.

461
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,720
- Cut their tongues.
- Cut their tongues.

462
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,880
- Cut their tongues.
- Cut their tongues.

463
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,640
- Cut their tongues.
- Cut their tongues.

464
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,800
Get away.

465
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,240
Kick us out.

466
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,360
My daughter and I

467
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,120
don't want to be in this town anymore.

468
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,120
Back off.

469
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,840
Back off.

470
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,440
Stay away, all of you.

471
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,600
Don't come closer.

472
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,760
Don't come closer.

473
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,920
Back off.

474
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,520
Don't come closer.

475
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,920
Where are you going to live?

476
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,000
There are a lot of bad people outside.

477
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,200
How can you live there?

478
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Back off.

479
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Don't come closer.

480
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,720
Don't come closer.

481
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,480
Your wrongdoing

482
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,280
will be judged by Goddess Som.

483
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,560
Mother.

484
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,720
I bow to you, Goddess Som.

485
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,480
Now,

486
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,080
you both

487
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,480
return to Goddess Som.

488
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,960
May your spirits

489
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,000
rest in peace.

490
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,120
<i>This is the position that offers you</i>

491
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,560
<i>the best chance to have a daughter.</i>

492
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,200
Wow.

493
