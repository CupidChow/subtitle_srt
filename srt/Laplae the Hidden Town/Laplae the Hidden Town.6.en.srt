1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,960
THIS DRAMA IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,800
CHARACTERS, PLACES
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,920
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED
FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Arrest her.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,840
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,480
Why did you break the rule?

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,560
Anchan, my sister.

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Eighteen years ago,
what exactly happened to her?

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
I'm really trying to help us.

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,160
Then prove it.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,120
<i>All these women have gold with them?</i>

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,840
Are you pregnant?

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
How about you Kahla? Are you pregnant?

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,159
The Queen played the flute

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
after the Mist Demon appeared?

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,120
<i>But that day, I heard the flute</i>

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,480
<i>before the Mist Demon appeared.</i>

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,720
When will Som Po come back home?

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880
I feel like it's been a long time.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,600
- Yeehub.
- Yes my Queen?

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Do you know how far along
Lady Healer Boonnak is

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,440
in preparing the purifying antidote?

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,720
She's finished it.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,880
It's ready
for the returning devil-hunters.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,680
In that case,
please go and get some for me.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,080
What do you need it for?

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,680
Yes my Queen.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,240
My Queen.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,640
I have good news.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
Our devil-hunter
has given birth to a daughter.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,840
That's good.

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,760
How many ladies are still pregnant?

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Goya is the only one left.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,520
Oh, push a little more.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,520
- She is expected to give birth tonight.
- It's coming.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,640
Push.

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,160
Keep pushing.

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,360
Push.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
Oh, the head is coming out.

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,840
It's coming. Push more.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,240
It's coming.

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,640
It's coming.

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
It's coming.

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,840
Lady Healer.

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,920
How is my baby?

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Give me my child.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
- Where are you taking my child?
- Calm down.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Where are you taking my child?

49
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,400
- Give me my child.
- Calm down Goya.

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,600
Give me my child.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,840
Why are you taking my child?

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,800
My daughter.

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,000
- Goya, calm down.
- Lady Healer.

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,680
- Listen.
- Where is my child?

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
Listen to me.

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,960
You’ve given birth to a devil.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
I'm sorry about that.

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,760
- That's not true.
- I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,440
- Calm down.
- Please let me see my daughter!

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,360
Goya, rest now.

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,880
That's not true, right?

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,840
I need to see my child.

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,600
Goya.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,760
Be prepared to be a laborer.

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,920
Goya, you need to rest.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,920
My child…

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Be careful.

68
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,480
Watch your step.

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,760
Be careful with the baby.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,280
Be careful.

71
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
We’ll go now.

72
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,320
You and Som Po, hurry up and get pregnant.

73
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,520
If you're too late, when you reach home,

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,720
I may have taken the queen position.

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,520
Don't forget the golden turmeric.

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,880
I won't forget. Let's go.

77
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
I can't wait to go home.

78
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,000
You left without a word.

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
I've been looking for you.

80
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,000
You stole my golden turmeric
and still have the nerve to show up?

81
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,600
I just heard it.

82
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,240
You need to get pregnant, right?

83
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
It's not your business.

84
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,480
I'll help you get pregnant

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,400
in exchange for…

86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,520
your gold.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,040
Don’t even think about it.

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,200
I have what you want
and you have what I want.

89
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,880
We’re just trading.

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
Wait.

91
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,960
Don't go yet.

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
All your friends
have the same gold you have.

93
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,840
It means there is
a lot of gold like this in your town.

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
If you don't give it to me,

95
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,680
I'll find a way to get more of it.

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,120
To get more of it?

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,160
What do you mean?

98
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,520
Do you have more of it?

99
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,560
The golden turmeric my friend lost,

100
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
you stole it, didn't you?

101
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,240
No, I didn't steal it.

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,800
I found it. Your friend dropped it.

103
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,920
Will you hand it over nicely?

104
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,320
Oh, dear.

105
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,360
What can you do to a man like me?

106
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,040
I'll cut your Ding-Dong.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
Ding-Dong?

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,280
Hey. Don't do that.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,280
Don't do that. Calm down.

110
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,080
Stop.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Devil, your Ding-Dong.

112
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,680
Please don't.

113
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Please don't. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,400
I give up.

115
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
If I see you again,

116
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,240
I'll kill you.

117
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright. You won't see me again.

118
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,600
Ouch.

119
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,480
Jai.

120
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,760
What happened?

121
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Sit down.

122
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
The Siamese took our people.

123
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
- Come with me. Let's help them.
- Huh?

124
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,520
Jai, sit down first.

125
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
You can't go like this.

126
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,520
What will you do?
Let them die without doing anything?

127
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,520
Come with me. Let's help them.
Come with me.

128
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Will you go like this?

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,400
Will you just let our friends die?
You coward.

130
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Jai.

131
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,480
Jai.

132
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
Calm down.

133
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Give me time.

134
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,760
Give me time. I'll find guns.

135
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,520
Then we'll go help them.

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,560
How are you?

137
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,120
What did your mother do to Anchan?

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,320
Why did she have you fake Anchan's body?

139
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,400
Tell me if you know it.

140
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
I know as much as everyone knows.

141
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,880
If I knew the truth,
I would have told you already.

142
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,000
But I know for sure
that Anchan is still alive.

143
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,520
Why did she forget…

144
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,200
The purifying antidote.

145
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,920
That's right. She must have
taken the purifying antidote.

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
But for what reason,

147
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,040
- or because of whom?
- Some things

148
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
are in the past, let them be.

149
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,480
Don’t dig up the reasons.

150
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,040
And why did Lady Bongkod lie that

151
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,600
she died while giving birth?

152
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,600
She lied to the whole town.

153
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,440
Why did she hide?

154
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
It must be a bad thing.

155
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,520
Don’t speak ill of my mother.

156
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,880
Anchan gave birth to a devil.

157
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,120
She might have been scared
to be demoted to a laborer.

158
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,400
That's why she betrayed us,

159
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,800
broke the rule and fled.

160
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
You're lying.

161
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,640
Are you sure?

162
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,120
With the guilt
and love Anchan felt for us,

163
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,840
she was ashamed.

164
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,360
So she drank the purifying antidote
to forget her sins

165
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,960
and escape the shadows of her past.

166
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
Sometimes,

167
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,640
forgetting can be a gift.

168
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,400
Some things,

169
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,800
if forgotten,

170
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,080
won’t cause you pain.

171
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
In this moment,

172
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,800
you must be furious
upon learning the truth.

173
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,080
You went outside the mist.

174
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,080
By rule,
you must drink the purifying antidote.

175
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
If the mist surrounds the city,

176
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,640
how did Som Po escape the beasts?

177
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,400
Or do they only harm outsiders?

178
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,280
What are you saying?

179
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
I'll go and rest.

180
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,400
Devil Chan.

181
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,960
Mr. Chan.

182
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,240
Mr. Chan.

183
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,120
- Mr. Chan.
- Devil Chan.

184
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,640
Perhaps

185
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,400
drinking the purifying antidote

186
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
to dispel misfortune

187
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,720
isn’t used to cleanse sins

188
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,680
but rather to cover up
the wicked deeds of some vile people.

189
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,960
The devil-hunters will return home soon.

190
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,720
Don't you want to see your child?

191
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,880
Drink the purifying antidote.

192
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,040
Bua,

193
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,400
are you really a good person?

194
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you hiding some bad deeds?

195
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,360
A liar with a crooked heart,

196
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,640
pretending to be innocent and virtuous.

197
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,800
You’ve made it this far
because of your deceit.

198
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,240
You asked for it.

199
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,840
There's an important matter

200
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,840
that we have to address together

201
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
about Lady Guardian.

202
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
Due to the negligence of Lady Guardian,

203
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,840
the Mist Demon wreaked havoc
and harmed the townspeople.

204
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,560
But that’s not all.

205
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,840
Sneaking out of the town
is a grave offense.

206
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,560
And she refused to drink
the purifying antidote

207
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,960
as required by our laws,
showing that she is deceitful

208
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,280
and disloyal to our land.

209
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,920
Therefore, tonight,

210
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,520
Lady Guardian will be
imprisoned in the town square.

211
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,280
Death sentence.

212
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,720
You need to let Goddess Som decide.

213
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,520
Big news.

214
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,800
- What is it?
- Big news.

215
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,720
The city council
plans to execute Lady Guardian.

216
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,440
We will follow the tradition

217
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,560
<i>of publicly shaming the offender.</i>

218
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
You must ensure order at the Misty Edge

219
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
and prevent anyone from defying
the authority of Goddess Som.

220
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,600
On your knees.

221
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,120
On your knees.

222
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,720
On your knees.

223
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,920
Are you trying to run away?

224
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,560
Gather all the people to the town square.

225
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,720
We will begin the sentencing now.

226
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
We arrived.

227
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,240
Hurry up.

228
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,800
Good news.

229
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,040
The devil-hunters have returned.

230
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,480
The devil-hunters have returned.

231
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,720
Let's go everyone.

232
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,200
Let's go.

233
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,120
Yay.

234
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,440
- Get up.
- Stop.

235
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,520
The devil-hunters have returned.

236
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,520
- I bow to you.
- I bow to you.

237
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,640
I haven't seen Som Po and Kahla.

238
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,120
Aren't they back yet?

239
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,600
Today is a big day, an auspicious day.

240
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,800
All the ladies

241
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,320
have returned home, and I am overjoyed.

242
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,200
Is there any day more magnificent,
more blessed than this?

243
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,960
I invite the Teacher

244
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,480
to perform pregnancy checks
as a blessing for our land.

245
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,840
The results are out.

246
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
They are all pregnant.

247
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,560
I bow to you.

248
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,200
I bow to you.

249
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,560
I bow to you.

250
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,280
I bow to you.

251
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm not pregnant yet.

252
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,080
But it's alright.

253
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,320
I have to wait for Som Po anyway.

254
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,880
It's been days now.
Som Po hasn't returned yet.

255
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Som Po.

256
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,880
She didn't listen to me. I told her
to copulate with any devils.

257
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,600
Why Devil Chan?

258
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,920
I'll find Som Po.

259
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,680
Everyone has already returned to Laplae.
We have to hurry.

260
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,560
Henry, why do you like trains?

261
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,360
I like the railway
because it just keeps going.

262
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,200
I thought your answer would be

263
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,240
because the railways connect people

264
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,720
from North to South,

265
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,040
or something like that.

266
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,720
No, that's your reason.

267
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,160
My reason is, that if I take the train

268
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,080
to the north

269
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,800
and along the way I meet a beautiful girl,

270
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,360
I’ll take her on the train with me,
heading north together.

271
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,120
You'll go with the beautiful girl?

272
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,880
That's right.

273
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,520
Okay.

274
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,480
Will you go with me?

275
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,120
What are you dreaming about?

276
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,040
Drink a little bit of this

277
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,960
and get some rest.

278
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
Or should I get out of here?

279
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,200
It's really dangerous as they say.

280
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
You know it's dangerous.

281
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
Then why are you here?

282
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,560
Excuse me, did you see a lady who
doesn't look like someone from this town?

283
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,680
She has a round face and big eyes.

284
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,840
Let me think.

285
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,320
- Thief.
- Thief.

286
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,720
- Thief.
- Thief.

287
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,200
- Thief.
- Thief.

288
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,320
- Get away.
- You!

289
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,920
Hey.

290
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
Hey, stop.

291
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
What?

292
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,280
Hey.

293
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,800
- Jai.
- Where have you been all day?

294
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,840
Where are the guns?

295
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,320
You still haven't fully recovered yet.
Eat something first.

296
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,120
They took my friends. I can't eat.

297
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,000
Just eat, trust me.

298
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,840
Jai, wait. What are you going to do?

299
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,440
I'll fight with my sword.
I don't need your gun.

300
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
If I wait, my friends will die.

301
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,680
Jai. Jai. Jai.

302
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,440
Wait for me.

303
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,520
Hey.

304
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,520
Please keep an eye on them. I'll be back.

305
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,040
Hey.

306
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
The Ngiao escaped.

307
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,600
Hey.

308
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,200
Hey, no!

309
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,880
Hey, go!

310
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,960
Go!

311
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,880
- Jai, enough.
- No! No!

312
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,840
- Jai, stop.
- No! No!

313
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,160
Jai, that's enough. Let's run.

314
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Hey.

315
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
Hurry up. Let's go now!

316
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,320
Let's go.

317
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,440
Jai.

318
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,840
Hurry up.

319
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
Let's go.

320
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,360
I'm sorry.

321
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,360
I'll go first.

322
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,720
I'm sorry about that.

323
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,160
Did you see it?

324
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
If I didn't go there,
my friends wouldn't have died.

325
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,640
Don't blame yourself.

326
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,880
I accept your deal.

327
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,000
I’ll give you a gold bar

328
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,560
if you can get me pregnant.

329
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,200
Did you get the gold?

330
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,400
I told you,

331
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,800
I have to wait until she gets pregnant
to get the gold.

332
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,040
Are you waiting for the Siamese
to kill us all?

333
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,960
Where are you going?

334
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,360
I'm tired of you.

335
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,960
It's just a gold bar. Why is it so hard?

336
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,640
Who said I want just a gold bar?

337
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,880
What do you mean?

338
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,520
To fight with the Siamese,

339
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,960
we need a lot of money.

340
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,360
So, one gold bar is not enough.

341
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,200
I'll follow her to Laplae.

342
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,680
Good.

343
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,240
Queen Bua.

344
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,880
Where is Som Po?

345
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,200
I asked the ladies.

346
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,440
They said Som Po hasn't found a devil.

347
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,560
And Kahla hasn't gotten pregnant yet.

348
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,720
Did Kahla copulate with a devil?

349
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,400
Yes.

350
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,360
Lady Guardian injured the guard.

351
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,800
She still hasn’t learned her lesson.

352
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,120
What are you going to do next my Queen?

353
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,600
No one wants to see
our land being unstable,

354
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,840
but this will be a significant change.

355
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,800
You have broken
the serious rule of our land

356
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,240
and must be punished.

357
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,840
From now on,

358
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,280
you are no longer our Lady Guardian.

359
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,800
You went out of the town,

360
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,160
plotting evil deeds.

361
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,800
You schemed
with your allies to secretly prepare

362
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,400
for your daughter

363
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,840
to seize the Queen position

364
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,040
unjustly.

365
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,120
Your serious actions angered Goddess Som,

366
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,160
causing her to send the Mist Demon
to harm people.

367
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,920
This crime is unforgivable.

368
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,520
Today, let us all pray together
to seek forgiveness from Goddess Som,

369
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,000
to show her that

370
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,960
we will not neglect the punishment
of those who commit evil,

371
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,000
and that we will never
follow the path of the wicked.

372

Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant,

373
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
in reverence.

374
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,640
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant,

375
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,320
in reverence.

376
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,840
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant…

00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,640
Lady Guardian Angkab.

00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,960
And from now on,

379
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,000
you will no longer be tainted

380
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,280
by the dreadful memories
from outside the town.

Whose blood is it?

383
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,400
If the devil-hunters
don’t return home within two months,

384
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,920
they will face the death penalty.

385
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,360
Som Po, I won’t let you
do as you please anymore.
