This must be the memory-restoring potion.

<i>Take as much golden turmeric as you wish.</i>

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,080
<i>Min, you need to run away now!</i>

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,080
<i>The situation is uncertain right now.</i>

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,720
I propose we give them all

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,200
the purifying antidote and exile them,

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,320
never to return.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,439
Som Po… My child…

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,160
This is your price to pay.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,600
qLet go of me!

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,120
qqIf I must leave Laplae,
I wish to leave with dignity.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,800
At least allow the maidens
to comb my hair,

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,800
so I may leave looking proper.

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,920
Min, how did you manage to get this much?

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I got it for you as promised.

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,280
- Hey.
- One single bar can buy several rifles.

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,520
- Is it all gold?
- Of course it is.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,480
That's good Min.

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,320
This will help a lot.

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,920
Hey, what are you two doing?

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,080
Siamese soldiers!

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,800
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
Go!

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,720
Let's go!

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
Hey Min, I'll get it.

30
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,840
Cha, let’s go first.

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,240
Hey!

32
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,520
So, you and I

33
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,840
went through all this danger
just to find a woman named Som Po?

34
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,280
Yes Sir. She is your wife

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,560
and pregnant with your child.

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,120
You intended to bring her back
to Phra Nakhon with you,

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,640
but she disappeared before you could.

38
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,840
As I recall, the government only recently
ordered us to move toward Phrae,

39
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,000
but you’re saying
we’ve been here for months already.

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,680
Why don’t I have any memory of that?

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,440
Perhaps you were ambushed by the Ngiao.

42
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,160
We found you unconscious

43
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,520
with no sign of the six soldiers
that accompanied you.

44
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,520
If it was the Ngiao,
they would’ve killed me by now.

45
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
There’s a village woman here
to see you Sir.

46
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,760
Who? Bring her in.

47
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
Bua?

48
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,080
Is your name Bua?

49
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
Father,

50
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,360
who is this woman?

51
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
I am your mother.

52
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,160
We met in Laplae.

53
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,360
What do you mean by that?

54
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,400
It’s been nearly twenty years,
and we’re only now meeting again?

55
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,600
You were both given
a memory-erasing potion.

56
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
I went through the same fate,

57
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,760
but I managed to recover my memories.

58
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,000
I found the antidote
in the pin in my hair.

59
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,880
I was just trying to satisfy my hunger,
so I took it all,

60
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,280
but instead,
my memories came flooding back.

61
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Alright.

62
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
The past is behind us now.

63
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,680
Now, father, mother, and child

64
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,480
are finally together.

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,080
Let’s go back to Phra Nakhon
and live as a family.

66
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
I cannot do that.

67
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
The people of Laplae are suffering.

68
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,360
The town is being controlled by rebels,

69
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,800
and they are likely harming many others.

70
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,920
I want to help them,

71
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,560
and I’m asking you

72
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,600
and your men for help as well.

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,960
Bring guns and explosives
to help fight these evil people.

74
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
Once a good leader
takes the position of Queen,

75
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,040
I will leave the town
and live with you and our child.

76
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,560
This golden turmeric
was taken from the Ngiao.

77
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,560
We heard they had stolen it
from the Town of Mist

78
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,360
to gather more weapons.

79
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
Mm.

80
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,120
If they managed to smuggle
the golden turmeric out,

81
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,040
someone inside must be helping them.

82
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,120
You’re saying the people in the town

83
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,520
are siding with the Ngiao?

84
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,320
It’s possible.

85
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,480
The golden turmeric is not only valuable,

86
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
but it can also
grant us entry into Laplae.

87
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,320
We need to eliminate the root cause.

88
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Gather all available troops in the area.

89
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,320
- We'll attack the town before sunset.
- Yes Sir.

90
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,640
Well, I have a question.

91
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,840
Do you know a woman named Som Po?

92
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,640
She’s in Laplae.

93
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,080
It seems that this mist comes from
the stream surrounding the town,

94
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,000
possibly due to some minerals in the water
mixing with the soil in this area,

95
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,520
causing a thick mist
to cover the surroundings.

96
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
So, it’s not because of some spirits
or deities creating it,

97
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,280
as the rumors say?

98
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,240
Give me the golden turmeric.

99
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
Why does golden turmeric
make the mist disperse?

100
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,880
I’m not sure either.

101
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,280
Prepare the weapons.

102
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,320
In this area, there are mist guards

103
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,880
ready to fight off outsiders
at any moment.

104
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
Alright.

105
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,160
Bua.

106
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,000
Everyone, prepare to defend!

107
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,800
Fire!

108
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,880
Go!

109
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,880
Eungpueng, run!

110
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,240
- Watch out!
- Fire!

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Hey!

112
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,400
Aunt Eungpueng!

113
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,640
Run! Bua brought devils
to invade the town.

114
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
Go now!

115
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,600
Hey, stop!

116
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,640
Wait a second. You go check over there.

117
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,760
I’ll take care of this.

118
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,600
- Kahla.
- Min.

119
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,080
There’s no time, follow me now.
This way, hurry.

120
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,640
The gunshots won't stop. What’s happening?

121
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,880
- Eungpueng.
- Lady Guardian.

122
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,480
- Lady Guardian.
- Eungpueng.

123
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,240
- Lady Guardian.
- Bua has invaded. She brought soldiers.

124
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,200
My Queen, run away!

125
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,520
How is this possible?
Bua has no memories left.

126
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,760
How did she come back?

127
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,320
- Lady Guardian.
- Eungpueng!

128
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,960
Eungpueng!

129
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,560
- Eungpueng!
- Lady Guardian!

130
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,160
We’ve captured them all.
Where should we imprison them?

131
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,600
You wanted power so badly
that you brought outsiders here

132
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,280
to slaughter your own people of Laplae?

133
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,000
It’s because of you
that all of this happened.

134
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,600
Goddess Som granted us prosperity
and peace for countless generations,

135
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,840
but filth like you ruined everything.

136
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,560
Your Goddess Som doesn’t exist.

137
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,880
- It's you, Bua.
- Stop talking!

138
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,240
You use virtue as an excuse.

139
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,680
I said stop!

140
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,400
But it’s all about power for you Bua!

141
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,560
Bua, stop!

142
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,200
My Queen!

143
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,480
My Queen!

144
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,640
- My Queen!
- Bua!

145
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,119
- My Queen!
- My Queen!

146
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,440
- My Queen!
- Bua, you brat!

147
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,280
You brat!

148
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,599
My Queen!

149
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,480
<i>Mother, I passed the test.</i>

150
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,440
<i>I won't disappoint you.</i>

151
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,360
Thank you all for helping me,

152
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
making me rule this town peacefully.

153
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,800
Bua, are you really a good person?

154
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,400
Let's go.

155
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,080
The turmeric fields you see here
are the ones we’ve been talking about.

156
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
These plants will give us
an endless supply of gold.

157
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,720
Send someone to inform the authorities
that we’ve found a gold source

158
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,760
and that they should survey this area
as soon as possible.

159
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Yes Sir.

160
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,320
Father,

161
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,560
will there be any disputes
if the authorities survey this area?

162
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,280
After all, this place already has a ruler.

163
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,880
This land belongs to Siam.

164
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,040
Therefore, this small town
has always been part of Siam.

165
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,160
If we don’t act now,

166
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,800
one day, another town leader
or foreigners might discover it.

167
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,960
When that time comes,

168
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,720
it will become a threat to Siam.

169
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,160
Oh, Chan.

170
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,600
There’s something I want you to help with.

171
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,840
<i>It seems that this mist comes from</i>
<i>the stream surrounding the town,</i>

172
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,600
<i>possibly due to some minerals in the water</i>

173
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,280
<i>mixing with the soil in this area,</i>
<i>causing a thick mist.</i>

174
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,400
<i>If we cut off the stream,</i>
<i>the mist might disappear.</i>

175
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,760
- Go!
- Go!

176
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,560
Go!

177
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,960
Go!

178
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,960
- Go!
- Let go of me!

179
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,520
- Go!
- Let go of me!

180
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,240
Come out!

181
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Get up!

182
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
Hey!

183
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,040
- Get out!
- Go!

184
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,800
Sit down!

185
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,840
Sit down!

186
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,400
What's happening?

187
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,680
- Go!
- Hurry up!

188
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,080
Sit down!

189
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,280
Why are the soldiers shooting people?

190
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,160
Order them to stop shooting now!

191
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,000
It seems you have no intention
of returning to Phra Nakhon with me.

192
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,240
This is my home.

193
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,560
My heart and soul are bound to this place.

194
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,320
Whatever happens outside the town

195
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,920
should remain outside.

196
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,280
The reality of my life is this land,

197
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,560
and you were merely
part of a ritual we follow,

198
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,160
venturing out only
to bring children back to Laplae.

199
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,880
This golden turmeric,
when it leaves the town,

200
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,480
will turn into the gold
as you’ve seen before.

201
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,280
Take it and order your soldiers
to stop harming my people immediately.

202
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,120
I don’t want it.

203
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I only want to ensure that this town
no longer supports the Ngiao rebels.

204
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,880
This place is part of Siam

205
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,440
and must be governed under a single rule,

206
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,960
not by a self-governed minority.

207
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,760
Besides, this golden turmeric
belongs to Siam in the first place.

208
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,600
This is Laplae.
It has never been under anyone’s rule,

209
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,200
and no one will set foot here again.

210
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,520
This town will no longer be a hidden town.

211
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,200
The mist that separates it
from the outside world is dissipating.

212
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,280
Soon, all the people of Siam
will come and go freely.

213
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,160
I’m willing to open the town,

214
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,120
but can I remain

215
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,240
as the Queen?

216
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,160
Just as Laplae cannot govern itself,

217
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,920
a woman cannot govern a town.

218
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,960
Soldiers and an army will come to rule,

219
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,440
and a new King will be appointed.

220
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,200
This is no longer your place.

221
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,520
Go!

222
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,800
Go!

223
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,040
Go!

224
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,240
Stop!

225
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,920
Go!

226
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,280
Go!

227
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,560
Go!

228
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Stop!

229
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,360
Stop!

230
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,960
Stop!

231
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,120
Stop!

232
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,160
Are you ready?

233
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,240
Bua.

234
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
Bua.

235
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,720
What are you going to do?

236
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,000
Bua.

237
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,960
Put out the fire right now
and step away from there.

238
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,760
If you don’t, I’ll shoot.

239
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,240
Father, that’s Mother!

240
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,360
Without the turmeric fields,

241
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,560
Laplae means nothing to anyone.

242
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,560
Get out of there.

243
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,120
Mother Bua! Mother Bua!

244
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,960
Let me go! Let go!

245
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,720
If I can’t have it,

246
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,080
then no one will.

247
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,720
No!

248
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,040
Let me go!

249
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,080
- Bua!
- Mother Bua!

250
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Mother!

251
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,400
I bow to you.

252
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,280
I bow to you.

253
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
I bow to you, Goddess Som.

254
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,960
Mother!

255
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,520
Mother Bua!

256
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,840
Sir, the turmeric we dug up
before the fields were burned

257
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,120
has been loaded onto the wagons.

258
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,800
Burn it all.

259
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,160
Don’t let anyone take it outside the town.
It’s not ours.

260
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,120
But this turmeric will turn into gold Sir.

261
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,600
That’s an order.

262
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,880
Yes Sir.

263
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Kahla,

264
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,159
let's go.

265
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,440
The crown suits you well.

266
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,199
Mother Bua,

267
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,360
it won't be good if someone sees it.

268
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,320
The Queen herself placed it on your head.
Who would dare say anything?

269
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,840
Then blow it.

270
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,520
Here. Place your hand like this.

271
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,520
The index finger and the ring finger,
and on this side as well.

272
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes.

273
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,840
The kindness you once showed me,

274
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,480
I deeply appreciate.

275
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,040
Som Po.

276
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,800
Sir, do you know where Mr. Chan is?

277
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,240
Mr. Chan? I saw him
leave the town in the morning.

278
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,640
But I don't know where he went.

279
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,000
Thank you.

280
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,880
Som Po.

281
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,640
Let's go.

282
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,120
There's no more Misty Edge.

283
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,120
Laplae is gone also.

284
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,400
Alright. Then where will you take me?

285
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,960
I'll take you to live with my people.

286
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,160
We'll raise our child there.

287
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,520
Hello. When will you grow up?

288
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,160
You're coming with us, right?

289
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,840
Thank you so much.

290
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,640
You’ve always taken care of me
ever since I was young,

291
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,040
but now I’ve been through so much,

292
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,040
I can take care of myself from now on.

293
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,840
<i>Hey.</i>

294
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,600
Take good care of yourself, okay?

295
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,920
If you ever feel lost or unsure,
head north.

296
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,280
I’ll be waiting for you.

297
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,600
Thank you Kahla.

298
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,600
Thank you too.

299
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,520
Let’s hope fate brings us together again,

300
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,440
and we can let our children
play together one day.

301
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,760
Now, wherever you take me,

302
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,440
it’s all up to you.

303
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,080
Som Po, I wish you the best,

304
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,440
and may you and your child
stay safe from now on.

305
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,000
Take good care of yourself.
I’m going to steal your friend now.

306
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Goodbye.

307
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,120
Promise me
that you won't run away from me.

308
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,920
I promise.

309
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,840
How is our child?

310
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,320
<i>No matter how many times you forget me,</i>
<i>I’ll accept it,</i>

311
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,440
as long as

312
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,920
I can keep loving you.

313
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,200
I’m looking for a woman.
Could you help me?

314
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,040
What’s her name?

315
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,600
Som Po.

316
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,760
