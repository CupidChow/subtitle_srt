00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,760
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,720
Aren't you happy?

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,520
- She has a husband now.
- You know that

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,840
if we don’t return
to the town within two months,

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,280
<i>we could face great danger.</i>

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
Is it prenatal medicine?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,720
Kahla!

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,080
Who gave you this medicine?

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,480
Som Po.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,160
I want someone to change Laplae,

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,280
abolish these ancient rules,

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,960
so no one has to suffer
or be separated from their child,

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,160
whether it’s a daughter or a devil.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,280
Addictive… drugs?

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,560
Thank you Devil Chan,
for making me the flute.

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,440
You said you could play the flute.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,120
So I wanted to hear
the sound of your flute.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,760
My mother taught me.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,520
The Crocodile constellation is up.

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,800
Let’s head back to the tent Som Po.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,640
Where’s the Crocodile constellation?
I only see the Elephant constellation.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,040
The four stars aligned in a rectangle,

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,120
with a tail of three more stars,

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,000
that’s what we call
the Crocodile constellation.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,920
Who says?

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,200
That rectangle is the elephant’s body,

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,520
and the three stars in a row
are its trunk.

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Okay, Elephant constellation it is.
Whatever my wife calls it,

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,400
I’ll call it too.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Anyway, shall we head back?

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,760
If it gets any later,
it will probably get cold.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,360
I don’t want my Som Po to catch a cold.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,360
Let’s watch the Elephant constellation

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
and smell the orange jasmine
a little longer.

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
I don’t ever want to forget this night.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,760
In that case, I’ll bring my Som Po
to stargaze every night.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,960
I’ll bring you so often
that you'll get tired of remembering.

41
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,760
Whoa, what are you crying for Chaba?

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,840
We went through all the devil-hunting
and getting pregnant.

43
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,680
I dreamed of having a daughter

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
and living a comfortable life.

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,520
How did it turn out like this?

46
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
What did we do wrong Songpeep?

47
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,560
We didn’t do anything wrong.

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,160
Our only fault
is being a threat to the Queen’s daughter.

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,520
Do you think that our miscarriages

50
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,480
are because of the Queen?

51
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,720
What else can it be? How foolish of you?

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,440
Slandering the Queen like this,

53
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,360
won’t Goddess Som be angered?

54
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,120
I’m afraid the Mist Demon might come out.

55
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
Fine, let it come!

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,960
- Kill me already!
- Songpeep.

57
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Are you suffocating in this city?

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,200
Do you want to join forces with me?

59
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,640
Lady Guardian Angkab.

60
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,840
Aren't you already dead?

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,560
We’ve been oppressed
under the rule of Bua’s family,

62
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,960
who claim the will of Goddess Som

63
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,680
and elevate themselves
above everyone else.

64
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,480
Yet they are deceitful
and crooked at heart.

65
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,160
- That's right.
- That's right.

66
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,640
- Deceitful and crooked at heart.
- They oppressed us.

67
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,920
- We won't stand it.
- We won't.

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,520
If you’re going to start a war,
you must begin stockpiling weapons.

69
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
<i>Befriend the crossbow maker,</i>
<i>get close, and gain her trust.</i>

70
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,400
It’s beautifully crafted,

71
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,840
perfectly balanced with excellent weight.

72
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,040
The handle fits comfortably in my hand,

73
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,400
showing thorough
consideration in its design.

74
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,280
You know about crossbows too?

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,600
Then stop by here more often,

76
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,240
so we can talk.

77
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
Sure.

78
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,880
<i>The fight isn’t likely to end soon.</i>

79
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,080
<i>We need to stock up on supplies.</i>

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,920
- It's a lot. How will we transport it?
- We can take more.

81
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,600
<i>Embezzle the food bit by bit,</i>

82
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,640
<i>without anyone noticing.</i>

83
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,960
Let's go.

84
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
‪Go.

85
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,720
If we can prove the Queen’s corruption,

86
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,480
many more will join us.

87
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,400
I’m suspicious about
the devil-hunter selection day.

88
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,080
Som Po’s hand turned that gold color.
She must have cheated.

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,080
And the only one capable of that
would be Lady Healer.

90
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,600
The healer is involved as you said,

91
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,160
but I don’t know

92
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,720
how that white powder
ended up on Som Po’s hands

93
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
or how it turned into gold.

94
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,440
Are you four ready?

95
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,680
Lady Healer held Som Po's hand.

96
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,040
I was there. I saw it with my own eyes.

97
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,160
What are you doing? Hurry up.

98
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm drinking water.

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,040
It's hot. I'm thirsty.

100
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,400
Hurry up.

101
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Yes.

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
Here it is.

103
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,640
Don't spill it.

104
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
We don't have a lot.

105
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,120
It's hard to get.

106
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
Let me try.

107
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
It turns gold.

108
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,080
- What powder?
- White herbal root powder.

109
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,280
The Queen really cheated for her daughter.

110
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,160
We will no longer tolerate this.

111
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
- We won't tolerate this.
- We won't.

112
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,480
- We won't tolerate this.
- We won't.

113
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,720
- We won't.
- We won't.

114
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,120
- We won't tolerate this.
- We won't.

115
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,440
- We won't tolerate this.
- We won't.

116
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,680
- That's right.
- The Queen cheated for her daughter.

117
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
Yes, we won't tolerate it.

118
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,400
‪We won't tolerate this.

119
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,120
I apologize Mother.

120
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,400
Please forgive this useless daughter.

121
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,760
Aw.

122
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,320
How did you get here?

123
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,520
What is this?

124
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,280
It smells good.

125
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,400
Is it prenatal medicine?

126
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,320
Thank you.

127
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,680
But…

128
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,960
I don't deserve this medicine.

129
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,080
It's alright,

130
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
keep it for another woman.

131
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,440
Wait. What's wrong with you?

132
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you doing?

133
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,240
Stop.

134
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,960
What are you doing?

135
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,360
Som Po, she's going to kill us.

136
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
Som Po, back off.

137
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,440
Kahla.

138
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,880
Kahla.

139
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,280
I’ll shoot you for sure!

140
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
‪Kahla.

141
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,440
‪Kahla.

142
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,960
Don't come closer.

143
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,280
- Let's go.
- Kahla, what is this?

144
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,280
Don't talk now. Let's run.

145
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Som Po.

146
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,560
Why would the mute woman
want to kill me?

147
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,640
Isn’t…

148
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,680
the punishment to have the mute woman
who takes care of the Maiden House,

149
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
also be the one

150
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,400
to execute devil-hunters
who don’t return home on time?

151
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,760
Are you crazy?

152
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,480
Just for returning home late?

153
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Does it really warrant killing?

154
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,960
What's up with your town?

155
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,359
Kahla, are you alright?

156
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,839
I'm alright. it’s just a minor cut.

157
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,960
Som Po, how about you?

158
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm fine.

159
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,200
It’s all because of me

160
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,360
- that you ended up--
- It's not your fault.

161
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
I thought you already went home.

162
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,400
How could I go home
when you're in danger?

163
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,880
I'll find some medicine
to treat your wound.

164
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,640
I'll just go there.

165
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,320
I'm not going far.

166
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,400
Devil Min,
please stop the bleeding for her.

167
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,320
Ouch! Don't push too hard.

168
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,800
Fine.

169
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,000
You deserve it.

170
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
Are you mad at me?

171
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
No.

172
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,280
I just don't understand.

173
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,240
You argued with Som Po

174
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,960
and wanted to go home
without caring about me.

175
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,320
But when she was in danger,
you rushed back to help,

176
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
getting yourself hurt.

177
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,760
You’re pregnant,

178
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,800
yet you didn’t care about yourself
or your baby at all?

179
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,920
So what?
If it was you, would you help your friend?

180
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,200
Right?

181
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,960
I also want to know if it was me,

182
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,920
would you risk your life like this?

183
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
Have you ever felt
even half as much for me

184
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,280
as you do for Som Po?

185
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,800
Oh.

186
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,560
Kahla, I've found the medicine.

187
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
Som Po, watch out.

188
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,880
Turn around. Watch out.

189
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
Som Po!

190
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,160
Devil Chan.

191
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,480
Chan.

192
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,920
Som Po.

193
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,400
- Don't do it.
- Stop.

194
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
Som Po, back off.

195
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,600
- Don't do it.
- No.

196
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
- No.
- Don't do it.

197
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,320
Aunt Eungpueng.

198
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,200
Som Po.

199
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,720
Som Po.

200
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,600
Chan.

201
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,120
Wake up.

202
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,400
Wake up.

203
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,640
Why is it like this? Wake up.

204
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Here.

205
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Slowly put him down.

206
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,640
Hey Am.

207
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,040
Mr. Chan.

208
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,200
Mr. Chan.

209
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,800
Hey.

210
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,840
This is bad.

211
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Mr. Chan.

212
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,880
I need to stop the bleeding for him.

213
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,240
Herbs.

214
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,840
- I need to find some herbs.
- Herbs?

215
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,440
- Herbs?
- Herbs?

216
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,360
- I've made it.
- Herbs?

217
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
- Kahla, help me press here.
- Let's go. Hurry up.

218
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,880
- What is this?
- Just find it.

219
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,240
You'll be alright.

220
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,720
You'll be alright.

221
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,560
- Am.
- Here's the medicine.

222
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,160
Here it is.

223
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,040
Press here.

224
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,040
Here's some water.

225
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,120
Mr. Chan, please don't die.

226
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,640
Am, here.

227
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,240
Here are the herbs.

228
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,080
- Hurry up.
- Here they are.

229
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,520
‪-Here they are.
‪-You'll be alright.

230
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,400
You'll be alright.

231
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,120
The bleeding has stopped.

232
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,120
Aunt Eungpueng.

233
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,200
How could you leave the town?

234
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,120
Devil-hunters who don't return home
in two months will face the death penalty.

235
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,080
They have to be executed
according to the law.

236
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,080
The Queen sent me to protect Som Po

237
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,560
and bring her back to Laplae.

238
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,600
Why is Som Po
looking at the devil like that?

239
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
She probably just feels sorry for him.

240
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,040
You're both pregnant aren't you?

241
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,120
We are.

242
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,440
But…

243
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,440
We don't have much time left.
The people of Laplae are waiting.

244
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,800
My mother must be so worried about me.

245
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,280
Kahla.

246
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,560
Listen to me.

247
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,040
Your mother

248
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
has passed away.

249
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,640
Aunt Eungpueng,

250
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,800
if you’re lying as a joke,

251
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,120
it’s a serious offense in our town.

252
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,840
Does this sound like a joke?

253
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,440
Lady Guardian was executed.

254
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,280
Executed? How could my mother be executed?

255
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,960
Lady Guardian secretly left the town.

256
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,520
Did she have to be executed for that?

257
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,640
Kahla, strange things
happen in the town every day.

258
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,680
I also don't understand.

259
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,360
But the Queen ordered me to find Som Po
and bring her back to Laplae.

260
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,680
So,

261
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,000
right now,
we all need to return to Laplae first,

262
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,160
then we’ll search for answers.

263
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,400
That's not true, right?

264
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,760
You're kidding me, right?

265
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,840
Som Po.

266
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,440
There's no more negotiation Som Po.

267
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
You must return to Laplae with us.

268
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
- I think I said it clearly.
- You don't know anything.

269
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,800
Aunt Eungpueng said
a lot of things are happening in Laplae.

270
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,560
There is also a rumor
that my mother is dead.

271
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,360
We have to return to Laplae immediately.

272
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,920
Your mother is dead?

273
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,880
You can go first.

274
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,760
Give me some time.

275
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,880
And I'll go later.

276
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,320
Som Po.

277
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,520
You need to be aware.
You need to remember why we're here.

278
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,640
We got what we came for.

279
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,920
I'm pregnant. You're pregnant.

280
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Forget the devil. You have to
return to Laplae with me now.

281
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,520
Why are you talking like this?

282
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,640
The devil just saved my life.
Didn't you see it?

283
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,160
You have no heart.
You've never loved anyone.

284
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,080
So you don't feel it.

285
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,160
If the town is in chaos,

286
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,320
wouldn’t that be your chance?

287
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
If you want the Queen position, take it.

288
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,960
If I wanted the Queen position,

289
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,240
I wouldn't waste my time
trying to bring you back.

290
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,120
And you know what?
They said that my mother died

291
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,160
because your mother executed her.

292
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,680
My mother?

293
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,600
You can ignore it
or pretend nothing happened.

294
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,360
I’m done, really done.
If you want to die here, then go ahead.

295
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,920
I won't be friends
with a fool like you anymore.

296
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,200
Why hasn’t Eungpueng
brought Som Po back to Laplae by now?

297
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,360
I’m really worried.

298
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,160
- I have something to report my Queen.
- About what?

299
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,680
There has been a theft
of the town’s central supplies.

300
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,360
Who did it?

301
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,440
- The lower class?
- We haven’t found out yet,

302
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,560
but it seems like a group did it
since a large amount was stolen.

303
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,480
- Go and catch the culprits.
- Yes, my Queen.

304
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,000
There are new problems every day.

305
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,040
Kahla.

306
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,960
Are you crying?

307
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,480
What are you doing here?
Go somewhere else.

308
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,520
I'm here to keep you company.

309
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,280
You were talking with your friend loudly.

310
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,680
Did you have a fight?

311
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
Well,

312
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,120
if you had to choose
between hometown and lover,

313
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,920
what would you choose?

314
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,400
I might choose my people.

315
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,520
I shouldn't have asked.

316
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,200
You risked your life to help your friends.

317
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
But if the day ever comes when I’m free

318
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,160
from the control of foreigners,

319
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,640
and the Siamese invasion,

320
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,760
then,

321
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
I might think about love
with all my heart.

322
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,800
But if I want to fight them,

323
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,320
I need to have what they have.

324
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,440
Did you buy the bullets?

325
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,200
Yes.

326
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,200
Here they are.

327
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,320
But this is not enough.

328
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
Then,

329
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,360
how do you use that gun?

330
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,640
Look.

331
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,680
Please wake up.

332
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,400
I want to talk with you.

333
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,400
I don't know how long
we can stay together.

334
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,920
Chan.

335
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,000
What's wrong?

336
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,600
What's wrong?

337
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,080
Am. Am!

338
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,800
What's wrong Som Po?

339
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,960
Hey, he's bleeding.

340
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,080
The herb isn't working anymore.
What should I do?

341
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,440
I think I'll ask Khun Luang for help.

342
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,960
Otherwise, he'll die.

343
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,920
Yeah, it’s clean. That was fast.

344
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,960
There’s nothing left to pick up,

345
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,400
just some cleaning and it's done.

346
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,360
Wasn’t this the execution ground
for Lady Guardian Angkab?

347
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,200
How can you say
there’s nothing left to pick up?

348
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,560
Yes Lady Warden,

349
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,800
not even a scrap of cloth is left.

350
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,000
The punishment
from Goddess Som was so severe,

351
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,800
everything vanished, even her hair.

352
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
Everything vanished?

353
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,920
Well…

354
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,440
I told Lady Warden you were meditating,

355
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,680
but she insists that it's urgent.

356
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,240
It's alright.

357
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,440
What's the matter?

358
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,240
I think…

359
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,320
we forgot something.

360
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,520
Today I patrolled the execution ground.

361
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,120
Workers were cleaning up,

362
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,480
but it was strange.

363
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,280
People were saying there was nothing
to pick up after the execution,

364
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,680
not even a piece of cloth.

365
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,280
All I saw were
small bloodstains on the posts.

366
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,240
What are you thinking?

367
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,640
I think…

368
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,920
You think…

369
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
Lady Guardian is still alive, right?

NEXT EPISODE

371
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,800
Why is my son
on the verge of death like this?

372
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,040
<i>Doctors, take my son to the camp.</i>

373
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,800
- Where is Som Po?
- She doesn't want to go.

374
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,520
I’ll use a tough approach
and take her back myself.

375
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,400
Lady Pudson, there’s a fire!

376
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Get some water!

377
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,360
Are you from the Town of Mist?

378
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,080
