4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm a healer.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,960
My duty is to save lives.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,800
Why are you speaking as if

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,080
you’re completely pure and innocent?

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,040
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,560
The rebel forces

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,240
aren’t as strong
as the Lady Guardians and Wardens,

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,200
but there is a devil among them.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,360
One day, that devil

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
will bring trouble to the rebels.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,840
What are you doing? Let go of me.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,160
I’m not letting anything
happen to my wife and child.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,560
Change doesn’t come easily.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,440
At night we train for battle,

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,080
and by day, we return to being slaves.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,880
No!

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,480
Stop!

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,480
Chaba.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,680
Anyone who still wishes to surrender,

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,320
go now.

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,920
If I surrender now,

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,680
Chaba's death will mean nothing.

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,640
PREVIOUSLY

27
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,120
<i>The people must rise</i>

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,080
<i>Above all</i>

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,160
The rebels are not only opposing me

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
but defying Goddess Som herself.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,960
It’s already late Mali.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,360
You can go home.

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,720
I’ll just finish
grinding this turmeric first.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Oh, even when I tell you to go,
you still don’t.

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,040
You're so little but so stubborn.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,400
Because I’m curious about herbs.

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,280
When I grow up, I want to be like you

38
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,800
and make medicine to save lives.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,040
Oh, you want to be a healer, huh?

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,320
If you want to be a healer,

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,040
you need to go devil-hunting first.

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,080
Did you ever hunt devils?

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,240
You don't have a daughter.

44
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,000
I did.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Mali, go home now.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,240
It's getting late.

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,080
Little Mali is so hardworking.

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,840
No wonder Lady Healer
loves you like her own.

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,160
Mali.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,600
I'll finish the rest.

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,080
Go home now.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,920
I bow to you my Queen.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,920
I bow to you Lady Healer.

54
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,279
I can't.

55
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,399
I can't do it my Queen.

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,560
Have you forgotten

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,200
how you became Lady Healer?

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,280
A woman who was struggling in the fields

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,880
after losing a daughter
in childbirth like you,

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,600
suddenly rising
to the position of Lady Healer.

61
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,800
What did my Mother Bongkod

62
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
see in you?

63
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,560
Was it your skills?

64
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
Your virtue?

65
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
Bear in mind

66
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,400
whose grace

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,680
and for what reason

68
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,560
someone as lowly as you
can be where you are today.

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Forgive me my Queen.

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,000
I beg your forgiveness.

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
Please have mercy,

72
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,120
don’t make me do such a thing.

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,360
Will you allow little Mali
and the daughters of Laplae

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,640
to grow up in a town
where people abandon the rules

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,480
and forget Goddess Som?

76
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
Aren't you hungry?

77
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,120
No.

78
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,920
I can't eat.

79
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,000
I miss Chaba.

80
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,160
If you don't want to eat,
at least drink some water.

81
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,920
The sunlight is so strong,
you'll faint if you're dehydrated.

82
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,600
Thank you.

83
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,120
You've done well.

84
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,920
Lady Healer, her body is so cold.

85
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
Take the warming medicine

86
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
to heat up your body.

87
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,160
Hang in there, okay?

88
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,040
Don’t worry.

89
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,120
I will pray to Goddess Som

90
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,640
to bless and protect everyone
from this illness.

91
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,160
I bow to you Queen Bua.

92
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
I heard there was an outbreak,
so I rushed here.

93
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,520
Should I boil water, prepare medicine,
or do anything else?

94
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,400
Lady Healer, let me help.

95
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Som Po, what are you doing here?

96
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,880
You’ll just be a burden.

97
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,160
But I want to help.

98
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
You’re pregnant.
You shouldn’t stay here long.

99
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,520
If you catch the disease,
what will happen to the baby?

100
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
Think carefully.

101
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,240
No need to worry.

102
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,200
You should go back now.

103
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,200
Go.

104
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Som Po.

105
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
Songpeep, what's wrong with all of you?

106
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,280
We might have caught
the plague from the town.

107
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,120
Ugh! Don't come closer,

108
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,360
or you'll catch the disease.

109
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,440
But you don't cough or sneeze.

110
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,720
Could it be the food?

111
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,400
Did you eat something bad?

112
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,480
We haven’t eaten anything today,

113
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,240
just water.

114
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,320
Water?

115
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,080
Water from the town’s well.

116
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,360
Ugh!

117
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,160
Songpeep, are you alright?

118
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,560
- Come on, let me help you.
- I'm fine.

119
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,280
Go warn the others in the cave.

120
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,360
Hurry up.

121
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,560
Kahla, hurry!

122
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,600
Stop!

123
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,600
- Don’t drink it!
- Mother!

124
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,160
Mother.

125
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Throw it away now!

126
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
That water is spreading the disease.

127
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,840
Did you drink it?

128
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,400
Mother!

129
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,920
Mother!

130
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,840
Mother!

131
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Hey!

132
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,000
This Siam Weed root,

133
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,400
Kahla and I dug it up ourselves.

134
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,880
Even though this isn’t jungle fever,
it should still help relieve the symptoms.

135
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
Mother.

136
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
How are you feeling?

137
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
The medicine is ready.

138
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,040
Please take some Mother.

139
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,840
Here Songpeep.

140
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,080
I won't take it.

141
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,760
I'm so tired.

142
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,560
It would be easier to just die.

143
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,400
Songpeep!

144
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
Why are you saying such things?

145
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,680
No, no, I won’t take it.

146
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,800
Take it.

147
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,720
Goddess Som is punishing us.

148
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,280
Goddess Som is punishing us.

149
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,720
There’s no one left.

150
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,760
Goddess Som is punishing everyone.

151
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,480
Let me go.

152
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,000
We’re in so much pain, almost dying.

153
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,880
What kind of disease is this?

154
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,880
It’s because

155
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,040
the rebels broke the rules.

156
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,520
Goddess Som has brought
this misfortune upon us.

157
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,040
Misfortune?

158
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,840
- Misfortune?
- Yes.

159
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,800
But if anyone follows
Goddess Som’s guidance,

160
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,720
there’s no need to worry.

161
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,520
She will not abandon us.

162
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,680
This medicine,

163
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,720
was kindly granted by Goddess Som
and it works well.

164
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,640
We bow to Goddess Som. Bow to Goddess Som.

165
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,160
By now, the rebels

166
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,280
must be nearing their limits.

167
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
It won’t be long

168
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,320
before they line up here for the medicine.

169
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,119
It seems my medicine
isn’t working after all.

170
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
Ugh!

171
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,760
Everyone, listen.

172
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,360
There’s still a way to survive.

173
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Hurry into the town and get the medicine.

174
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,960
Your lives are the priority.

175
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,400
What about you Lady Guardian?

176
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,600
No matter what, Bua won’t spare me.

177
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,040
I choose to die here.

178
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,920
Lady Guardian…

179
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Goya…

180
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,960
We’ve lost.

181
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Kahla, we’ll go to the town

182
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,560
and steal the medicine for your mother,
no matter what.

183
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,440
Hey,

184
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,160
don’t be sad Kahla.

185
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,760
Why are you crying? Come here. Let's hug.

186
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
Why do you want to hug me?

187
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,240
Whoa, husband and wife hugging

188
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,960
is normal. And besides,

189
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,080
when you hug,

190
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,120
it makes you feel better.
Isn’t that right?

191
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,080
No need.

192
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,240
Just you sitting here with me is enough.

193
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,960
There they are, Songpeep and the others.

194
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,480
What are you doing?

195
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,840
That doesn't look good.

196
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,120
What are you doing? Let me go!

197
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
- Rebels!
- Let me go.

198
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,480
They've caused this calamity. Seize them!

199
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,600
Let go of me.

200
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
Anyone who hasn’t done wrong
has nothing to fear.

201
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,520
Goddess Som has sent a vision,

202
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,000
and all the Wardens know

203
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,160
who the rebels are

204
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,720
and who deserves punishment.

205
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,360
Why doesn’t Goddess Som punish you?

206
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,600
You killed my child, just because
you feared losing your child’s position.

207
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
- You filthy crow!
- You wretch!

208
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,480
Let go of me.

209
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Grief from losing your child

210
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,280
must have clouded your judgment.

211
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,280
Now speak honestly, no more lies.

212
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,080
Among you,

213
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,800
there is a devil, right?

214
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,720
Huh? A devil?

215
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,760
You have broken the most severe law

216
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,000
by letting Kahla
bring a devil into the town

217
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,280
and she brought calamity upon Laplae.

218
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,640
The devil is the source

219
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,960
of the plague that nearly wiped us out.

220
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,040
Whether you live or die,

221
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,760
that is up to Goddess Som to decide.

222
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,920
May you all die,

223
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,600
you filthy rebels!
Apologize to Goddess Som now!

224
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
- Ugh…
- You filthy rebels!

225
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,320
- You filthy rebels!
- You stupid!

226
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,960
It's because you let Kahla

227
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,120
bring the devil in…

228
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,320
- You're stupid!
- You filthy rebels!

229
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,800
You're the stupid one!

230
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,840
You filthy rebels!

231
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,880
- You brat!
- Let go of me!

232
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,040
- I'm not a rebel!
- Let go of me!

233
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,480
You filthy rebels!

234
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,960
You're getting better now.
You can go home.

235
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,200
Mali.

236
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,960
Mali.

237
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,960
Mali.

238
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,640
Mali!

239
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,240
Mali!

240
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,400
Mali!

241
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,960
Mali, wake up.
Look, all the people you took care of

242
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,080
have recovered now.

243
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,280
Don't you want to be a healer Mali?

244
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,200
You can't just die like this!

245
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,200
Mali!

246
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,800
Lady Som Po, where are you going?

247
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,520
I’m going to the medicine house.

248
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,040
Unless it’s something urgent, I think--

249
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
Nothing is more urgent than this.

250
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,240
My stomach hurts.
I need to go for a prenatal check-up.

251
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,880
Lady Som Po!

252
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,160
I heard that people
have died from the disease.

253
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,000
Did you know and help Queen Bua
spread this plague?

254
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,440
How could you do such a thing?

255
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,800
How could you?

256
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,440
Little Mali has died.

257
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,680
They're guarding.
How are we going to get in?

258
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,680
I’ll try circling around to the back.

259
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,040
There might be another way in.

260
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,080
Who’s there? Come out now!

261
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,440
Here goes nothing. I’ll distract them
over there, go and get the medicine.

262
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,320
That way!

263
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
Som Po…

264
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,760
I’ll hurry to find a way

265
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,520
to get the medicine to everyone.

266
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,080
I bow to you, Lady Healer.

267
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,120
Wait, Som Po.

268
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
This notebook…

269
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,720
it’s valuable.

270
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,480
Why are you giving it to me?

271
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,280
I won’t be needing it anymore.

272
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,000
What do you mean by that Lady Healer?

273
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,280
Hurry up.

274
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,480
The longer you delay,
the more people will die.

275
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,320
- Kahla.
- Som Po.

276
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,280
Capture her!

277
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,480
Let's go!

278
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,880
Did you see anyone here?

279
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,360
We were chasing someone suspicious.

280
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,760
It was someone more muscular
than usual women,

281
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,880
likely the devil who's with the rebels.

282
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,920
Spread out and find them.

283
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,120
Yes Lady.

284
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
Ugh!

285
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,200
Follow them!

286
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,960
Run!

287
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,640
Lady Guardian.

288
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,120
Did you see anyone suspicious
come this way?

289
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,680
Suspicious? I haven’t seen anyone.

290
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,320
But if it was a sound,
I did hear something strange.

291
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,840
What kind of sound? From where?

292
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,680
It was a voice, but deeper than a woman’s.

293
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,400
Over that way.

294
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,400
But I think whoever it was
is long gone by now.

295
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,080
Hurry up, let’s go.

296
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
You’re safe now.

297
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,800
Here’s the medicine.
Take it to the rebels.

298
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,760
I apologize

299
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,000
for everything Queen Bua has done.

300
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,320
None of this is your fault Som Po.

301
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,680
You don’t need to apologize for anything.

302
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,320
Thank you so much.

303
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,800
Kahla,

304
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,000
I think we should hurry.

305
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,080
I have to go now.

306
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,320
Mother, how are you feeling?

307
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,560
I'm much better now.

308
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,800
Thank you so much.

309
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,239
What a relief about your mother, right?

310
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,239
Why do you still look so worried?

311
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,320
Well, now that we're here,

312
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,480
let me ask you one thing.

313
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,640
How do you really feel about Som Po?

314
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,440
The weather’s nice, isn’t it?

315
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,360
Yes.

316
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,720
Perfect for us to go climb some trees.

317
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,120
Hey, why are you laughing?

318
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,800
You go climb by yourself.

319
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,800
What about you?

320
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,200
No.

321
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,440
No matter who I’m with,

322
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,080
I’m never as happy as I am
when I’m by your side, Som Po.

323
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,840
Som Po…

324
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
What? Can you really just
fall asleep sitting like this?

325
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,600
<i>My feelings are forbidden.</i>

326
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
<i>They go against the rules.</i>

327
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,440
No, they don’t.

328
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,640
It’s the rules that are wrong,

329
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,920
not your feelings.

330
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,320
Love, Kahla,

331
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,200
isn’t,

332
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,040
and has never been something wrong.

333
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,960
I love you even though you don’t love me,
and I’ve never felt guilty about it.

334
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,240
And if the rebellion succeeds,

335
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,520
just get rid of those stupid rules.

336
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,120
Thank you, really.

337
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,800
If you really want to thank me,

338
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,920
could you just sit here
with me for a while?

339
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,400
Don’t leave yet.

340
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,680
If you walk away now, I’ll definitely cry.

341
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,440
You're recovered now.

342
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,440
I feel so sorry for Songpeep
and our comrades who were captured.

343
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,160
We need to regain our strength quickly
so we can go and rescue them.

344
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,520
I'm still wondering

345
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,160
how Bua and Pudson

346
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,720
know which one of us is a rebel.

347
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,000
And how did they know
there was a devil among us?

348
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,880
Who gave them the medicine?

349
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Who?

350
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,720
I heard Kahla got the medicine from…

351
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,560
Som Po.

352
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,840
Last night,

353
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,800
I saw her meeting with Kahla
at the medicine house.

354
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,960
She probably got it
from Lady Healer, my Queen.

355
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,680
Go!

356
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,680
Pudson.

357
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,200
Because of your deadly potion,

358
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,960
an innocent child

359
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,240
like Mali had to die.

360
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,520
You made that potion yourself.

361
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,320
You turned me into a murderer.

362
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
Listening to you,

363
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,680
it sounds like the words
of someone who's never killed before.

364
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,640
Have you forgotten that

365
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,080
you earned this Lady Healer position

366
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,760
because you killed the previous one.

367
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,560
But that was because
I followed Queen Bongkod's order.

368
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,680
You made your own choices,

369
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,320
whether to kill or not,

370
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,640
whether to make the potion or not,

371
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,680
whether to give the medicine
to Som Po or not.

372
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,640
When it’s time to face the consequences,

373
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
don’t blame anyone else.

374
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,720
But rest easy,

375
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,520
I’ll let you choose.

376
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,840
Will you die by your own hand

377
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,440
or by the hand of the Mist Demon?

378
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,440
My Queen.

379
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,720
My Queen. Queen Bua.

380
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,240
Since you returned from devil-hunting,

381
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,600
you’ve been defiant towards me.

382
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,760
NEXT EPISODE

383
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,440
I want to meet your leader.

384
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
You scum of the town!

385
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,760
- My name is--
- Som Po.

386
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,440
