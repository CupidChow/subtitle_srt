00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,080
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,920
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED
FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,720
And aren’t you afraid

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,280
that another woman
might give birth to a daughter

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,200
who could take the position
of Queen from Som Po?

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,480
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,760
Eh?

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,800
The elders say that pregnant women
shouldn’t eat safflower petals.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,960
Goya!

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,680
<i>I'm a healer.</i>

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>How could I possibly give safflower petals</i>

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,320
- Blood!
<i>- to pregnant women?</i>

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,840
Protect my child

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,240
as I am protecting Khemkao right now.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,280
Do you want more than a stick of gold?

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,480
Tonight will be the last time you see me.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,640
Come on.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,320
Som Po, copulate with Devil Min.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,480
Som Po.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,640
Lady.

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
Lady, I saw you at the market.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,960
Did you see Som Po?

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,800
Devil Chan,

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,000
you had the chance
to be intimate with Som Po,

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,480
but you pushed her away and rejected her.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,560
Now, she must fulfill her duty
by being with another devil.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
I'm asking where Som Po is.

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,560
Som Po.

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,600
I have to fulfill my duty.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,520
Hurry up and do what you have to do.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm ready.

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,760
People who are ready
wouldn’t have faces like ours.

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,280
Are you not willing to do it either?

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,240
You know, right?

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,960
I got Kahla pregnant. I’m her husband now.

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,720
And now, you expect me
to do this with… my wife's friend?

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,160
I think it’s…

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,000
If that's the case,

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,160
I'll find another devil
to fulfill the duty.

41
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,440
It's Kahla's order.

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
I have to do it.

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Let's start.

44
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,400
Som Po.

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,080
Som Po.

46
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
Wait.

47
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,240
Let me prepare myself first.

48
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,560
However long it takes, you need to do it.

49
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,400
Min.

50
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,520
Copulate with her.

51
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,680
If she doesn't, she'll be in danger.

52
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,160
Don't be afraid.

53
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,160
Close your eyes and imagine…

54
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,800
that Devil Min is Devil Chan.

55
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,560
It will help you.

56
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
I've been through it.

57
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,760
I don't understand women like you at all.

58
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,920
Come on.

59
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,240
Let's get it over with. Close your eyes.

60
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,800
Close your eyes.

61
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
Close your eyes.

62
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,120
Don't touch Som Po.

63
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,760
Stop, Devil Chan.

64
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
Devil Chan,

65
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,920
if you don't want to copulate with Som Po,
then get out.

66
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,880
We have duties to fulfill.

67
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,680
Did you…

68
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,440
Did you ever love me at all?

69
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,880
Or was it all just about
wanting to copulate with me?

70
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
I…

71
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,680
Have you ever felt that…

72
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
you want to stay with me,

73
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,400
miss me

74
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
when we're not together,

75
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,200
want me to be safe,

76
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,960
don't want me to suffer?

77
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,280
I don't know what love is.

78
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,080
But I've been…

79
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,560
thinking about you…

80
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,040
ever since I saw you in my dream.

81
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,520
I've never forgotten your face,
Devil Chan.

82
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,200
Apart from you,

83
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
I don't want to copulate with anyone.

84
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,160
Do you really mean it?

85
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,160
If that's the case,

86
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,080
can I ask you for one thing?

87
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,640
It's a good day

88
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,760
for both of them.

89
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,320
We can see stars tonight.

90
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,480
- It's a good day.
- Yes.

91
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,960
Really?

92
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
- It's too bad.
- Why?

93
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,920
Because tonight…

94
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,840
Right?

95
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,600
I promise I'll take good care of you.

96
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,280
Kahla,

97
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,560
aren't you happy?

98
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
She has a husband now.

99
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,560
Or are you just jealous?

100
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Whoa.

101
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,240
We’re husband and wife now.

102
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,120
Som Po.

103
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,160
I thought you would have run away.

104
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,480
I'm not running away.

105
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,640
Then, how was it?

106
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,120
Do you think
you'll get the child you want?

107
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,640
I don't know yet.

108
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,240
Or to make sure, we may have to…

109
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,400
I think…

110
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
we should see the result first.

111
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Som Po,

112
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,320
this is the first morning for us
as husband and wife.

113
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
Goddess Som, show us your mercy.

114
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,240
Homage to the Goddess,
glorious and radiant,

115
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
in reverence.

116
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,880
May Goddess Som
call your spirit back to you,

117
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,320
tying the left wrist to bring your spirit,

118
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,640
and the right wrist to keep it here.

119
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,720
I don’t know what omen this is,

120
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,120
but two women miscarrying
one after another,

121
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,080
- it must be…
- Goddess Som’s doing.

122
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,880
That's right, Goddess Som’s doing.

123
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,080
It's definitely Goddess Som’s doing.

124
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Kahla and Som Po haven't returned yet.

125
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,280
There are only Somsook and Rampoei left.

126
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,720
It’s possible that
Goddess Som might ordain

127
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,880
one of them to become the next Queen.

128
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,480
I’m going to attend
the spirit-calling ceremony.

129
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,160
It must be cursed.
There are women who have miscarried.

130
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,440
Why would you go there?

131
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,920
I won’t miscarry. My pregnancy is healthy.

132
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,280
It seems the child in my womb
is destined for greatness.

133
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,880
If you give birth to a devil,
I'll laugh my heart out.

134
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,920
Watch your mouth! Inauspicious talk!

135
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,120
You're the one giving birth to the devil.

136
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,800
This needs purification.

137
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,880
Wipe the floor Goya.

138
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,520
If we slip and miscarry too,

139
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,520
you’ll face Goddess Som’s punishment.

140
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,520
When will Chaba and Songpeep return?

141
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,600
They won't return.

142
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,040
After the ceremony,
they will become lower class

143
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,120
and be sent to work in the fields.

144
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm bringing you food,

145
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
Lady Guardian Angkab.

146
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,640
Huh?

147
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,760
‪Hurry up!

148
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Oh.

149
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,680
Are you awake Lady Guardian?

150
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Here.

151
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,480
Why did you help me?

152
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,520
You’ve given birth to a devil.

153
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,640
That's not true.

154
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,080
Be prepared to be a laborer.

155
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I want someone to change Laplae,

156
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,680
abolish these ancient rules,

157
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
so no one has to suffer

158
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,840
or be separated from their child,

159
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,360
whether it’s a daughter or a devil.

160
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,760
You almost lost your life
because of Goddess Som’s laws.

161
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
If the Queen’s power isn’t overthrown,

162
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,920
will you and Kahla survive
until the next new moon?

163
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
Overthrown?

164
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,520
Those who suffer and feel
trapped by the rules of Laplae

165
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,960
aren’t just you and me.

166
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,960
I want to ask you to become our leader.

167
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,880
From now on, don’t devote yourself
to gods or any sacred beings,

168
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,280
but instead, dedicate yourself to us,

169
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,040
to the lower class,
the ones forsaken by Goddess Som.

170
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,720
What do you say?

171
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,200
Why do you want me there again?

172
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,000
Because if Som Po
isn't pregnant yet, you can…

173
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,680
Som Po is married
and she's with her husband.

174
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
Do you want the golden turmeric?

175
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,520
Of course I want it.

176
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
But now, I think one won’t be worth it.

177
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,840
How about giving me ten?

178
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,480
Greedy devils only want gold.

179
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,080
Your town isn’t at war with anyone.

180
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,080
All you think about is getting pregnant.

181
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,080
How could you understand a Ngiao like me?

182
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,000
Don't come if you don't want to.
I can go by myself.

183
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,360
What's happened?

184
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,000
What did they die from?

185
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,760
It looks like an arrow wound,
but there's no arrow.

186
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,120
I heard you have gold.

187
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,720
Hand it over.

188
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Don't.

189
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,360
Do you see how these two died?

190
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,400
It's in his hand.

191
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,000
Is that the gun that you want?

192
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,360
How is it better than a knife?

193
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
That's so loud.

194
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,000
Give me the gold.

195
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,920
Calm down brother.

196
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,080
Give it to him, now.

197
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,240
Huh?

198
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,600
Otherwise, we'll both die.

199
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,320
Alright.

200
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,880
Take it.

201
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,960
Kahla, did you get hurt?

202
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
Let me try it.

203
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,040
I know now why you wanted a gun.

204
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,280
One person with a gun
can fight ten other people.

205
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,560
That's right.

206
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,080
If you know it,
give me the golden turmeric.

207
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,520
So I can buy more bullets.

208
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
What did I say?

209
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,040
When Som Po is pregnant
and ready to return home,

210
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,400
you'll get one golden turmeric
as we agreed.

211
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
What are you doing Som Po?

212
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,240
I want to discuss something important.

213
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,160
What is it?

214
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,920
I want to live with you forever Som Po.

215
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,320
Can you not go back to your town?

216
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,080
I have to go back, no matter what.

217
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,120
But if you don't get pregnant,
you can't go, right?

218
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,440
Or you are…

219
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,240
How would you know the result
that early? I'm dumb.

220
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,440
We, the people of Laplae,

221
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,840
have a way to check
for pregnancy that gives results

222
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,400
just a day

223
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,640
after copulation.

224
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,400
Then, you are…

225
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,440
If that's the case,
I definitely can’t let you go back.

226
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,240
I love you Som Po.
Please stay with me here.

227
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,880
The three of us

228
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,280
will be together.

229
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,080
The Teacher said that

230
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,120
anyone who doesn’t return to the town

231
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,960
will meet a tragic end.

232
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,440
Bad things will happen.

233
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,520
I don't know what to do now.

234
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,120
No bad things will happen to you.

235
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,320
I will protect you.

236
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
Don't worry.

237
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,800
Sixty days, the deadline to return,

238
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,920
the execution deadline.

239
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,240
I knew that song must be yours.

240
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,840
Why are you playing the flute here?

241
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,160
How many times did you copulate?

242
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,040
Have you checked for pregnancy yet?

243
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,400
Devil Chan can't do it or something?

244
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,320
Or do you want me to…

245
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,800
When were you planning to tell me
that you're pregnant?

246
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,720
You knew I've been waiting
to go home with you.

247
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,640
Why are you hiding it?

248
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,520
I didn't want to hide it.

249
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,720
I wanted to tell you.

250
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,800
When would you tell me?

251
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,440
It seems you’ve forgotten Laplae,

252
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,159
your friends, and all your duties.

253
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,440
That's not true.
I'm definitely going home.

254
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,679
Just wait a little longer to make sure.

255
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,080
What are you waiting for?

256
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,719
Yesterday marked two months
since we left Laplae.

257
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,760
We must return to the city on time,

258
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,719
or we’ll face severe punishment
by the law. Did you forget that?

259
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,520
Be honest with me.

260
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,520
Do you want to go back to Laplae with me?

261
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
I pity Queen Bua,

262
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,840
waiting for her daughter
to return home pregnant.

263
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,800
But you’ve been infatuated with the devil,

264
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,520
ignoring your mother’s feelings.

265
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,320
Then who will be the Queen?

266
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,040
Why don't you do it?

267
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
I’m not virtuous

268
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,280
and I am unworthy of the position.

269
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,720
You’re more deserving in every way.

270
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,960
Kahla,

271
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
you should return home.

272
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,880
I'll stay here.

273
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,520
I won't go home.

274
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,440
What have I been waiting for?

275
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,920
If I had known this,
I would have gone home long ago.

276
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,080
What?

277
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
Is it prenatal medicine?

278
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,360
Thank you. Leave it there.

279
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,120
I'm packing now.

280
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,960
I know, I know.

281
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,760
Let me pack my things first.

282
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,560
Som Po?

283
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,760
She's at the railway camp with a devil.

284
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,840
Are you taking it to her?
You don't need to.

285
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,720
She didn't listen to me at all.

286
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,160
Kahla.

287
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,840
Are you running away from me?

288
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,800
Where's my turmeric?

289
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,040
Som Po is not going home with me.
The deal is canceled.

290
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,440
What? What about what we agreed?

291
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,840
Whoa, and look,
my prenatal medicine spilled.

292
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,640
Kahla,

293
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,160
I don't think it' prenatal medicine.

294
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,000
Who gave you this medicine?

295
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,200
Som Po.

296
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,520
Som Po.

297
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Som Po.

298
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,320
I apologize.

299
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,360
I mistook you for someone else.

300
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,880
What's that?

301
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,440
- That's the crazy guy.
- Capture him.

302
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,240
He's crazy.

303
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,920
- Hurry up. Capture him.
- Go.

304
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,440
- Hey.
- Go.

305
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,000
Capture him.

306
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,760
- Hey.
- What?

307
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Take him.

308
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,240
- Take him.
- Take him.

309
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,080
Hey.

310
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,080
Addicts who can’t afford drugs

311
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,680
and resort to robbery like this.

312
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,120
They become crazy.

313
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,400
Addictive substances,
once taken, you can’t go without.

314
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,400
Whatever they tell him, he has to obey.

315
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,840
Addictive…

316
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,000
drugs?
