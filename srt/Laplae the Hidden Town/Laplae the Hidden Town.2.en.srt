1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,600
You must have been at the misty edge
so long that you lost track of time.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,480
It's the eighth month. It's time
for the devil-hunting ceremony.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,600
Any woman who fails
the devil-hunter selection

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,320
must step down to become a laborer.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,480
Would I have to carry feces
and urine like the laborer ladies?

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,440
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,160
The bird was killed.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
Goddess Som must be displeased with this.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
- Cut their tongues.
- Cut their tongues.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
Don't come closer.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,040
Your wrongdoing
will be judged by Goddess Som.

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,840
Som Po, you have to pass the selection.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,880
The future of Laplae depends on you.

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,760
You need to become a devil-hunter.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,760
You need to have a daughter
and ascend as Queen of the Town.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,680
Som Po.

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,560
- Som Po.
- Mother.

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,880
- Mother.
- Som Po.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
Som Po, what's wrong?

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,360
Did you have a nightmare?

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
What's on your mind Som Po?

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,200
Sometimes,

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,640
I wonder

24
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,040
why Goddess Som is so cruel.

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,000
Talom was just a girl.

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,400
As Queen Bua said,

27
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,440
"Life for a life. Rules are rules."

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
But if you become Queen,

29
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
you could change the rule.

30
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,520
Even passing the selection

31
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,160
seems impossible.

32
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,640
Promise me Kahla.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
- If you get to be Queen--
- You'll become Queen.

34
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,920
I promise.

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll be by your side.

36
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,440
Ta ting ta ting.

37
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Ta ting ta. Yes.

38
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,480
Ta ting ta.

39
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,000
Alright. Good.

40
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,040
Tuck your toes in.

41
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,440
Tuck them in. Good.

42
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,360
Beautiful.

43
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,600
That's good. Beautiful.

44
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
Do we really need to copulate
with the devils in this position?

45
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,280
It must be a position
that arouses the devils.

46
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,280
Goddess Som.

47
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
Does this truly arouse them?
The devils are indeed perverse.

48
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,680
Just do it Fuangfah.

49
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
This is the position

50
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,720
that offers you
the best chance to have a daughter.

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,760
And that's the sole purpose

52
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,000
of hunting devils.

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,640
During intercourse,

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,200
you must maintain a steady mind.

55
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360
Do not be swayed by emotions.

56
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,760
Think of Goddess Som.

57
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
Yes.

58
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,160
I can take it no more.

59
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,600
What's the matter Som Po?

60
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,120
- My leg.
- Does it hurt?

61
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,160
Let me help.

62
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,720
- It hurts.
- Let me give you a massage.

63
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Are you feeling better?

64
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,960
This year,
we will surely see changes in Laplae.

65
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,120
Are you referring to the queen's position?

66
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,920
That’s right. The queen’s daughter
is unfit. I speak honestly.

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Do not speak so. It makes me worried.

68
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
What will become of Laplae
if the royal lineage of the queen changes?

69
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,360
I have considered it,

70
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,160
and every woman who makes it
to this round has an equal chance.

71
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,560
Either you or I could become Queen.

72
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,960
I bow to you Queen Pakkad.

73
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,000
I just hope I don't have to
become a laborer. That's good enough.

74
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,280
About the queen position, I think Som Po…

75
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,200
If Som Po were half as capable as Kahla,
there might be some hope.

76
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,640
But now, she's not even close.

77
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,200
Did you see her dance moves?

78
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,800
If I were a devil,
I would rather become a monk.

79
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,840
It’s really annoying.

81
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,520
- I'm scared.
- Look at that.

82
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960
- That one.
- I'm scared.

83
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,880
It's scary.

84
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,640
These are illustrations
of various copulation positions.

85
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,880
You must remember them well.

86
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,520
- I'm scared.
- Look at it.

87
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,280
I'm scared.

88
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,200
Be quiet.

89
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
Do not find amusement in this.

90
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you aware of

91
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
the sacrifices your mothers made

92
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,080
for you to be born

93
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,600
and for Laplae to endure to this day?

94
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,320
Now it's your turn.

95
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,120
Don't waste your mother's blood,

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,280
sweat, and tears.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,560
Teacher Bu-Nga.

98
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,760
How is copulation
considered a form of sacrifice?

99
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,400
It’s painful, it’s torturous,

100
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,799
like being stabbed with a knife.

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
Then, we should choose a devil

102
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,880
with a small Ding-Dong, right?

103
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,360
What's better
between a small Ding-Dong and a large one?

104
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,640
Does it affect our chance of pregnancy
or the gender of the child?

105
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,000
Nevertheless,
being stabbed with a smaller knife

106
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,320
would give a better chance
of survival than with a larger one,

107
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,120
right?

108
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,280
- Right?
- Alright, be quiet.

109
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,680
What did I tell you?

110
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,960
What are the qualities
of a devil we should copulate with?

111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,040
He should appear strong and vigorous,
with a broad chest,

112
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
firm buttocks, and not be short.

113
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,360
Indeed Pakkad.

114
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,840
I'm so pleased.

115
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,320
Alright, tomorrow is the selection day.

116
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,880
Bow to Goddess Som

117
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,000
and seek her blessing.

118
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Do your best.

119
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,560
Sathu.

120
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,160
Som Po.

121
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Aw.

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,480
Som Po, what's wrong?

123
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,320
You are too nervous.
That's not good. Don't overthink things.

124
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,560
It's alright if you don't pass.
It's in the hands of Goddess Som.

125
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,760
If that is so, I'm dying to know
what Goddess Som has for me.

126
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,160
If she doesn't want me to be Queen,

127
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,360
I won't need to try hard

128
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
and get eliminated.

129
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,000
I know I am of no worth.

130
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,600
I may cause Mother to be demoted.

131
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,120
I feel so ashamed that I want to die.

132
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,240
If I take my own life,

133
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,680
will Goddess Som be angry with me?

134
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
Som Po.

135
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,640
You're overthinking.

136
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,440
Remain calm. Alright?

137
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
Come on, sit here.

138
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,040
Do not fret.

139
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,160
Breathe in. Breathe out.

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
Are you feeling better?

141
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,800
Som Po.

142
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,200
My mother taught me

143
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,520
that squeezing your hand like this
can alleviate your distress.

144
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
Don’t talk like that.

145
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,560
It concerns me.

146
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,640
I don’t know

147
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,600
what Goddess Som has planned,

148
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
but what I am sure of is,

149
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,800
that if you are determined and persistent,

150
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,120
Queen Bua will be pleased.

151
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,320
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

152
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,720
- Here it is Song Po.
- What are you doing?

153
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,080
I want Som Po to inhale
the scent of the Cananga flower.

154
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,760
Its fragrance will help her relax.

155
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,320
Here it is.

156
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm feeling better now.

157
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Thank you, both of you.

158
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,080
Chan.

159
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,760
Our railway tracks

160
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,880
need to traverse this waterway.

161
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,960
I’ve heard people say

162
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,640
there’s a hidden town nearby.

163
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,560
It’s just a tale Henry.
There’s nothing there.

164
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,760
Does that mean it doesn't exist?

165
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,160
No, it doesn't.

166
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Alright.

167
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,920
Alright. Spread wider.

168
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,920
I'm so nervous.

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
Me too.

170
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,000
How about you Somsook?

171
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,160
For the first round of sexual
attribute selection, I am very confident

172
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,360
because I am beautiful
both inside and out.

173
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,240
How beautiful!

174
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,960
You pass. Take it easy.

175
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,880
Next person.

176
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,840
Stay still. Spread wider.

177
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,720
Don't tremble.

178
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,680
Stay still.

179
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,200
Your skin is smooth,

180
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,760
your legs are well-shaped,
and your hips are nicely rounded.

181
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,480
Your sexual attributes meet the standards

182
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,080
and are considered auspicious.

183
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,320
You pass.

184
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,840
Yeah! Thank you Goddess Som.

185
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,840
What did I tell you?

186
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,640
Next person.

187
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,160
It's my turn now.

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,480
Som Po. Som Po, wake up.

189
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,000
Som Po. Som Po, wake up.

190
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,800
- What's wrong Kahla?
- We're late.

191
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,080
I want to wash my face
to refresh myself first.

192
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,520
You go ahead first.
I’ll catch up with you later.

193
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,360
Then I'll go first. Hurry up.

194
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,480
Next person.

195
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,480
Wider.

196
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,440
My child is so skilled at weaving.

197
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,560
Goddess Som

198
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
will surely show you favor.

199
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,400
Really?

200
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
You have a mole in a private area,

201
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,240
which is considered inauspicious.

202
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,320
You do not pass.

203
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Teacher, please help me.

204
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,240
Teacher, please help me.

205
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,920
Teacher.

206
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,920
Where is Som Po?

207
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,000
She's on her way.

208
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
She hasn't woken up yet?
Or has she already fled?

209
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
She probably knows
she won’t make it anyway.

210
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,120
Next person.

211
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,400
Don't cry.

212
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,400
Don't cry.

213
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,360
My daughter.

214
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,640
You slept in on such an important day.
How can I not worry?

215
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,600
I apologize Mother.

216
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
I just wanted to wash my face.

217
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,800
Are you sure
you've already washed your face?

218
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,360
Freshen yourself up
and be more elegant. Follow me.

219
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,400
Don't worry.

220
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,640
Do what you can.

221
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,920
Do your best. That's enough.

222
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
Thank you Teacher.

223
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Mother, I pass.

224
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,880
Hurry up. Go.

225
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,800
I bow to you.

226
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,800
I bow to you.

227
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,200
How did you teach your daughter

228
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,880
to be so proficient?

229
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,560
While I was on duty at the misty edge,

230
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,280
you helped me take care of her.

231
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,000
I have to thank you.

232
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,640
It's alright.

233
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,080
All Laplae daughters are my daughters.

234
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
Som Po, what's wrong?

235
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,320
She's fine.

236
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,160
She's just nervous.

237
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,160
If you're going to see Kahla,
you can go now.

238
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,840
Som Po, you're the last one. Come here.

239
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,720
Alright. Spread your legs.

240
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,480
Hurry up. It's already late.

241
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,840
Let's go Som Po.

242
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,880
How is Baitong?

243
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,600
I heard she suddenly fell ill.

244
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,120
I will pray with Goddess Som

245
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,760
for your daughter's swift recovery.

246
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
If you need anything, just let me know.

247
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,760
Thank you Queen Bua.

248
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,920
It is my duty.

249
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,760
Your daughter will get better.

250
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,680
Please rest assured.

251
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,800
You’re very kind.

252
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,240
Thank you Queen Bua.

253
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,760
The Bean Test is about to start.

254
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,000
You must arrive
before the incense burns out.

255
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,000
Don’t let the beans fall.

256
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,240
Twenty ladies
participated in the first test,

257
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,280
and 15 of them
meet the auspicious criteria.

258
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,400
The next test
will be a pelvic examination.

259
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,560
I wish all of you the best of luck.

260
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
Let it begin.

261
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
Oh.

262
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,720
You've already failed.

263
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,720
‪Stop.

264
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
- Come here.
- I can't.

265
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,840
- Come here.
- Let me go.

266
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
Be careful. Don't let it fall.

267
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,880
- Kahla, hurry up.
- Hurry up.

268
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

269
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,000
- Hurry up.
- Be careful.

270
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,480
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

271
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,280
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

272
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

273
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
- I'm going first.
- Let me go first.

274
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
- Hurry up.
- Do you understand?

275
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,560
My beans.

276
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,480
- No.
- You failed. Come down.

277
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,000
No. Please let me go. I'm not going.

278
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm scared.

279
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,120
- Hurry up.
- Be careful.

280
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,800
- Be careful.
- Hurry up.

281
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,000
- Be careful.
- Som Po, hurry up.

282
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,960
Don't worry. I've got your back.

283
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,000
- Hurry up.
- Som Po.

284
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,800
Pull it.

285
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,680
You're almost there Som Po.

286
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,880
Take it and come down.

287
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,960
- Take it.
- You go next.

288
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,240
Be careful.

289
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,040
- Come down.
- Be careful.

290
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
‪Go ahead.

291
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Oh.

292
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,040
One, two, three, four, five.

293
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,440
Oh.

294
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,440
- Let me go first.
- I'll go first.

295
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,240
Let me go first.

296
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
I want to finish first.

297
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,160
I want to finish first.

298
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,960
‪Hey.

299
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,560
You're eliminated.

300
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,280
- Let me try one more time.
- Go.

301
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,440
Why has no one come back yet?

302
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,360
Wait for me.

303
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,720
Here they come.

304
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,920
Fuangfah.

305
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,560
Time is running out.

306
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,840
Som Po, the incense.

307
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,640
- We have to go now.
- Let's go.

308
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,720
Let's go Song Po. The time is almost out.

309
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,840
We're almost there.

310
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,960
Almost there.

311
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,800
Time's up.

312
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,120
We made it.

313
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,560
Now, ten ladies remain

314
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,840
to undergo the devil seduction
test tomorrow.

315
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,840
The judges will evaluate based on wit

316
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,120
and sexual arousal skills.

317
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
Some of you are almost ready to confront

318
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,960
the devils outside.

319
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,920
But when you are in the outside world,

320
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,200
always remember

321
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,200
how vile the devils are.

322
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,440
- Come on.
- What is that?

323
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,160
Those devils are just ignorant fools.

324
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,880
<i>They lack understanding,</i>

325
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,560
<i>- are foolish,</i>
- Let's drink.

326
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,480
<i>spend their days drinking, and are rude,</i>

327
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,760
<i>coarse,</i>

328
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,040
<i>vile, and obscene.</i>

329
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,040
<i>Remember that.</i>

330
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

331
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,840
The dark stream flows from the north,

332
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,480
originating from a small town

333
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,080
surrounded by a narrow canal.

334
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,560
The dust and water steam

335
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
create a dense mist wall,

336
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,880
shielding it

337
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,280
from any intruder.

338
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,680
I remember

339
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,400
that I met

340
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,960
a young woman,

341
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,720
the most beautiful in the forest,

342
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,440
and then suddenly,

343
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,360
she vanished into the mist.

344
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,040
Those were nymphs.

345
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,040
It would be great if they came here.
I'd make all of them my wives.

346
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,040
- How is that?
- Wow.

347
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
That was not a nymph.

348
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,720
She was a Laplae lady.

349
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,160
What did you say?

350
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,280
It was you.

351
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,920
At that time,
I didn't believe that Laplae was real,

352
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,360
so I followed her.

353
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,280
She was truly beautiful,

354
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,000
but it turned out
she was a wicked monster.

355
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,160
Cut the nonsense.

356
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,800
You will only frighten the porters.

357
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
These stories are just passed down
through generations.

358
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,960
We don’t even know their origin.

359
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,560
But this is my own story.

360
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,120
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

361
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,440
At that time, I was young.
I overestimated myself.

362
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,920
I thought I was stronger

363
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,160
and smarter than anyone else,
just like you,

364
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,640
Bangkok man.

365
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,080
I knew too much,

366
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,400
so they took my eyes.

367
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,680
I knew too much, so they took my eyes.

368
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,960
Shall we go?

369
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm scared.

370
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,680
I'm scared.

371
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,080
You shouldn’t go,

372
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,960
do not go.

373
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,680
That's scary.

374
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,200
Homage to the goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

375
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,480
Homage to the goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

376
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,960
Homage to the goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

377
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,920
Homage to the goddess,
glorious and radiant, in reverence.

378
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,600
<i>Homage to the goddess,</i>
<i>glorious and radiant, in reverence.</i>

379
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,080
From this moment,
these will be your garments.

380
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,720
They're heavy.

381
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,240
I don't want to stay here.
I want to go and hunt devils.

382
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,000
I did it before.

383
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,880
But I ended up here just like you.

384
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,840
There is no use in going.

385
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,640
If your child is a devil,
you’ll suffer in vain during childbirth.

386
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,560
Our fortune only extends this far.

387
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,440
It has already been decreed
by Goddess Som.

388
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,720
And why must Goddess Som
be the one to decide for us?

389
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I want to make the decision myself.

390
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,440
My Goodness. Dokfai, I’ll slap your mouth.

391
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,560
How could you say that?
You'll end up like Talom.

392
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,600
Continue working.

393
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,280
Faster.

394
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,040
From now on,
you'll be judged by the three judges,

395
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,000
Khaokum,

396
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Chuanchom,

397
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,440
and Chankrapor.

398
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,120
The devil seduction test
is a simulated scenario

399
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,120
for encountering devils outside.

400
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,560
You should know how to act
and how to seduce them.

401
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,480
Use all the courage

402
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,840
and ingenuity you have

403
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,159
to benefit our land.

404
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,679
I'll go first.

405
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
Oops.

406
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,920
She looks so good.

407
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,880
Thank you.

408
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,400
Som Po, it's your turn.

409
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,280
Oh, this flower is so beautiful.

410
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,360
Som Po, get yourself together.

411
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,680
You have to focus.

412
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,680
If I was a real devil, what would you do?

413
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,000
Spider!

414
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,120
What?

415
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,960
Som Po. Come here.

416
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,160
Stop. What's wrong?

417
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,080
It's a spider.

418
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,480
- It's a spider.
- Alright. Go.

419
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,600
The selection process has concluded.

420
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,440
Now it's time to announce
the list of this year's devil-hunters.

421
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,560
The first person to be selected is

422
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,600
Kahla.

423
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,080
Next is

424
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,400
Somsook.

425
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,680
Rampoei.

426
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,680
Rampoei.

427
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Chaba.

428
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,400
And the last one…

429
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,840
Songpeep.

430
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,440
So, the Queen will have to be
demoted to a lower rank, won't she?

431
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,160
She has made merit all along.
Why must she be so unfortunate?

432
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,120
How can my daughter Pakkad not pass?

433
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,640
The last two rounds
were judged by the judges.

434
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,960
What was the criteria?

435
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,320
Yes, I also want to know

436
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
why my daughter didn't pass.

437
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,560
Mine too. Can the judges truly see?

438
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

439
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,680
I heard that Pakkad didn't pass

440
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,680
because Chankapor was mad

441
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,040
that Pakkad scolded Talom and her mother.

442
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,600
- What's happennng?
- Really?

443
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,280
- Really?
- What are you talking about Payom?

444
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,960
I've heard that
you are in an affair with her mother.

445
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,680
Huh?

446
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,760
How can someone like this be a judge?

447
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,800
Really?

448
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,960
I didn't do that.

449
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,840
I demand a re-evaluation.

450
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,960
Remove Chankapor from the panel of judges.

451
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,880
- We don't want Chankapor.
- We don't want Chankapor.

452
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,840
- We don't want Chankapor.
- We don't want Chankapor.

453
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,760
- We don't want Chankapor.
- We don't want Chankapor.

454
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,880
- We don't want Chankapor.
- We don't want Chankapor.

455
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,440
- We don't want Chankapor.
- We don't want Chankapor.

456
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,240
<i>If the queen’s lineage changes,</i>

457
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,480
what will become
of our statuses, Lady Healer?

458
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,640
- Re-evaluation.
- Re-evaluation.

459
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,280
Given that this year’s devil-hunters

460
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,840
have the chance to become Queen,

461
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,640
and that the queen must communicate
with Goddess Som,

462
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,320
I would like to propose that

463
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,360
the final selection
of this year's devil-hunters

464
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,280
should be judged by Goddess Som.

465
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,720
What do you think?

466
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,040
I agree. Let Goddess Som decide.

467
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,800
- Let Goddess Som decide.
- Let Goddess Som decide.

468
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,920
- Let Goddess Som decide.
- Let Goddess Som decide.

469
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,080
- Let Goddess Som decide.
- Let Goddess Som decide.

470
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,360
In that case, let it be so.

471
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,320
Goddess Som will make the selection
with her pure heart.

472
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,360
Tonight, every young woman
who failed to pass the final round

473
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,720
must meditate

474
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,280
and pray to Goddess Som until dawn.

475
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Then, we'll summon Goddess Som.

476
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,600
We still have hope.

477
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,320
Som Po, let's do our best.

478
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,880
What are you waiting for?

479
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,600
Go to the training house
and prepare yourselves.

480
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,200
<i>Focus your minds on Goddess Som</i>
<i>to receive her guidance</i>

481
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,280
<i>on which young woman is most suitable.</i>

482
