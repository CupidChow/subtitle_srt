00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,880
THIS DRAMA IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,880
CHARACTERS, PLACES AND EVENTS
ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,920
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED
FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Who is the devil

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,200
and the two women here?

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,760
My father,

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,720
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
my mother,

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,120
and my sister.

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
I’ve never seen your mother.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,400
I don't know

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,280
who my mother is either.

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,440
In the grave, there was only a log.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,120
What truth are you

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,520
and Lady Bongkod hiding?

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,080
<i>Couldn't your mother</i>

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,560
come up with a more clever plan than this?

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
If I had a mother like you,

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,520
I wouldn’t return either.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,200
If you won’t help your own child,
then I will go save my wife myself.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Back off!

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
I'm going to find the Town of Mist.

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,280
Step back

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
if you don’t want Bua’s child to die.

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
How could Som Po be there?

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,560
Am is not looking good now.

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,440
Excuse me, I’ve traveled a long way…

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
Drink some water.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,080
Slowly.

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,240
Slowly.

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,440
Thank you.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,600
- Well--
- It's alright.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,800
Have you…

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
Have you been living here for a long time?

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,480
And where is your twin?

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,920
Is she still in that Town of Mist?

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,280
And…

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
how about other people?

40
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,280
Don't you remember?

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,560
Have we met before?

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
For almost 20 years,

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
am I the only one who still remembers?

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Mm…

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,720
People of Laplae…

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
You are all

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
heartless evils.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,640
Deceiving men into infatuation,

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
when all you ever wanted was daughters.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
Daughters?

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,760
If it was a son,

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,600
you discarded him
without a second thought.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,440
My goodness. The Queen's daughter.

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,320
Aunt Angkab.

55
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,360
Yeehub, you're here too?

56
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,600
We are too.

57
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,000
You went to rescue Kahla, why did you
end up with the Queen’s daughter?

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,840
Her mother tricked us,
hiding Kahla somewhere else.

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,400
So devious.

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,440
If Som Po
hadn’t offered herself as a hostage,

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,480
we probably wouldn’t
have made it out alive.

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760
Hide her in the cave.

63
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,720
Cover her head

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
so she won’t know the way to our hideout.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,480
Aunt…

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,400
Foolish!

67
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,680
That’s why the rebels took her.

68
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000
Som Po isn’t foolish.

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
She went with them willingly.

70
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
She might be using herself

71
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,720
as a bargaining chip
to ensure the safety of her friend.

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,920
Go find Som Po.

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
If you don’t find her, don’t come back.

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,320
Yes my Queen.

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,280
What did you and Mother argue about?

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
Why did it escalate like this?

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,040
Your mother has deceived people,

78
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,200
deceived the whole town,

79
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,880
claiming divine power and merits.

80
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,120
Is Goddess Som truly the one
who controls the town’s destiny,

81
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,640
or is it just a ploy

82
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,600
for someone to retain power?

83
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
What makes you believe that?

84
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,600
You should know deep down.

85
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,480
Did you get to hunt the devil

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,080
by yourself,

87
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,680
or was it your mother pulling the strings?

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,480
What we see

89
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,440
may not be what’s real.

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,080
What's worse,

91
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,160
is that she’s been deceiving for so long

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
that we don't even know
what’s true anymore.

93
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,240
I don’t know

94
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,880
how to handle this right now,

95
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,240
but the first thing I believe we should do

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,560
is bring Kahla back.

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Why don't you suggest
that my mother trade hostages?

98
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,160
Me for Kahla?

99
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,600
I think it’s a good idea,

100
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,400
but the real issue is,

101
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,560
who will we send

102
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,960
to negotiate with them?

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,960
I’ll go myself.

104
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Think carefully Goya.

105
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,840
Going to deliver the message

106
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,320
is essentially revealing yourself

107
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,240
as a rebel.

108
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
If they reject the offer,

109
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,120
you could be killed.

110
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,559
<i>If you rush in and propose the deal,</i>

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,000
<i>their side might panic.</i>

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,840
<i>The messenger might not survive.</i>

113
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,679
<i>I suggest we let someone from their side</i>

114
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,320
<i>escort you to meet with the Queen.</i>

115
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,360
I have an urgent message
from Lady Guardian.

116
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
I need to deliver it directly to the Queen

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
regarding the hostage exchange.

118
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
A hostage exchange, is that it?

119
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,840
Yes, Kahla for Som Po.

120
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
At the time when the sun
is at its peak tomorrow,

121
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,080
meet at the open field

122
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,960
at the foot of the hill
on the eastern side of the sacred well.

123
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,720
The Queen must come with Kahla,
just the two of you,

124
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,560
no one else.

125
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Lady Guardian will come with Som Po,
also just the two of them.

126
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,200
Nonsense!

127
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
If anything happens to me,

128
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,240
do you think Som Po will be safe?

129
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,400
<i>They won’t dare harm the messenger,</i>
<i>because Som Po</i>

130
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,520
<i>could be in danger at any moment.</i>

131
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,520
Fine.

132
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,040
I will go with Kahla, just the two of us.

133
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,560
<i>And see with your own eyes</i>
<i>that Kahla is truly safe.</i>

134
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,520
Good,

135
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
then let me see for myself
that Kahla is unharmed.

136
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,600
Don’t forget, tomorrow,

137
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
when the sun is at its peak.

138
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,520
I hope you won’t do anything
that puts Som Po’s life at risk.

139
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,600
Everything is going as you said.

140
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,320
They agreed to our plan

141
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,480
and will come tomorrow.

142
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
But…

143
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,320
I don’t believe they’ll come
with just two people.

144
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,640
Right, I don’t believe it either.

145
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,640
Then hide weapons on yourself.

146
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,160
Even if we hide weapons,

147
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
the Queen has a large force.

148
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,600
She’ll likely bring them to surround us.

149
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,680
If anything happens,
just threaten to kill me.

150
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,040
Mother.

151
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,200
If anything seems off,

152
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,640
know that the first to die will be Som Po.

153
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
You speak of killing
without a hint of guilt.

154
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,080
No wonder you’ve caused such chaos,

155
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,080
dividing the people into two groups.

156
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,160
Only those who thrive on misfortune

157
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,320
would have such thoughts
that would drag Laplae down.

158
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,040
What is fortune?

159
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,800
What does it mean to be good?

160
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,520
Or is being good

161
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,480
defined by following
the system your family created?

162
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,560
Perhaps those
who truly determine the fate of the town

163
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,760
are beyond such systems.

164
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
Think carefully

165
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,960
about why the town is in such turmoil,

166
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,760
to the point
of using a child as a hostage.

167
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,000
Who is to blame?

168
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,840
If we had stayed within the old ways,

169
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,720
none of this would have happened.

170
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,400
I wouldn't have won the people's hearts

171
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,920
if they hadn't been suffering for so long.

172
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,360
Open your eyes and ears, and listen

173
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,360
to the hearts of those who have no power.

174
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,080
If you're done talking, hand over Som Po.

175
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,960
I owe you nothing anymore.

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,800
I knew all along you weren’t honest.

177
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,640
It’s disappointing,

178
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,560
after all the good we once built together.

179
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,560
Now,

180
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,800
you walk toward evil, blinded by it.

181
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,080
The good you once did

182
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,080
is no longer enough
to pull you from this abyss.

183
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,920
Goddess Som

184
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,760
will judge you herself.

185
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,200
It won’t be long.
The truth will come to light,

186
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,560
and the whole town will know of your lies.

187
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,520
Kill them!

188
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Traitor to the grace of Goddess Som!

189
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,840
Let's go. Go!

190
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,760
I'm so happy

191
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,560
that you're safe.

192
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
I'm so happy too.

193
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,680
I thought I would
never see you again Mother.

194
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
They told me you broke the rules
by going outside.

195
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,360
Why did you go out back then?

196
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,760
I saw Anchan.

197
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
Mother?

198
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,760
I saw someone who looked like you

199
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,040
when I went out devil-hunting.

200
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,960
I thought I was mistaken,

201
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,720
but the person I saw

202
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,680
was Aunt Anchan, your younger sister?

203
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,440
Yes, that's right.

204
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,800
I came back to town and hurried

205
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,560
to dig up Anchan’s grave.

206
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,800
I found a log instead.

207
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,080
Why did they replace

208
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,880
Anchan’s body with a log?

209
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,600
Oh, Kahla, how are you?

210
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,160
Are you hungry? Thirsty?

211
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
Did anything happen to you?
I was really worried.

212
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
And the baby, how is the baby?

213
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,840
Wait, what? Oh, you miss your father?
Oh, come here, come here.

214
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,640
Oh, my child, how are you doing?

215
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,200
Whoa, the baby is still fine.

216
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,319
That’s good.

217
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,000
You know, my mother-in-law

218
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,240
seems to like me a lot.

219
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,880
She must've accepted me as her son-in-law.

220
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,079
What son-in-law?

221
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,240
Well, I’ve slept with you.

222
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,560
I’m the father
of the child you’re carrying right?

223
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm your husband, remember?

224
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,600
Now, your mother is like my mother too.

225
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,600
Kahla, you brought the devil
into the town.

226
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,000
We might be in danger because of this.

227
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,560
You have to take him out of the town.

228
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,000
During the hostage exchange,

229
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,240
wasn’t it that very Devil Min,
who made Queen Bua retreat?

230
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
Maybe

231
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,360
what we were taught to believe
isn’t entirely true.

232
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,360
I believe that there are
both good and bad devils.

233
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,760
When change comes to our Laplae,

234
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
it could open the way

235
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,520
for good devils to join us.

236
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,200
We shouldn't have to push away
our child who is not a daughter.

237
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,400
We must raise our children,

238
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,840
no matter what gender they are.

239
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,080
Exactly.

240
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,040
Our town must no longer have foolish rules
that hurt our people’s hearts.

241
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,800
For the sake of our children,
regardless of gender.

242
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,240
Why don’t

243
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,000
we break these beliefs?

244
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,800
The Queen’s power

245
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,480
rests on the beliefs of the townspeople.

246
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,800
If we expose

247
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,000
the Queen’s flaws to them,

248
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,440
the town can change.

249
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
And how will we do that?

250
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,080
I think we need to stir up
the people at the well

251
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,080
and let the fire spread on its own.

252
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,040
What kind of story will we spin?

253
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,480
We can use the story about the Queen lying
about Aunt Anchan’s death.

254
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,920
How could her body
suddenly be replaced by a log?

255
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,680
That’s all it takes, people will start
to question what the Queen is hiding.

256
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,560
Alright.

257
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,840
It’s alright, take your time.

258
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,160
- I--
- Khun Luang,

259
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,440
a letter from the authorities Sir.

260
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,960
Go announce to the caravan soldiers
who went ahead

261
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
that we’ll halt the smaller troop movement

262
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,960
and begin planning

263
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,320
to search for
the Ngiao’s weapons stockpile,

264
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
as per the authorities' orders.

265
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,920
Yes Sir.

266
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,920
Alright.

267
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,520
I must apologize

268
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
for not remembering anything.

269
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,760
It’s alright.

270
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
Alright.

271
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,800
Father, did you know a woman
around the aunt’s age?

272
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,040
Why are you bringing this up?

273
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
Come on, eat your food.

274
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,640
I found your service records.

275
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
You were stationed here
a year before I was born.

276
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,560
My mother,

277
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,560
she’s from Laplae, isn’t she?

278
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,160
Yes.

279
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,520
But you’re not going to meet your mother.

280
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,200
Why can’t I meet my own mother?

281
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,160
We’re here now.

282
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,720
So what? You want to
drag Am back in to die again?

283
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,760
If you weren’t a coward,
maybe you never truly loved my mother.

284
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
But I’m not like you.

285
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,920
The love I have for Som Po is immense.

286
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,960
It's enough

287
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,680
that I’m willing
to risk my life to find her.

288
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,960
And how do you know I never did?

289
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,080
Why were you so foolish,
getting yourself captured by the rebels?

290
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,200
You’ve ruined the whole plan.

291
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,960
If you die, what will I do?

292
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,520
My Queen,

293
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,280
they found this at Lady Pua’s house.

294
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,120
Why didn’t you listen to me

295
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,760
and take the purifying antidote?

296
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,120
Do you want to betray us
and become a rebel?

297
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,880
Or did Kahla

298
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,400
fill your head with these twisted ideas,

299
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,560
making you refuse the antidote?

300
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
And did you take it Mother?

301
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
I know

302
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,560
you didn’t take
the purifying antidote either,

303
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,280
or you wouldn’t have been able
to tell me about the outside world.

304
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,560
Does that mean
you’ve betrayed everyone else as well?

305
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,440
What are you hiding from everyone?

306
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,640
If you're truly lying to me and everyone,

307
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,200
there’s no need to fear
the rebels destroying our town.

308
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,560
One day, Goddess Som herself
will destroy our family.

309
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,040
<i>Stay still, Som Po.</i>

310
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,480
Can you be more still?

311
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Alright.

312
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
That’s enough Som Po.

313
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,520
Just a pinch will do.

314
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,000
If there’s too much,

315
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,480
it could cause a big explosion.

316
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,200
Is that all?

317
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,080
I can just breathe, and it will be gone.

318
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Here.

319
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,640
Wow, the light is so beautiful.

320
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,520
Just a pinch is all it takes

321
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,520
to create a beautiful flare,
like the one you see.

322
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,920
But if there’s too much gunpowder,

323
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,960
when it touches fire,

324
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,520
it can cause a powerful explosion.

325
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,760
An explosion?

326
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,680
What is that?

327
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,960
An explosion

328
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,400
is something used

329
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,600
to break apart large things,

330
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,240
like when I used dynamite to blast rocks

331
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,000
to clear the way for the railway.

332
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,600
There…

333
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,320
Would you like some fresh vegetables?

334
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,240
- Would you like some vegetables?
- You can take a look first.

335
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,800
Hey,

336
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,800
do you have any saltpeter and sulfur?

337
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
What do you want them for?

338
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,680
Well…

339
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,360
What are you doing Chan?

340
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
Why are you making a bomb
in the middle of the forest?

341
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,920
This bomb

342
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
is the same method
the construction crew used to blast rocks

343
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,640
to clear the way for the railway.

344
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,800
It will help me open a path
into the Misty Town.

345
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,360
Think carefully
and get a hold of yourself.

346
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,960
If you die in that mist before you get
to see your wife’s face again,

347
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,320
how would that be?

348
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,400
Consider it carefully

349
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,520
and find a safer way.

350
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,640
Alright?

351
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,960
I’m not a coward like you Father.

352
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,960
Thank you.

353
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,280
So, they said Lady Guardian
is still alive.

354
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,320
Where do you think she is now?

355
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,280
I don’t know. Didn’t she go
and form a rebel group outside the town?

356
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,400
But I wonder,

357
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,840
why is someone who was punished
by Goddess Som still alive?

358
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,240
Or…

359
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,560
maybe she didn’t do anything wrong?

360
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
That’s the thing.

361
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
I think if she survived,

362
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,880
it must be due to her great virtue
and her merits.

363
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,840
Yes.

364
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,200
Or… is she actually the Queen?

365
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,280
- Hey?
- Oh.

366
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,720
Songpeep, be quiet! Don’t say that.

367
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,000
Or maybe the Queen and Lady Guardian
are fighting over the Queen's position?

368
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,720
What do you think?

369
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,360
Right? The town has never been so chaotic.

370
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,840
It started when the Queen’s daughter
got to go devil-hunting.

371
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,240
Who would have thought
she would pass the test?

372
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,840
Or did the Queen cheat to help her child?

373
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,760
- Really?
- Is it possible to cheat?

374
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh.

375
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,760
- Really?
- That can't be.

376
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,840
I think the reason
Lady Guardian didn't die

377
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,080
is because she didn't do anything wrong.

378
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,760
A servant secretly told me

379
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,240
that the Queen
and Lady Guardian had a fight

380
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,000
because Lady Guardian found that,
in her sister’s grave,

381
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,320
there was only a log.

382
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,560
- Where did the body go?
- Huh?

383
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,200
It’s very strange.

384
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,400
- It's very strange.
- Where did the body go?

385
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,920
How is that possible?

386
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Right?

387
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,440
Oh!

388
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,640
There's just a log.

389
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,840
Why is it like that? It’s very strange.

390
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
We can’t just let it be like this.

391
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,120
The Queen must explain.

392
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,360
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

393
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,920
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

394
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,800
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

395
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,200
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

396
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,360
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

397
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
The villagers are protesting vigorously,

398
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,360
accusing you of unjust judgment

399
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,960
and mistreatment of Lady Guardian.

400
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,920
I think if this continues,

401
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,280
it won't be good
for the stability of the town.

402
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,920
I will prove myself

403
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,440
to the people of the town

404
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,080
that I did not punish the wrong person.

405
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,360
I will let Goddess Som be the judge.

406
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,160
I will stay here until morning

407
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,040
so everyone can see for themselves,

408
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,520
unlike some who escaped
by breaking out of prison.

409
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,240
This way, the town can remove its doubt.

410
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,680
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

411
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,440
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

412
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,080
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

413
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,000
Listen!

414
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
We won't listen to you.

415
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,960
Yes. Where is Anchan's body?

416
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,480
Why deceive people with a log?

417
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,800
- We want the truth.
- The truth!

418
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,760
- We want the truth.
- Tell us the truth!

419
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,520
- We want the truth.
- Be quiet!

420
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,040
If you want to know the truth, be quiet.

421
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,160
Tonight, to prove that

422
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,560
the accusations
made by bad people are false,

423
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,400
the Queen will prove herself
at the Moon Square.

424
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,920
- Tell us the truth!
- The truth!

425
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,440
- Tell us the truth!
- The truth!

426
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,760
- Tell us the truth!
- The truth!

427
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,920
- Tell us the truth!
- The truth!

428
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,880
Big news!

429
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,440
Tonight, the Queen will prove herself

430
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,680
at the Moon Square.

431
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,120
Huh? Moon Square?

432
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,120
Why?

433
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,520
How can she prove herself
at the Moon Square?

434
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,840
The Moon Square is where wrongdoers
are judged by Goddess Som.

435
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,280
It is believed that
if the person is truly guilty,

436
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,880
Goddess Som will send
the Mist Demon to punish them to death.

437
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,400
Does this Goddess Som you speak of

438
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,159
really exist?

439
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,719
Whether Goddess Som exists or not,

440
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,199
no one knows for sure.

441
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,080
But the Mist Demon is real.

442
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,639
I want to see the Mist Demon.

443
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,920
Really?

444
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,320
Can you take me there?

445
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,680
Goddess Som, I mean no disrespect,

446
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,440
but if you truly exist,

447
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,520
I ask that you judge right and wrong

448
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,600
justly.

449
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,840
- Look at the Queen.
- Yes.

450
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,440
Nothing happened to the Queen.

451
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,360
The Queen was not punished.

452
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,280
The Queen is innocent.

453
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
- I bow to you.
- I bow to you.

454
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
- I bow to you.
- I bow to you.

455
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,960
- I bow to you.
- I bow to you.

456
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,560
Everything has been proven,

457
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,320
the Queen is innocent

458
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,080
and truly blessed with merit.

459
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,960
She is nothing like Angkab,

460
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,160
whose deceitful heart

461
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,560
led her to escape
with the help of her accomplices.

462
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,760
They even disposed of a body

463
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,560
and created the false story about the log

464
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,200
to tarnish the Queen's reputation.

465
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,800
Only wicked people
would try to stir up chaos in the town

466
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,600
with such filthy methods.

467
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,160
I feel guilty for doubting a good person.

468
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,160
- I bow to you.
- I bow to you.

469
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,640
I am the one chosen by Goddess Som.

470
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,240
To doubt me

471
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
is no different

472
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,000
from doubting
the very existence of Goddess Som.

473
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,360
I have proven myself to everyone,

474
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,360
and I ask that no one

475
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
ever question

476
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,200
the existence of Goddess Som again.

477
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,080
<i>Radiant as the heavens</i>

478
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,240
<i>Beauty unmatched by any land or mountain</i>

479
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,440
<i>Goddess Som protects</i>

480
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,520
<i>Our homes</i>

481
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,920
<i>We, the daughters of Laplae</i>

482
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,520
<i>With hearts pure and bright</i>

483
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,040
<i>Free from danger in our blessed town</i>

484
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,360
<i>Let us be ever aware</i>
<i>of the wicked and deceitful</i>

485
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,200
<i>As harm shall not come near us</i>

486
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,440
<i>We raise our hands in reverence</i>

487
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>Honoring Goddess Som</i>

488
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,160
<i>Who shields us and drives away all harm</i>

489
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,920
<i>Keeping the daughters</i>
<i>of Laplae safe and serene</i>

490
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,240
<i>Homage to the goddess</i>

491
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,640
<i>Homage to the goddess</i>

492
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,120
- I bow to you, Goddess Som.
- I bow to you, Goddess Som.

493
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,200
- I bow to you, Goddess Som.
- I bow to you, Goddess Som.

494
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,200
The Queen wasn’t harmed
by the Mist Demon at all.

495
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,760
Now,

496
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,480
the townspeople
will regain their faith in Queen Bua,

497
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,360
and our plan
to expose the truth has failed.

498
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,320
We’ll have to think of another way.

499
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,280
Som Po.

500
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,960
Aunt.

501
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,360
Last night, did you hear
the sound of the flute?

502
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,200
You didn’t hear it either?

503
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,680
I’ve patrolled
the Misty Edge for a long time.

504
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,400
On nights when someone is judged
by Goddess Som at the Moon Square,

505
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,600
there is always the sound of a flute.

506
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,480
The Misty Edge would fall silent
throughout the night,

507
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,080
and by dawn,

508
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,240
the Mist Demon
would take the life at the Moon Square.

509
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,360
But last night,

510
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,000
there wasn’t even a whisper of the flute.

511
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,920
Are you saying…

512
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,560
my mother summoned them?

513
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,480
You should think about it.

514
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,400
I bow to you, my Queen.

515
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
What are the rebels up to now?

516
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,840
They are confused,

517
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,440
scrambling to come up with another plan.

518
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,480
You’ve done well in your duty.

519
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,040
Hey, stop!

520
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,920
Do you happen to know
how to get into the Mist?

521
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,920
NEXT EPISODE

522
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,240
If any rebel comes forward,

523
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,200
I will not hold her accountable,

524
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,360
and I will raise her status.

525
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,000
You don't want to work hard.

526
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,880
We all work hard.

527
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,720
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Chaba!

528
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,240
Som Po!

529
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,840
The flute Som Po.

530
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
