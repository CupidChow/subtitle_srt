1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,120
THIS DRAMA IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,040
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,920
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED
FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,120
I must give birth at Lady Pua’s house.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,880
- I need to go home.
- Even if I have to whip you to death,

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,160
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,760
I will take you to give birth
in Phra Nakhon.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,200
Did you meet Lady Angkab?

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,760
How could I meet my mother?

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,280
No, she's still alive.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,320
So, we planned to meet tomorrow

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,480
at the edge of the forest behind the town.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,000
There shouldn’t be many people.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,280
I'm afraid something bad
will happen to you.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,840
If you're really worried as you say,

16
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,440
you need to give me the gun.

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,760
Where are you going Kahla?

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,920
Capture her!

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,560
Let's go home.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,000
Drink this medicine,

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,240
so your wound will heal.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,600
I won't drink it…

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,200
until…

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,080
you promise me

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,520
that you won't run away from me.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,360
I promise.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,680
Som Po, what are you doing?

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
I found a rare herb.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,240
I’ll take it to Lady Healer.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
Som Po,

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
your place is in Laplae.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Don’t cling to the devil too much.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,240
You have to move on.

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm trying to move on.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
That's why it hurts.

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
In a little while,
once you enter the town,

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,760
you will drink the purifying antidote,

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,960
and all your pain will ease away.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,640
Aunt Eungpueng,

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
have you ever known love?

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I have.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,840
I love Khemkao, I love my mother,

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,880
and I love my comrades
in the Guardian Unit.

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,600
I didn't mean that kind of love.

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,680
The Training House always teaches us

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,760
that the feelings you may encounter

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
with devils in the outside world

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,080
are just illusions of infatuation.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,320
But what I learned from Teacher

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,800
and what I encountered outside

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
contradict each other.

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,960
I don’t know what to believe anymore,

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,480
nor can I tell what’s real
and what’s false.

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,880
The love you found

55
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,200
might be real Som Po,

56
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,000
but it’s not meant for us.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,120
Let's go home

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,320
and forget everything

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,160
from the outside world.

60
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
Lady Guardian.

61
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
Lady Guardian.

62
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Lady Guardian.

63
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
Kahla…

64
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
Lady Warden captured Kahla.

65
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,920
Captured? How?

66
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,520
I apologize. I don't know either.

67
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
They were waiting there

68
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,080
as if they knew beforehand.

69
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't resist.

70
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
Hurry up.

71
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,120
- Go.
- That's Kahla.

72
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,560
- Kahla.
- What is this?

73
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,040
Keep walking.

74
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,640
Go.

75
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,600
Where is Som Po?

76
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you want to know?

77
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,120
Answer me.

78
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,360
I also want to know

79
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,880
Why did you order
the execution of my mother?

80
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
Give me the answer first

81
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,400
and I'll tell you where Som Po is.

82
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
I didn't give the order to execute anyone.

83
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,160
It was Goddess Som who made the judgment.

84
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,800
And Angkab herself broke the rule.

85
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
Don't blame Goddess Som.

86
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,440
Wasn’t it you who ordered my mother
to be imprisoned and killed by the demons?

87
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
And wasn’t it because

88
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,400
my mother found out
about your wicked deeds?

89
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I've answered your question.

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,880
Now tell me

91
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,960
where Som Po is.

92
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,520
Even though you sent Aunt Eungpueng
to bring her back, she won't return.

93
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
Do you know why?

94
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,920
It’s because your daughter

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,840
is so infatuated with the devil
that she’s lost all sense

96
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
and won’t return to the town.

97
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,040
If the law is followed,

98
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,640
you’ll face punishment too.

99
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,440
Som Po will be back.

100
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
Wait and see.

101
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,480
If I had a mother like you,
I wouldn’t return either.

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
How arrogant!

103
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,880
Pudson,

104
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,240
chain her up

105
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
and call everyone here.

106
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
Yes my Queen.

107
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
Come! Stand up!

108
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
Go!

109
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,840
Whoa.

110
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,520
There's no meat at all?

111
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
Songpeep,

112
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm still wondering

113
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,080
how other people knew Kahla was back?

114
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
Who knows where the walls have ears?

115
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
- Devil!
- Devil!

116
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,800
How did you get into Laplae?

117
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,520
Tell me.

118
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,320
Tell me, or I'll stab you.

119
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,520
I'm Min.

120
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,520
I'm Kahla's friend.

121
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Kahla?

122
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,760
Is Kahla with you?

123
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,200
Hey!

124
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,360
Was it my daughter

125
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,280
who brought you into the town?

126
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,800
No,

127
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,240
I sneaked in by following her.

128
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
I am Kahla’s husband.

129
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,120
And I am the father of her child.

130
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,360
By the way,

131
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,760
where is Kahla? Isn't she here?

132
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,920
Lady Guardian!

133
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
What's happening?

134
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,360
I have an important
announcement for all of you.

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Angkab is not dead yet.

136
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,720
That’s right,

137
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,720
Angkab is not dead.

138
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,200
This should have been good news for me,

139
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,640
as I considered her a friend.

140
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,160
However…

141
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
I…

142
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,560
I must apologize to all of you.

143
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,680
I am Queen,

144
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,520
but I trusted the wrong person.

145
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Now,

146
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,280
she is no longer the Angkab
that I once knew.

147
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,000
She has violated the law

148
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,040
and set herself up
as the leader of a rebel group,

149
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,760
inciting

150
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,840
our people to go astray.

151
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,160
Those who burned the barns

152
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,200
and stole the weapons are her followers.

153
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,800
- Huh?
- She needs to be executed.

154
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,160
- She's a traitor.
- Execute her.

155
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,480
- Execute her.
- Execute her.

156
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,040
She's a traitor.

157
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,560
Goddess Som showed her mercy
by sparing her life.

158
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,000
Instead of feeling remorse,

159
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,240
she betrayed Goddess Som’s kindness
without fear of punishment.

160
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,520
I,

161
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,520
in my final duty as Queen,

162
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
will put an end to this
misguided rebel group once and for all.

163
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,120
- I bow to you.
- I bow to you.

164
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,680
- I bow to you, Goddess Som.
- I bow to you, Goddess Som.

165
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,560
Anyone who sides with Angkab,

166
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,520
turn back while you still can.

167
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,920
She won’t be able to protect you.

168
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,160
That's the traitor's daughter.

169
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,680
- You evil!
- Wicked!

170
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,360
- Execute her.
- Execute her.

171
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,880
- Kahla.
- She's an evil.

172
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,440
- She's an evil.
- Execute her.

173
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,800
- She can't do this.
- Traitor's daughter.

174
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,200
- They're both bad.
- Execute her.

175
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,600
- Execute her.
- How can you do this?

176
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,280
Let me talk to the rebels.

177
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Tell your leader,

178
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,520
if she wants Goddess Som
to spare this woman’s life,

179
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,120
turn herself in by tomorrow

180
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,160
before sunset.

181
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,520
I'll help… I'll help my wife.

182
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Where's my wife?

183
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,920
We'll help her.

184
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,400
Send him out of the town.

185
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,400
Wait. Let go of me. Wait!

186
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,160
Listen to me.

187
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,440
What is your plan?
How are you going to rescue her?

188
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,480
Hm?

189
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,680
Or are you planning to surrender yourself?

190
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,280
What is your decision?

191
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,440
Hey.

192
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,680
Lady Guardian.

193
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,480
Lady Som Po.

194
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,320
I’ve been assigned to escort you
to the Queen’s house

195
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,320
because the situation
in the town is unstable.

196
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,680
What do you mean by unstable?

197
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
<i>Angkab’s rebel group</i>

198
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,800
<i>is gathering forces.</i>

199
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,040
<i>Is Angkab not dead yet?</i>

200
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
<i>She is now the leader</i>
<i>of the rebel group causing chaos.</i>

201
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,680
<i>Queen Bua</i>

202
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,920
<i>has captured Kahla to use</i>
<i>as leverage against the rebels.</i>

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,720
<i>Kahla has been captured?</i>

204
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,960
Som Po.

205
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,080
Mother.

206
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,240
Som Po.

207
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,040
Let me look at your face
and ease my heart.

208
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,440
You're already pregnant, aren't you?

209
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,560
Yes.

210
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,240
Very good.

211
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,680
You must be tired from your journey.
Go get some rest.

212
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,680
Khemkao, my daughter.

213
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,200
Khemkao.

214
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,040
- Mother.
- Khemkao.

215
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,800
Are you alright?

216
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,600
My business here is done.

217
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,800
I shall take my leave.

218
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,360
You must have been through a lot.

219
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,080
Your pregnancy is going well.

220
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,560
It will be a daughter, right?

221
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,080
Judging by the signs,

222
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,240
it seems so.

223
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,160
Som Po,

224
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
- you’ve done it.
- Alright.

225
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,200
You will be the next Queen.

226
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,240
Drink the purifying antidote first.

227
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,480
So, I'll forget everything, right?

228
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
It's the rule.

229
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
You know it.

230
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,080
Lady Guardian Angkab was punished

231
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,160
because she broke the rules, right?

232
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,760
That’s right.

233
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,480
Then why did you send
Aunt Eungpueng to fetch me,

234
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,160
breaking the rules yourself?

235
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,480
There are things that must be done.

236
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,720
Once you become the Queen,

237
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
you’ll understand.

238
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,320
If the rules aren’t really rules,

239
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,520
then I don’t need to drink it.

240
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,840
How could you say that?

241
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,480
I will drink the purifying antidote

242
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,280
only if you release Kahla.

243
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,440
What did she do wrong?

244
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,640
Why did you order her imprisonment?

245
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,800
Her crime is that
she’s the daughter of a traitor!

246
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,040
But Kahla is not at fault.

247
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,840
Should a child
bear the sins of their mother?

248
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
If that’s the case,

249
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,640
what burdens must I carry as your child?

250
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,000
Watch your words.

251
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,440
I was able to return home safely

252
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,120
because Kahla saved me many times.

253
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,560
I owe her so much.

254
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,760
I want to cut this burden.

255
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,480
Release Kahla,

256
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,000
and then I will drink it

257
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,160
and do everything you say.

258
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,520
Alright.

259
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
I will release her.

260
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,560
Drink it.

261
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,040
Is that Mr. Henry’s map?

262
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,800
Don’t tell me that you're going to…

263
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,000
I’m going to find that Town in the Mist.

264
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,840
Som Po must be there.

265
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,880
Wait Mr. Chan.

266
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,760
Don't stop me.

267
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,080
I'm not stopping you.

268
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm going with you.

269
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,880
It’s dangerous.

270
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,080
You saw what happened to Henry,
didn’t you?

271
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,520
You’re free now,

272
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
not a servant anymore, so
you don’t have to keep serving a master.

273
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,680
But I don’t see you as my master.

274
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,280
If you’re going, then hurry up.

275
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,200
Mr. Chan.

276
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,520
Two heads are better than one.

277
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,000
But to be safest,

278
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,880
we should take a gun with us.

279
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,000
Mr. Chan, Som Po, and Am…

280
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,120
the gun is missing as well Sir.

281
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,920
Once everyone wakes up,

282
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,400
have them go ahead first.

283
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,680
Leave three or four soldiers with me,
and we’ll follow later.

284
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
Where are you going Sir?

285
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
I think…

286
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,720
it might be better for us to stay here,

287
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,400
in case Mr. Chan--

288
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
Forget about Chan!

289
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,520
I’m going after that witch
to teach her a lesson

290
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,800
for daring to challenge a Siamese soldier.

291
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
Yes Sir.

292
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,280
Mr. Chan.

293
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,760
Wait for me Mr. Chan. We'll get lost--

294
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
God help me!

295
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,600
- Ouch!
- Am!

296
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,560
Help me!

297
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,000
‪Help me!

298
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,920
‪Help me!

299
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,920
Chan, get up.

300
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,160
Go.

301
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,600
Go.

302
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,760
- Father, I have to go--
- Hurry up Sir.

303
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,800
- Go!
- Father!

304
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,200
Go.

305
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,160
‪Hurry up! Go!

306
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,440
It’s rare for you to return home Mother.

307
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,160
I’m so happy.

308
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,360
But Mother,

309
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,600
there are many dangers at the Misty Edge.

310
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
If one day you don’t come back…

311
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,000
Remember

312
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,120
that I have fulfilled my duty
as Lady Guardian to the fullest.

313
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,480
Be proud…

314
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,560
and continue doing your duty
to serve our land.

315
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Do you understand?

316
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,200
I won't surrender myself.

317
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,160
But Kahla will be executed!

318
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,960
Everyone here

319
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,440
has lost their child before.

320
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,480
How can I, for the sake
of my own child alone,

321
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,840
abandon everything that we have built

322
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,520
together?

323
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,560
Alright.

324
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,800
If you won’t help your own child,

325
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,360
then I will go save my wife myself.

326
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,040
Capture him!

327
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,320
Let go of me!

328
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,720
Back off!

329
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,840
Back off!

330
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,120
If you knew what this weapon can do,

331
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
you wouldn’t dare come near me.

332
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,920
My Queen, when will you release Kahla?

333
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,680
When Som Po wakes up,
the purifying antidote

334
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
will make her forget everything,

335
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,800
even the promise I made to her.

336
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,120
<i>What will happen</i>

337
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,040
after I take this purifying antidote?

338
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,600
Once you drink it,

339
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,480
you’ll become very sleepy and fall asleep.

340
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,720
When you wake up,

341
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
you won’t remember anything.

342
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,280
The more you take, the more you forget.

343
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,680
The less you take, the less you forget.

344
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,200
This plant is called "Vomiting Grass."

345
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,640
It’s very rare in Laplae,

346
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,520
but outside the town,

347
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,120
I’ve heard it’s much more abundant.

348
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,520
<i>This plant has a mild toxin.</i>

349
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,000
<i>If you eat it,</i>

350
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,360
<i>it will cause you to vomit</i>

351
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,600
<i>everything in your stomach.</i>

352
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,640
<i>That’s why it’s used as a remedy</i>

353
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,000
<i>for those who have</i>
<i>eaten something poisonous.</i>

354
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,760
My Queen.

355
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,240
As per our declaration
for the rebels to surrender

356
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,760
by tomorrow before sunset,

357
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,920
I believe Angkab won’t come.

358
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,400
What will you do with Kahla then?

359
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,560
Even if she doesn’t surrender,

360
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,440
she will try to rescue her child
in prison.

361
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,080
All you need to do is capture her.

362
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,840
Yes my Queen.

363
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,640
Lady Som Po,
why are you here alone this late?

364
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
I have business with the prisoner.

365
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,520
Let me in for just a moment.

366
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,960
Forgive me, but no one is allowed--

367
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,160
Do you dare defy my orders,

368
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,840
knowing I’m about to become Queen?

369
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,160
But Queen Bua ordered--

370
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,760
Queen Bua is about to step down.

371
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,160
If you have any sense, think about that.

372
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,040
Kahla.

373
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,760
I thought I would never see you again.

374
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,080
I apologize

375
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,200
for not returning with you.

376
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,400
Even though you knew that my mother
was sentenced to death by the Queen,

377
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,120
all you cared about was the Devil.

378
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,760
But your mother isn’t dead yet.
I heard it.

379
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,640
So, my mother was lucky to survive,

380
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,480
and now you and your mother
are suddenly righteous, is that it?

381
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
- That’s not true.
- Then what is it?

382
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
My mother isn’t righteous,

383
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,320
but she isn’t evil either.

384
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Not evil?

385
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,560
Tell me then,

386
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,239
what can you call what your mother did,

387
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,560
if not evil?

388
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,320
Mother is the Queen.

389
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,040
She had to fulfill her duty.

390
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,199
Ah, duty. You understand that word well.

391
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,920
Truly deserving of the title
of the new Queen, Lady Som Po.

392
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,960
So,

393
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,719
do we really have to be enemies?

394
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,960
What is that weapon?

395
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,400
It’s just like a crossbow,

396
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,200
but with this one gun,
I can kill ten people

397
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,120
and shoot as far as hundreds of meters.

398
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
Hey!

399
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,160
Are you trying to die?

400
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
It sounds just like
the thunder we heard the other day.

401
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,920
It wasn’t thunder.

402
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,720
It was this gun right here.

403
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,160
It can really break rocks.

404
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Now think for yourselves,

405
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,520
what will happen if I use this gun on you?

406
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,680
In that case,

407
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,320
use this to take Kahla back for me.

408
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,560
This is Laplae prison.

409
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,720
What are you going to do Devil Min?

410
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm going to rescue Kahla.

411
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,160
Let me make this clear first,
we people of Laplae do not kill.

412
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,760
I’m not killing anyone right now,

413
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,560
but if the situation--

414
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,280
If you kill someone,

415
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,840
the townspeople will hate
and go against the rebels even more.

416
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,120
Besides, we need to move
as quietly as possible.

417
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,160
If this gun is as loud as thunder,

418
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,120
the Lady Wardens will come for sure.

419
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,440
What’s your plan then? Just tell me.

420
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,520
Kahla.

421
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,480
Kahla.

422
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,040
Where is she? Kahla.

423
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,040
Where did she go?

424
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,080
I’m sure that she’s being held here.

425
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
The rebels went inside.

426
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm going to make some tea.
Would you like some?

427
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,720
Let me go.

428
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,560
My Queen, the rebels
have already snuck into the prison.

429
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,960
They’ve broken in to rescue Kahla
before the deadline

430
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,120
just as expected.

431
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,920
Bua.

432
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,680
Couldn't your mother

433
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,800
come up with a more clever plan than this?

434
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,880
If it weren’t for my mercy as the Queen,

435
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,400
your mother wouldn’t hold
any position in this town

436
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,720
because she is lacking in wisdom.

437
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,560
Kahla is not here.

438
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,680
We’ve been deceived.

439
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,800
This is a trap!

440
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,080
Som Po.

441
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Som Po.

442
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,880
Step back
if you don’t want Bua’s child to die.

443
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,920
Step back!

444
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,120
Som Po.

445
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
Som Po.

446
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,040
Som Po.

447
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,120
How could Som Po be there?

448
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,960
- I think she--
- What?

449
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,320
Nothing my Queen.

450
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
I take full responsibility for everything.

451
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,040
- Father, let go of me.
- I won't.

452
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,480
- Go back with me.
- I'm not going.

453
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,800
- Father, I need to go.
- No.

454
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,440
- I said let go of me!
- Whoa!

455
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,560
Do you want to die?

456
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,760
Luang Mitr Sir,
Am is not looking good now.

457
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,040
I don’t know if he’ll make it.

458
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,240
Am.

459
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,440
Am. Look what you've done!

460
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,000
You’re a leader,

461
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,960
don’t go dragging your men
to their deaths like this.

462
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Bear that in mind!

463
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,240
There's a house up ahead Sir.

464
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,560
We’ll stop here.

465
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,760
We need to ask for water
and treat Am’s wounds first.

466
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,960
Wait here, I’ll go check if anyone’s home.

467
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,960
Am, hang in there.

468
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,080
Am. Am.

469
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,120
Excuse me.

470
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,280
Excuse me, I’ve traveled
a long way and someone is injured.

471
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,240
Could I ask for some water, please?

472
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,680

<i>My Goodness. The Queen's daughter.</i>

474
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,480
Aunt, what did you and Mother argue about?

475
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,880
Why did it escalate like this?

476
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,440
A hostage exchange, is that it?

477
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,800
<i>Yes, Kahla and Som Po.</i>

478
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,080
I owe you nothing anymore.

479
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,120
If you die in that mist before you get
to see your wife’s face again,

480
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,080
<i>how would that be?</i>

481
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,240
I’m not a coward like you Father.
