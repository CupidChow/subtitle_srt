00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,920
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,920
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED
FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
People of Laplae…

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,840
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,280
You are all heartless evils.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,520
My mother, she’s from Laplae, isn’t she?

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
Yes, but you’re not going to meet her.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,960
<i>What are you doing Chan?</i>

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,560
<i>I’m not a coward like you Father.</i>

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,360
Why didn’t you listen to me
and take the purifying antidote?

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,520
And did you take it Mother?

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,960
Hey!

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,280
The Queen must explain.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,880
- We want the truth!
- The truth!

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,320
I will let Goddess Som be the judge.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,400
So everyone in the town

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,040
<i>will be able to clear up their doubts.</i>

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,360
Nothing happened to the Queen.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,440
The Queen is innocent.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
Last night, did you hear
the sound of the flute?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,360
Som Po, what are you doing?

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,080
I didn't do anything.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
If you lie, Goddess Som will punish you.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
Why did you steal my flute to play?

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,759
I wanted to practice the song you played

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,400
near the Misty Edge the other night.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Come here.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
I’ll teach you.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
But you must swear

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
that you'll never play this song

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
where anyone in Laplae can hear it.

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,280
And when you practice,

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,600
no one must see or hear you.

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
Most importantly,

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,240
you must never tell anyone

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
that you saw me playing the flute.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,920
Understand?

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,400
I understand.

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,360
Swear to Goddess Som.

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
Som Po.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
Yes.

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,160
I’m going out to handle
the town’s affairs.

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,440
You come along too.

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,480
Once you become Queen,
you’ll need to know how things work.

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,600
I told Lady Healer
I’d go for a prenatal check-up.

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,360
Take one of the wardens along with you.

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
Don’t go anywhere alone.

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,640
If the rebels capture you again,
it will cause trouble for everyone.

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes.

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
Mother.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,960
I wonder…

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,320
why the Mist Demon didn’t appear.

54
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,440
Because Goddess Som knows
I did nothing wrong,

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,640
so she didn’t send the Mist Demon.

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
Right.

57
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,160
Som Po.

58
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
It’s good that you’re here.

59
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,200
I once fought the Mist Demon
and nearly lost,

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,760
but the Queen saved me.

61
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,480
That time, I heard the sound of a flute.

62
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,200
I don’t know if this flute

63
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,000
can truly command the Mist Demon.

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,320
If it doesn’t work, what will we do?

65
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,280
I will protect you.

66
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,880
Som Po.

67
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,680
Som Po, stay behind me.

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,800
Som Po!

69
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,360
Som Po, the flute!

70
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Som Po, the flute!

71
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Som Po, the flute!

72
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Som Po.

73
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
The flute’s melody…

74
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,480
can control the Mist Demon.

75
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,240
My mother can control the Mist Demon.

76
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
Alright.

77
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,480
This is the outside world.
It’s much like here,

78
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,320
except people raise animals

79
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,679
and live together as families.
Father, mother, and children.

80
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
What is a father?

81
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
A father

82
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,480
is a devil like me, but he's called a man.

83
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,559
- A man?
- Yes.

84
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,240
And don’t devils eat little children?

85
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,880
Oh, Songpeep,

86
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,400
ever since I was born,
I’ve never seen anyone eat another person.

87
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
And when they have children,

88
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,760
they protect and care for them.

89
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,800
In truth, women and devils

90
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,320
can have good relationships
with each other.

91
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,920
It’s not like what we were taught
in the Training House.

92
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,560
When the time for change comes,

93
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,840
I believe that good devils
could help Laplae thrive.

94
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
Mother, you're a liar.

95
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,920
About the Mist Demon,
the flute, and even Goddess Som.

96
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
Watch your words Som Po.

97
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,240
I’m not just your mother.

98
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,640
I’m also the Queen.

99
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,320
No matter how you punish me,

100
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
it won’t hide the truth that

101
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
you're the one
who controls the Mist Demon.

102
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,040
Every time a woman
in Laplae breaks the rules,

103
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,320
they say Goddess Som
sends the Mist Demon to punish them.

104
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,720
But in reality,

105
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
it’s you.

106
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,880
So what?

107
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,560
Whether it’s Goddess Som or me,

108
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,160
what’s the difference?

109
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
Mother,

110
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,000
how could you do something so despicable?

111
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,520
If it’s to protect Laplae,

112
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,560
I’d do something

113
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
even worse.

114
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,760
Som Po,

115
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,480
it’s time you learned the truth.

116
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,640
In the past,
Laplae was like any other town,

117
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,560
with both women

118
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
and devils living together.

119
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,640
However, the devils

120
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,520
were all consumed by lust

121
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,560
and immorality,

122
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,920
taking whatever they desired by force,

123
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,920
robbing, killing, and raping.

124
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,760
At that time, the foremother women
of our lineage

125
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,000
united

126
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,720
to lead the women

127
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,120
into battle, driving the devils out.

128
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,680
Goddess Som was the source of their unity,

129
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,440
and that’s how Laplae
became what it is today.

130
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,760
Our ancestors

131
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,640
created Goddess Som?

132
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,640
Goddess Som, Laplae,

133
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,040
and our family

134
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,840
are one.

135
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,400
We are the lifeblood of this town.

136
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,120
We are Laplae.

137
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,400
Including the Mist Demon?

138
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Little one,

139
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,280
if you have rules

140
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,680
but no punishment,

141
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,760
who will obey?

142
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,560
The Mist Demon isn’t meant to punish

143
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,680
but to control the entire town.

144
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,440
It’s all to protect the town from
the desires that corrupt human hearts.

145
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,080
Our family sacrifices.

146
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,680
We have to do things we don’t want to do.

147
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Even ordering people to be killed?

148
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,880
Making certain people disappear

149
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,440
to protect the entire town,

150
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,240
do you really call that evil?

151
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,680
When you give birth,

152
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
you will carry
this responsibility forward,

153
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
for all the women of Laplae.

154
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,520
I can’t do it.

155
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,120
I can’t do it. I can't.

156
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,520
You can.

157
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,840
I’ll help you.

158
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Kahla.

159
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,880
You have morning sickness?

160
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,040
Put the water down.
Let me handle it for you.

161
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,960
I’m fine, I can do it.

162
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
There you go, still trying to act tough.

163
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Here, put the water down for now.

164
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,880
I’ll carry you back to the cave,
and then come back for it later.

165
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,480
Just a short rest, and I’ll feel better.

166
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,880
What are you doing? Let go of me.

167
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,480
I’m not letting anything
happen to my wife and child.

168
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,440
You’re pregnant,

169
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,680
so don’t stress too much, alright?

170
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,280
It’s not good for the baby.

171
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
How can I not worry

172
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,280
when Queen Bua walked out of Moon Square
without a scratch?

173
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,840
The women in town
will only praise her even more.

174
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,360
Queen Bua probably used some trick
to keep the Mist Demon from harming her.

175
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,800
And how can we

176
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,920
get the townspeople to know the truth?

177
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,760
The truth?

178
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,520
Sometimes, it’s not as important

179
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,360
as the long-standing beliefs
or faith that has been ingrained in them.

180
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,400
But what about you?

181
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,080
Do you believe in this Goddess Som stuff?

182
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,640
I’m not sure.

183
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Goddess Som isn’t just
in your town, you know.

184
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,280
Where I’m from, we call it the moon.

185
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,280
It’s the same moon after all.

186
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
So to say it only protects your town
doesn’t seem right.

187
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,680
And how can I erase

188
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,200
the faith that the people of Laplae have?

189
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,200
I’ve heard the people of your town
sing a song praising Goddess Som.

190
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,560
That’s the thing.

191
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,440
That's how faith is built.

192
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,880
I’m feeling better now.

193
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,000
Wait, where are you going?

194
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,640
To get the water of course.

195
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,880
What?

196
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
In your eyes,

197
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,040
I’m probably not even your son.

198
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,360
All I want is to meet my mother
and my wife just once,

199
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,360
yet here I am, tied up.

200
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,520
Actually I was going to untie you
to make you more comfortable,

201
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,440
but since you’re still obsessed
with finding that woman,

202
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,720
being tied up like this
suits you just fine.

203
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,840
If only you had loved my mother,

204
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,840
you would’ve gone to search for her,
just like I’m going after Som Po.

205
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,440
Women from the Town of Mist

206
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,880
see men as nothing more than

207
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
breeding stock.

208
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
Both you and I are fools,

209
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,200
deceived by women from the Town of Mist.

210
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,400
I never knew anything about my mother.

211
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,960
Until recently,

212
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,360
I just found out that my mother

213
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,240
is from Laplae, just like Som Po.

214
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,520
Yet,

215
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,640
you’re still stopping me
from finding both my mother and my wife.

216
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,280
Khun Luang Sir, we’ve received reports
that the Ngiao are gathering in this area.

217
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,560
Keep an eye on Chan.

218
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,760
- Yes Sir.
- Let's go.

219
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,720
Alright.

220
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,680
The guns we stole this time,

221
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,080
I’ll send them to our people tonight.

222
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,680
Do we need to wait for Min?

223
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,400
No need. He said he’s going to
get gold to trade for more guns.

224
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
But if we get more gold from Min,
we could buy even more guns,

225
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,240
enough to send the Siamese soldiers
running back to Bangkok in no time.

226
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,400
Hey!

227
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,160
A Siamese soldier like me,

228
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,440
running back to Phra Nakhon?

229
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
Besides here,
where else are the Ngiao hiding?

230
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,600
I respect

231
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,680
your loyalty to your comrades.

232
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,440
So I’ll ask about

233
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
something unrelated to them.

234
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Where did you get the gold you’re using

235
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,360
to trade for the guns?

236
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,280
Hey!

237
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,480
Let me go!

238
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,080
I’ll give you one more chance.

239
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
If you don’t say anything…

240
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,920
you’ll never hear from your friend again.

241
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,120
The Town of Mist…

242
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,680
Min said he’s going to
get the gold from the Town of Mist.

243
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,200
The Town of Mist?

244
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,160
So,

245
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,800
have you remembered anything yet?

246
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,640
Listen,

247
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,880
I need to get into that Town of Mist,

248
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
as it's a matter of the country.

249
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,120
Lady Soi,
you are definitely from that town.

250
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,880
Do you happen to know
how to get into the Mist?

251
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,560
That's right.

252
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,480
I remember the Mist.

253
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,840
Grandma

254
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,680
gave me this bundle

255
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,960
before she died.

256
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,880
Gold?

257
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,680
This golden turmeric

258
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,480
will help you enter the Town of Mist,

259
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,280
but you must take me with you.

260
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,120
Tonight,

261
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,840
go rest in the tent.

262
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,880
We need to leave early in the morning

263
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,920
to enter Laplae.

264
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,880
The rebel forces aren’t as strong
as the Lady Guardians and Wardens,

265
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,160
but there’s a devil among them.

266
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
A devil?

267
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,880
That devil came with Kahla.

268
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,760
Good.

269
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,320
One day, that devil

270
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,360
will bring trouble to the rebels.

271
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
Even though the rebels
are still few in number,

272
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,360
they’re steadily recruiting more women.

273
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,080
I know where the rebel caves are.

274
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,560
Just give the order Queen Bua,

275
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,400
and I’ll be ready to bring you there.

276
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,480
If women die

277
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,920
because of the Queen’s command,

278
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,160
do you think

279
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,440
the women of Laplae
will still allow me to rule?

280
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,120
Is this all the rice
you managed to get Chaba?

281
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,000
They heavily guarded the barn.

282
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,360
This is all I could bring.

283
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,560
There are so many people in the cave.
How is this bit going to be enough?

284
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,680
Chaba and I risked a lot

285
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,360
to sneak this food.
We had to hide and avoid the Lady Wardens.

286
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,360
Getting this much is already
a big achievement, isn’t it?

287
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,800
Alright, alright, no need to argue.

288
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,280
You two

289
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,520
need to figure out how to bring
more food and water next time.

290
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,880
For now, everyone
has to endure these hardships.

291
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,600
What is this?

292
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,880
- Why did they call us here?
- I'm wondering too.

293
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,360
The women of Laplae must already know that

294
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,200
there is nothing

295
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,200
more important to me

296
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,960
than every single woman of this town,

297
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,760
whom I see as my own daughters.

298
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
Even though some may be

299
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,400
rebellious, defiant,

300
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,440
and refuse to listen to me,

301
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,960
I still see them

302
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,520
as misguided children.

303
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,920
That is why I want to give each of them

304
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,600
the chance to return to me,

305
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,320
to return to Goddess Som.

306
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,520
‪I bow to you, Goddess Som.

307
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
At dawn tomorrow,

308
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,520
if any rebel comes forward,

309
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,760
I will not hold her accountable,

310
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,480
and I will raise her status.

311
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,560
She will no longer be a laborer.

312
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,920
Oh, we bow to you Queen Bua.

313
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,120
What plan does your mother have this time?

314
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,440
I don’t know,

315
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,560
but it’s surely not good.

316
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,400
No punishment at all?

317
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Yes, and they won’t
have to be laborers anymore either.

318
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,680
You believe anything Queen Bua says?

319
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,320
It’s all lies.

320
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,840
Anyone who believes her is a fool.

321
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,320
I don’t believe her,
I’m just telling you what I heard.

322
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,200
If surrendering means no punishment

323
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,600
and not being a laborer anymore,
isn’t that a good thing?

324
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,760
So you just don’t want to work hard?

325
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,080
- How weak.
- Hey, Goya, we all work hard.

326
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,640
What’s so wrong
about not wanting to be a laborer?

327
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,560
If you just take the easy way out,
nothing will ever change.

328
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,280
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Enough!

329
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,720
Stop arguing.

330
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,880
What do you say?

331
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,520
We came together,
and if we go, we go together.

332
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,160
I’m really torn.

333
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,680
What if this is just one of Bua’s traps?

334
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,840
What is there to be
afraid of anymore Songpeep?

335
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,680
Staying with the rebels means
we have to fight until something changes,

336
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,600
and we might even die before that happens.

337
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,680
If we go back and Bua betrays us,

338
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,880
the worst that can happen is death.

339
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,480
But if she’s telling the truth,

340
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,680
we won’t have to clean and toil anymore.

341
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,640
Songpeep?

342
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,600
Alright, let’s do what you say.

343
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,880
What is Queen Bua really planning?

344
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,040
I’m not sure, but one thing is clear,

345
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,240
she’s trying to divide us.

346
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,840
You can see it for yourself.

347
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,200
Just by offering forgiveness

348
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,680
and an exemption from being a laborer,
people already want to return to her.

349
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,680
I don’t believe anyone will surrender.

350
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,000
Don’t be so sure.

351
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,440
Sorry Kahla, but I overheard Chaba
and Songpeep talking about running away.

352
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,720
Running away to surrender?

353
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,360
Keep your voice down,
or the rebels will hear.

354
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,360
We are the rebels.

355
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,480
No, we're not rebels anymore.

356
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,520
We are those who want to turn back.

357
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,680
Turn back to where Chaba?

358
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,120
Kahla,

359
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,040
please understand us.

360
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,880
Let us go and surrender.

361
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,120
I promise
I won’t tell anyone about this cave.

362
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,160
Kahla,

363
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,640
a coward like Chaba
will surely tell Queen Bua.

364
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,720
Chaba, and all of you, think carefully.

365
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,160
If you surrender now,

366
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,440
everything Lady Angkab did for you

367
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,040
will be for nothing.

368
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,360
Remember the devil children we lost
because of those cursed laws.

369
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,360
Didn’t we come together
because we wanted change?

370
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,400
Change doesn’t come easily.

371
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
At night, we train for battle,

372
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,440
and by day, we return to being slaves.

373
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,520
I’m exhausted.

374
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,240
We can’t beat Queen Bua,
she has too much power.

375
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,280
And do you really think

376
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,800
they aren't lying to you?

377
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
Whoever still wants change, stay.

378
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,480
I’ve lost hope in this fight.

379
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,520
I’ll return to living
as an ordinary person,

380
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,440
with no involvement in this,

381
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,400
neither with the Queen nor the rebels.

382
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,040
Chaba.

383
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,520
If you’re going to shoot me, go ahead.

384
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,080
We can’t let them leave.

385
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,720
Even if they don’t tell,

386
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,880
Queen Bua will find a way
to make them talk.

387
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,400
Goya, wait--

388
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,760
Wait.

389
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,960
- Chaba, I can't let you go.
- Let me go Goya.

390
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,400
Let me go!

391
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,400
If I let you go, everyone here will die.

392
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,560
And do you think
staying here will save you?

393
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,440
Surrendering gives us
a better chance of survival.

394
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,320
- I won’t let you leave.
- Chaba.

395
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,440
Goya!

396
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,880
Chaba!

397
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,160
- Wait.
- Stop!

398
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,280
- Oh.
- Why is it like this?

399
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,760
- Goya!
- Stop! Stop now.

400
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,160
- Let me go.
- I won't.

401
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,040
Chaba!

402
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,560
Let me go! Chaba!

403
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,240
Chaba, what's going on?

404
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,720
Chaba, wake up.

405
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,400
Wake up!

406
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,480
You said you’d go with me.

407
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,520
Chaba, wake up.

408
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
You said we’d stay together.

409
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,360
Chaba!

410
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
Chaba…

411
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,760
Chaba, wake up.

412
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,679
Please answer me.

413
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,920
Chaba.

414
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,960
- Wake up.
- What happened to Chaba?

415
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,040
Goya… Goya killed Chaba.

416
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,120
Chaba, Songpeep, and the others
were going to surrender.

417
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,199
I tried to stop them,
and Chaba fell and hit her head.

418
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,880
Lady Angkab, please punish me.

419
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,360
We’ll deal with the punishment later.

420
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,560
We need to take care of Chaba.

421
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,239
Wake up.

422
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,720
Wake up. I can't live without you.

423
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Anyone who still wishes to surrender,

424
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,080
go now.

425
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,680
I bid you farewell, Lady Angkab.

426
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,800
‪I'm leaving now.

427
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,760
Are you sure it’s good
to let them go like this?

428
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,880
Keeping them here
will only cause division.

429
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,520
Right now, we need to return to the cave,

430
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,600
move our supplies,
before Bua finds out where we are.

431
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,560
What did the rebels say?

432
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,000
They’re divided
and have started killing each other.

433
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,840
By tomorrow, many of them
are sure to come and surrender.

434
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,280
Good. Let them come in great numbers.

435
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,040
Angkab and the rebels
who seek to overthrow Goddess Som

436
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,600
will have no place left to call home.

437
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,480
Songpeep, why are you here?

438
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,160
I apologize. I didn’t think it through.

439
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,920
Chaba was my dearest friend,

440
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,360
and she died because
she didn’t want to be of a lower class.

441
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,240
If I surrender now,

442
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,520
her death will mean nothing.

443
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,000
There are still many women in Laplae

444
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,120
who are forced into the lower class
because of these senseless laws.

445
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,840
Lady Angkab,

446
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,680
please let me return
and fight in Chaba’s place.

447
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,400
Since the rebels refuse to accept mercy,

448
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,720
let it be known to all of Laplae

449
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,960
that the rebels are not only opposing me

450
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,080
but defying Goddess Som herself.

451
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,360
<i>And how can I erase</i>

452
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,840
the faith that the people of Laplae have?

453
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,040
I’ve heard the people of your town
sing a song praising Goddess Som.

454
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
That's the thing.

455
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,000
That's how faith is built.

456
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,680
<i>Radiant as the heavens</i>

457
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,960
<i>Beauty unmatched by any land or mountain</i>

458
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,960
<i>No gods protect our homes</i>

459
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,560
<i>Only we, the people of Laplae</i>

460
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,000
<i>No gods protect our homes</i>

461
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,920
<i>Only we, the people of Laplae</i>

462
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,520
<i>Every life born</i>

463
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,560
<i>Holds value</i>

464
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,400
<i>Everywhere and in every place</i>

465
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:05,840
<i>No one stands above</i>

466
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,440
<i>Only we ourselves guide our destiny</i>

467
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,920
<i>Cast aside the inherited words</i>

468
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,320
<i>And believe in the value of ourselves</i>

469
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,800
<i>We are the power of the people</i>

470
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,800
<i>And the people must rise above all</i>

471
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,160
<i>The people must rise above all</i>

472
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,720
<i>The people must rise above all</i>

473
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,200
<i>The people must rise above all</i>

474
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,080
<i>The people must rise above all</i>

475
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,480
I can't do it my Queen.

476
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,080
Remember

477
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,880
whose grace and favor have allowed you

478
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,080
to be where you are today.

479
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,400
I heard there was an outbreak,
so I rushed here.

480
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,800
What’s wrong with all of you?

481
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,360
We’ve caught the plague from the town.

482
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,000
If you follow Goddess Som's guidance,
you don't need to worry.

483
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,640
She will not abandon us.

484
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,600
