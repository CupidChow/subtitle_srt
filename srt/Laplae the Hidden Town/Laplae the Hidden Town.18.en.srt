The town leader…

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,160
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,400
…is my mother?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,480
Who is my real mother?

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,120
Anchan’s memories
will be the key to everything.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,240
My Queen,

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,600
we have a serious situation.
Anchan, Angkab’s sister, is still alive.

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,840
She's with the rebels.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,400
Bring Anchan,

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,080
dead or alive.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,000
This page talks about
the purifying antidote,

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,120
so this must be
the memory-restoring potion.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,560
Som Po, are you sure you can heal Anchan?

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,880
Aunt Anchan.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,840
Angkab.

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Angkab!

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
The flute sound…

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,720
The Mist Demon.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,400
Queen Bua has called the Mist Demon here.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
It's too late. Prepare the weapons.

25
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,280
You should hide here.

26
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,880
I'll go back to help Kahla.

27
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,360
Be careful.

28
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,920
You too.

29
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,840
If you’re not sure it’s me,
don’t come out.

30
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,560
Wait.

31
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm going with you.

32
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
Use this to protect yourself.

33
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,240
I'll be right back.

34
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Let's go.

35
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
Take care of yourself.

36
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,960
Hurry up. Let's go.

37
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,600
Capture them! Capture them all!

38
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
I haven't seen Anchan.

39
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,040
<i>Anchan.</i>

40
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
I'll go and see.

41
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,560
Anchan, where are you?

42
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,560
Come on out. I've missed you so much.

43
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,040
It's Queen Bua.

44
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Som Po.

45
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,000
You stay here.

46
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,040
You're about to become a mother.

47
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
A mother must protect her child.

48
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
You have to protect your child.

49
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
Alright?

50
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Anchan.

51
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,760
Where are you?

52
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,640
I've missed you so much.

53
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,320
I'm right here.

54
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,640
I haven't seen you for ages.

55
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,800
I thought you were dead.

56
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,800
If you’re dead, just stay dead.
There’s no need to come back.

57
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
Bury her body.

58
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Don't let anyone know or see.

59
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Yes my Queen.

60
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,520
Kahla.

61
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
Oh.

62
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,560
Kahla.

63
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,360
Where is Kahla?

64
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,200
Goya.

65
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
Goya.

66
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,280
You're alive!

67
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,040
They took Kahla and Lady Angkab.

68
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,760
Can you stand up?

69
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,960
- Um.
- Ugh!

70
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,560
Som Po.

71
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240
How are you? Are you alright?

72
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,640
Som Po.

73
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,960
Where is Aunt Anchan?

74
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,480
It's alright.

75
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,160
It's alright.

76
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,600
I’ve gotten some news.

77
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,000
The Queen plans to have Lady Guardian
and Kahla punished by Goddess Som

78
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,000
today at the town square.

79
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,920
What does that mean?

80
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,800
Queen Bua is going to execute
Aunt Angkab and Kahla.

81
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,560
Does it have to go that far?

82
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
I have a way to help.

83
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,680
They're rebels.

84
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
They deserve it.

85
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,800
I’ve stationed forces
around the town square,

86
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,200
and crossbowmen
are hidden at various points.

87
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,800
If Angkab and Kahla manage to escape,

88
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,200
shoot them down.

89
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,880
Understood.

90
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,400
I truly regret

91
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,000
that your bloodline must end today.

92
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,280
Your children,

93
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,840
your sister, and your grandchild.

94
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,280
What do you mean?

95
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,760
What have you done to Anchan?

96
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,000
What could I have done?

97
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,040
Anchan died long ago.

98
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,280
She simply had to keep being dead.

99
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,280
Bua! You heartless witch!

100
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,240
You heartless witch!

101
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Stop! Shut up!

102
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,880
Women of Laplae,

103
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,000
what you see before you

104
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,840
are Angkab and Kahla,
leaders of the rebels.

105
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,000
They are responsible for Laplae’s chaos,

106
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
enraging Goddess Som,

107
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,440
and causing the plague
and other calamities.

108
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,840
- It’s all your fault!
- It's you.

109
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,120
- You witch!
- It's your fault!

110
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,680
The time has come for us,

111
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,920
- You’ll die!
- It's your fault!

112
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,800
the women of Laplae,

113
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,760
to deliver justice

114
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,720
upon these rebel leaders
for bringing so much turmoil to Laplae.

115
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,240
And tonight,

116
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,319
Goddess Som will carry out
her judgment upon them.

117
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
You deserve it!

118
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,359
- You deserve it!
- You'll die!

119
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,599
- You deserve to die!
- It's your fault!

120
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,280
- You should die!
- Die now!

121
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,079
- You traitor!
- You witch!

122
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,960
- You deserve to die!
- It serves you right!

123
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,160
- You should die!
- You traitor!

124
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,119
- Die now!
- Traitor!

125
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
Stop!

126
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,680
What is that?

127
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,720
Som Po.

128
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,120
What are you doing?

129
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,840
Women of Laplae, listen to me.

130
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,560
I bring the truth to light
for everyone to hear.

131
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,400
What is it?

132
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,280
Queen Bua has been deceiving us all!

133
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,320
Huh?

134
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,280
Som Po.

135
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,680
You may be my daughter,

136
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,720
but if you spread lies and falsehoods,

137
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,840
I will punish you like anyone else.

138
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,120
You are a liar.

139
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,440
You are not my real mother.

140
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,880
- Huh?!
- What?!

141
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,240
What?

142
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,400
Ungrateful child.

143
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,280
I raised you since you were born.

144
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,560
How could I not be your mother?

145
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,640
But the one
who gave birth to me was Anchan,

146
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,960
and Queen Bua killed her!

147
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,400
- Huh!
- Really?

148
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,800
What is this?

149
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,680
What are you talking about?

150
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,000
Anchan died during childbirth
nearly twenty years ago.

151
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,760
- Huh?!
- Hey?!

152
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,360
If Anchan had died
almost twenty years ago,

153
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,480
her body would be nothing
but bones by now.

154
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,760
But here…

155
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,040
This is her body. She died last night…

156
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
by Queen Bua's hands.

157
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Before she died,

158
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,600
Mother Anchan told me everything.

159
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,200
Queen Bua, you're so sinful.

160
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,920
I’m the younger twin of Angkab

161
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,080
and once Bua's dearest friend.

162
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,120
Mother Bua's dearest friend?

163
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,400
<i>I went out devil-hunting</i>
<i>alongside Angkab and Bua.</i>

164
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,680
<i>We all became pregnant</i>
<i>around the same time</i>

165
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,160
<i>and returned to Laplae together.</i>

166
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,480
<i>Angkab was the first to give birth.</i>

167
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,040
Are you ready?

168
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,560
Push!

169
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,400
Push harder!

170
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,680
Boonnak, help her push!

171
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,560
Take a deep breath.

172
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,680
One, two, three.

173
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,920
It’s out!

174
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,120
Angkab, you have a baby girl.

175
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,760
<i>Not long after Kahla was born,</i>

176
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,160
<i>both Bua and I</i>
<i>went into labor the same day.</i>

177
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
Lady Bua, are you ready?

178
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
Push!

179
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,960
<i>I went into labor at the same time</i>
<i>as the Queen’s daughter,</i>

180
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,280
<i>so the Great Healer had to tend to her.</i>

181
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,040
<i>Lady Healer Boonnak</i>
<i>helped me deliver my child.</i>

182
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,960
One, two, three!

183
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,920
It's out!

184
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,440
You’ve had a baby girl.

185
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,400
I…

186
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,360
<i>However, I gave birth before Bua did.</i>

187
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,800
Bua has given birth.

188
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,840
When you grow up,
you'll be friends with each other.

189
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
But strangely,

190
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,840
- My Queen, what's the matter?
<i>- Queen Bongkod…</i>

191
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,400
<i>took another baby into my room</i>

192
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,880
<i>and swapped Bua’s devil child</i>

193
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
<i>with my daughter.</i>

194
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,480
My Queen!

195
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Boonnak.

196
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,840
What are you doing? Give me back my child!

197
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,400
Your child is a devil.
It cannot stay in Laplae.

198
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,520
No, my child is…

199
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,560
My child!

200
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,560
Stay still!

201
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,680
Did you give birth to a girl?

202
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,160
Som Po…

203
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,400
Queen Bua raised me.

204
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,320
My child…

205
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,280
The truth is,

206
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,840
I am Mother Anchan's daughter

207
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,440
who was swapped
with the Queen’s child by Queen Bongkod.

208
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,000
Your child was a devil.

209
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
- Hey?!
- Huh?!

210
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,680
You can't be the Queen.

211
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,760
Ungrateful! I raised you since birth,

212
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,480
and now you turn against me,
siding with the rebels?

213
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,280
Women of Laplae,

214
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,480
you’ve seen the truth for yourselves.

215
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,720
Lady Bongkod told us
that Anchan died in childbirth,

216
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,680
but she and Bua

217
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,400
have deceived us all.

218
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,240
Don’t listen to them!

219
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,880
Som Po and Angkab are lying!

220
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,240
Goddess Som will punish them.

221
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,600
You must trust me.

222
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,200
Trust only me!

223
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,680
Capture Som Po and the rebels
and punish them.

224
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,720
Don't let them tell more lies!

225
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,240
Did you hear that?

226
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,800
<i>Radiant as the heavens</i>

227
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,600
<i>Beauty unmatched by any land or mountain</i>

228
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,880
<i>No gods protect our homes</i>

229
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,960
<i>Only we, the people of Laplae</i>

230
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,280
<i>Every life born</i>

231
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,520
<i>Holds value everywhere and in every place</i>

232
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,840
<i>No one stands above</i>

233
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,800
<i>Only we ourselves guide our destiny</i>

234
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,840
<i>Cast aside the inherited words</i>

235
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,520
<i>And believe in the value of ourselves</i>

236
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,000
<i>We are the power of the people</i>

237
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,760
<i>And the people must rise above all</i>

238
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,880
<i>People must guide their own destiny.</i>

239
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,840
<i>Only we ourselves guide our destiny</i>

240
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,920
Can I really trust him?

241
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,360
Here you go.

242
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,840
It's your bag isn't it?
I stole it back for you.

243
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,800
What?

244
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,160
Aunt Eungpueng said,

245
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,160
the items taken from us
were kept in the armory.

246
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,880
How did you get them?

247
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,920
Wait, my Queen.

248
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,600
If we take shelter in the house,
we’ll be cornered.

249
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,560
Let’s run a little farther.

250
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,200
Trust me, our way out
lies within this house.

251
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,480
Stop.

252
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
Bua!

253
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,840
Instead of fleeing,
they’ve taken shelter inside that house.

254
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,280
There might be a trap.

255
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,800
Som Po, you don't have to go in.

256
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,720
I’ll go in with you.

257
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,440
You and the remaining wardens
stay outside,

258
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
in case they try to escape.

259
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,440
Yes, Lady Guardian Angkab.

260
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,440
Let's go.

261
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,560
Go.

262
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Your face looks like someone near death.

263
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,920
The one near death is you.

264
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,640
This time, we have real bullets,
not stones.

265
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,040
You’ve lost your power.

266
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,000
The rebels are too arrogant.

267
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,640
Goddess Som will punish all of you.

268
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,560
Let’s see what’s faster,

269
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,880
your bullets or you.

270
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Everyone, get ready!

271
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,760
Wait.

272
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,920
Aunt Angkab.

273
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,440
We don’t need to shoot.

274
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,920
If Queen Bua wants to play her flute,

275
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,360
let her.

276
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,080
Som Po, you…

277
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,960
You…

278
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,320
The Mist Demon

279
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,320
reminds me of a man I met
outside the town.

280
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,280
‪-Catch him!
‪-Hold him down!

281
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,840
A man turned into that by drugs.

282
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,040
The Healer once said that
the smoke from Mist flower root

283
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,200
creates a state of euphoria,

284
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,720
making one crave it again and again.

285
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,520
So it’s possible these herbs
could drive someone to madness,

286
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,240
making them obedient,

287
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,680
like a servant.

288
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,760
I think the Queen controls Mist Demons

289
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,760
with this herbal mixture.

290
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Mist flower root,

291
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,160
Soi Som leaf,

292
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,400
and Bulan mushroom…

293
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,400
These are…

294
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,760
the offerings to Goddess Som.

295
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,120
Chan, Chan.

296
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,240
Chan, are you done?

297
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,480
Chan!

298
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,480
Almost done.

299
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,200
They're coming.

300
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,560
Just a bit more.

301
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,720
Now Chan, throw it.

302
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,560
Wait.

303
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,960
We only have one chance.

304
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,040
Then throw it.

305
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,840
Chan, wait.

306
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,040
No matter what, the demons won’t come out.

307
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,600
Are you challenging me?

308
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,960
Bua, put the flute down.

309
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,320
We're screwed.

310
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,080
Stop!

311
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,040
Shall we shoot?

312
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,040
Pull the trigger when I count to three.

313
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
One!

314
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,159
Two!

315
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,400
My Queen.

316
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,560
What was that sound?

317
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,160
- My Queen.
- What was that sound?

318
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,480
From now on,
no matter how much you play the flute,

319
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,960
the demons will never come out again.

320
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,680
The sound you heard earlier
was from a weapon called a bomb.

321
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,880
By now, the Mist Demons are likely dead,

322
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,720
by the hands of your own son.

323
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,440
Yeehub!

324
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,400
Everything is over Queen Bua.

325
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,760
What’s with all these baskets?

326
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,800
They’re everywhere.

327
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,480
I think we’re close to their lair.

328
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,680
Stay alert.

329
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,680
So, a boy born here

330
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,920
is turned into a Mist Demon?

331
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,440
You've been dethroned.

332
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,120
You have nothing left to do.

333
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,080
Now, with all the time you have,

334
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,840
use it to reflect on
the sins you’ve committed.

335
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,680
Angkab,

336
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,200
Eungpueng, you traitors!

337
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,040
I made you Lady Guardian,
and this is how you repay me?

338
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,280
You’ve turned against me
like ungrateful snakes!

339
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,240
I’ve already taken Pudson
to be locked away separately.

340
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,160
Alright.

341
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,960
Good job Eungpueng.

342
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,760
You may go now, Lady Guardian.

343
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,080
Yes, my Queen.

344
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,760
You must be pleased now, huh?

345
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,640
You must have always
been plotting to take my position.

346
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,440
Ruling this town
isn’t as easy as you think.

347
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,760
I’ll be waiting to see

348
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,600
how long you can keep Laplae standing.

349
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,920
Laplae has finally been freed
from the tyranny of her reign.

350
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,800
NEXT EPISODE

351
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,920
Change must begin today.

352
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,280
I propose we hold a vote to decide

353
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,720
who supports opening the town.

354
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,480
Now, I have no one left
but the two of you.

355
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,360
Please, help me escape.

356
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,560
As I promised,

357
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,320
you may take as much
golden turmeric as you wish.

358
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,320
Are you going to kick me out of town?

359
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
