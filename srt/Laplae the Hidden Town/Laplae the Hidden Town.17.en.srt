<i>Anchan!</i>

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,400
<i>Anchan lost a lot of blood</i>

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,240
<i>and died during childbirth.</i>

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,720
Her body is in the cemetery.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,600
There's just a log there.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,440
What did you and Lady Bongkod hide?

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,280
Soi, do you know how to enter the mist?

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,400
I want to meet your leader.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,440
His name is Chan.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,960
Our child.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Is devil Chan the father of my child?

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,920
Who exactly

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,680
is my mother?

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,920
Lady Healer's medicine book?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why is it with me?

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,680
Is Lady Healer not at the medicine house?

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,240
Lady Healer died.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280
How did she die?

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,280
What happened?

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,480
Why didn't I know anything?

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,680
Actually,

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
you did know everything.

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,000
What do you mean?

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,080
We're at the point

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,520
where we don’t even know
if we’ll live to see tomorrow.

30
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,000
At the very least,

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,600
could you tell me the truth?

32
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,280
Who exactly

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,200
is that town leader?

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,240
Over ten years ago,

35
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,680
I was still a patrol soldier.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,960
The authorities stationed me
at a village near here.

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,160
And that's the day

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
I met your mother.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,760
<i>Your mother was a beautiful woman,</i>

40
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,760
<i>unlike anyone I’d ever seen</i>
<i>in Phra Nakhon or anywhere else.</i>

41
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,600
<i>Our love blossomed,</i>

42
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,080
<i>and we lived together in a small cottage.</i>

43
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,440
<i>Then, your mother became pregnant.</i>

44
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
I love you so much.

45
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
<i>I was overjoyed,</i>

46
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,080
- Do you know what it is?
- What is it?

47
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,560
<i>waiting eagerly to meet my child.</i>

48
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,920
But one day,

49
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
I happened

50
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,960
to see her arguing with a friend.

51
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,840
That friend

52
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,560
said something to your mother,

53
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,000
but I couldn’t hear it.

54
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,560
<i>That night, everything seemed normal.</i>

55
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,720
Drink some tea.

56
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,640
<i>If I could go back in time,</i>

57
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,440
<i>I would have asked her everything.</i>

58
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,000
<i>Most importantly,</i>
<i>I wouldn’t fall asleep like I did,</i>

59
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,040
<i>because when I woke up,</i>

60
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,800
<i>your mother was gone.</i>

61
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,960
Bua!

62
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,080
Bua!

63
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,800
<i>I didn’t return to Phra Nakhon.</i>

64
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Bua! Where are you?

65
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,400
<i>Then,</i>

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,360
<i>I heard local herders</i>
<i>talking about a mysterious hidden town.</i>

67
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,160
<i>So I decided</i>

68
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,920
<i>to venture into the forest,</i>
<i>searching for the mist they spoke of.</i>

69
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,480
<i>It took me ages</i>

70
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,280
<i>to find that strange, thick mist</i>
<i>stretching out before me.</i>

71
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,560
<i>There was an eerie sound within it,</i>

72
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,480
<i>though I didn’t know what it was.</i>

73
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,360
I was severely injured
and spent months recovering,

74
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,320
but I never gave up
trying to get into the Town of Mist again.

75
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
<i>But this time…</i>

76
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,320
<i>This time,</i>

77
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,080
<i>I found your mother.</i>

78
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,040
She was carrying you out of the mist.

79
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,240
<i>You were born healthy and strong,</i>

80
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,480
<i>and I was thrilled.</i>

81
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,040
<i>I thought we'd return to Phra Nakhon</i>
<i>and live together as a family.</i>

82
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,840
Raise him to be like you.

83
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Wait, Bua, where are you going?

84
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,960
Forget me.

85
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,920
If you want this child to be safe,

86
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
never look for me again.

87
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,040
What do you mean Bua?

88
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,480
Bua, what do you mean?

89
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,640
That was the last day I saw your mother.

90
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,240
In my heart, I wanted to
enter that mist again to find her,

91
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
but you were still so little.

92
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,520
You were too little.

93
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,840
If I died, who would take care of you?

94
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,040
And besides, I couldn’t disobey
the orders from the authorities.

95
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,680
So I had no choice but to leave

96
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,520
and bury the past behind.

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
The town leader…

98
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,520
is my mother?

99
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,280
Yes.

100
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,280
Aunt,

101
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,120
then who is my real mother?

102
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,880
If Queen Bua
didn't go devil-hunting again,

103
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,040
how could I become her daughter?

104
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,840
I think we need to rely on Anchan.

105
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,520
Anchan’s memories will reveal everything.

106
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,960
You are the only one

107
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,720
who can brew the memory-restoring potion
from Lady Healer’s book.

108
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,360
Go heal Anchan at the rebels’ cave.

109
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Meet me tonight,

110
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,920
and I’ll take you there.

111
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,680
What do you think you’re doing?

112
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,640
I’m not going to stay here and die.

113
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,640
I’m going to find Som Po
and get her out of this town.

114
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,080
Hey.

115
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,680
Chan.

116
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,600
I'll be right back.

117
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,840
Som Po. Som Po, this way.

118
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,600
Let's go. Hurry up.

119
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,760
Som Po.

120
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
What are you going to do?

121
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,800
Wait! Where are you going?
Let me go with you.

122
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,960
You can't. Get away.

123
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Wait.

124
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,000
Please let me go with you.

125
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,920
No matter where we go,
no matter what we do,

126
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,160
I'll do anything to help Som Po.

127
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I even managed to break out of prison!

128
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,280
A devil broke out of prison! Catch him!

129
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,560
Damn it.

130
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,920
Come if you want, or we’ll all get caught.

131
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,160
Hurry up.

132
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,000
I’ve already sent someone to capture him.

133
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,360
He can’t have gotten far.

134
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,360
He doesn’t know our town well.

135
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,640
My Queen.

136
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,560
We have a serious situation.
Anchan, Angkab’s sister, is still alive.

137
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,040
She’s in the town now, with the rebels.

138
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,800
Anchan?

139
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,760
I’m the one who brought her in.

140
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,440
Let's go, hurry.

141
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,680
Chan!

142
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,920
Min, what are you doing?

143
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,920
Are you here with your father's soldiers?

144
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,240
I won’t be captured so easily.

145
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,840
Tell those Siam soldiers to back off!

146
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,840
I’m not here to capture anyone.

147
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
I just escaped from the prison.

148
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,520
He broke out of prison alone.

149
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,079
How did you get in?

150
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,000
Aunt Eungpueng brought us here.

151
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,040
This is Lady Healer’s medicine book,

152
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,839
I’m going to make
a memory-restoring potion for Aunt Anchan.

153
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Whoa, you scared me!

154
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
Take these guns and keep them with you.

155
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,840
Get familiar with them quickly

156
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,280
and prepare your forces.

157
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,800
You must go
and capture Anchan at all costs.

158
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,240
Before, we feared
that killing during a fight

159
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,360
would not be accepted by the townspeople,

160
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,560
but why this time--

161
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,200
Bring Anchan back,

162
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,040
dead or alive.

163
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
You must learn how to use these weapons.

164
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,120
My Queen, these weapons are powerful.

165
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,920
I believe they will help us
capture the rebels,

166
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,280
but my people have
only ever used knives, spears,

167
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,080
or crossbows. No one has ever used
these kinds of weapons before.

168
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,240
When I went looking for Som Po,

169
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,280
I saw the devils using them,

170
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,320
and I can teach you how.

171
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,280
Good. In that case,

172
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,120
quickly teach the wardens

173
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,120
how to use these weapons.

174
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,840
Yes my Queen.

175
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
Once the bullet is loaded,

176
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,520
aim at your target
just like with a crossbow.

177
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,840
But to fire,

178
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,920
you only need to press your finger here.

179
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,160
Try it.

180
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,480
What do I do after firing?

181
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,160
Watch me and follow along.

182
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,160
Pull it toward you,
pull back, aim, and fire.

183
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
You’re learning fast.

184
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,720
If this weapon will help crush the rebels,

185
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,880
I need to learn it quickly.

186
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,680
It’s not as hard as I thought.

187
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,920
Master this weapon well.

188
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,400
We’ll use it

189
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,960
to completely defeat the rebels.

190
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Som Po!

191
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,000
Where is Som Po?

192
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,640
Som Po! Som Po!

193
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
Lady Som Po
has been missing since the evening.

194
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
I don’t know where she went.

195
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,040
Get out!
You can’t even look after one Lady.

196
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,240
Don’t show your face to me again!

197
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,960
Queen Bua, calm down.

198
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,440
Som Po still doesn’t remember anything.

199
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,200
Even if she’s with the rebels,

200
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
she poses no threat to us.

201
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
Go to the rebels’ cave.

202
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,680
If you find Som Po, bring her back.

203
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
My Queen,

204
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,080
I can’t go back to the rebels’ cave.

205
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,360
They already know
I’ve been spying for you.

206
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,640
Yeehub!

207
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,880
Get out!
I don’t want to see your face again!

208
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,720
These herbs…

209
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,080
I can’t tell what they are for.

210
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,240
Som Po, are you sure

211
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
you can heal Anchan?

212
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,440
This medicine book
from Lady Healer Boonnak

213
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,120
contains recipes I’ve never seen before.

214
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
This page talks about
the purifying antidote,

215
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,840
so this must be
the memory-restoring potion.

216
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,320
These herbs,

217
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,160
I think I’ve seen them
around the forest nearby.

218
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,760
And is that turmeric?

219
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,120
I have one.

220
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,320
The turmeric was golden before.

221
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,480
I’ve had it with me
since before entering Laplae.

222
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,160
In that case, Min, Dahla,

223
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,600
and that Devil,

224
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,200
go gather the herbs with me.
Som Po, stay here

225
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,280
and prepare the potion for Anchan.

226
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
Watch over her
and make sure she completes it.

227
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,200
Yes, and if she tries anything
suspicious, I’ll handle it myself.

228
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,920
In that case,

229
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,640
I’ll stay here

230
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,120
to make sure Som Po isn’t in any danger.

231
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,080
- Min.
- Huh?

232
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,200
You said it was around here.

233
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
I couldn't find any.

234
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,160
Whoa!

235
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,880
Tiger herb and water pennywort

236
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,600
look so similar.
If we pick the wrong one, it won’t work.

237
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,800
Should we come back during the day?

238
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
No.

239
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,280
This mission is too important.
We must restore Anchan’s memory.

240
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,240
- Hurry up.
- Yes Mother.

241
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,920
I brought you the turmeric.

242
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,720
Thank you.

243
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,680
Now that it’s prepared like this,

244
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,520
it will be easier for me to grind it.

245
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,120
It’s unbelievable that the golden
turmeric we see outside Laplae

246
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,640
turns into ordinary turmeric here.

247
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,480
So, what should we do next?

248
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,840
Oh I see, grinding it like this.
Let me help.

249
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,040
Devil Chan.

250
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,840
You don’t need to help. Go sit over there.

251
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,600
I only wanted to help.

252
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,320
When I was sick, you made medicine for me

253
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,080
and took care of me well.

254
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,920
I just wanted to repay your kindness.

255
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,440
Whatever you’re talking about,
I don’t remember.

256
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,560
What’s in the past should stay there.

257
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,240
Right now, the important thing
is restoring Aunt Anchan’s memory.

258
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,600
If you want to be useful,

259
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,040
go help Kahla gather the herbs.

260
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,800
Alright.

261
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,160
I will…

262
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,120
go find the herbs.

263
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,920
Well.

264
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,960
I think Mr. Chan
really loves and cares for you Som Po.

265
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,920
I don’t remember anything
about this Devil Chan.

266
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,680
If the memory-restoring potion works,

267
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,200
you should take it with me.

268
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,760
That way, you’ll remember him.

269
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,120
After a Laplae woman

270
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,960
goes devil-hunting,
she must take the purifying antidote.

271
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
I…

272
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,920
don’t know why
I'd want to restore my memories.

273
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,320
It's a shame.

274
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,960
You have a good love,
but you’ve forgotten it.

275
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,000
Found it!

276
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,080
Tiger herb,
it looks exactly like in the book.

277
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,560
Yes, it's Tiger herb. Good job.

278
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,480
Hurry up.

279
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,880
Put it in the basket.

280
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,320
What’s that sound? Go check!

281
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,960
Stop!

282
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,000
Don’t try to fight.

283
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,960
You’re all under arrest.

284
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,840
No.

285
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,040
Take them to the Queen.

286
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
With just one gun and a knife,

287
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,360
you won’t stand a chance against our guns.

288
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,160
<i>Whatever you’re talking about,</i>
<i>I don’t remember.</i>

289
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,520
<i>What’s in the past should stay there.</i>

290
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,400
Are you coming with me willingly,
or would you rather die here?

291
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,960
Whoa!

292
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Who's that?

293
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
Fire!

294
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,360
Give me the bullets!

295
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,560
She’s busy reloading.

296
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Hurry, let’s get these to Som Po.

297
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,880
Stones?

298
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,360
Hold it steady
and aim, just like a crossbow.

299
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,560
Pudson.

300
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,000
Bullets.

301
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,120
- Thank you.
- Alright.

302
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,920
Eungpueng, you traitor!

303
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,400
Here it is. We've got the tiger herb.

304
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,720
Give it to me.

305
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,120
How about the others?

306
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,000
They’re waiting at the entrance,

307
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,120
making sure none of the wardens follow.

308
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,960
We almost got caught by Pudson,

309
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,000
but luckily, Devil Chan distracted them,

310
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,120
so I could bring you the herb first.

311
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,720
Som Po, I'm counting on you.

312
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,360
Kahla, you need to gather everyone

313
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,360
and get branches
to conceal the cave entrance.

314
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,640
Understood.

315
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,120
Wait, I’ll come with you.

316
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,760
Anchan, you need to stay here.

317
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,640
Once the medicine is ready,
you have to take it.

318
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,440
You’re our last hope.

319
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,640
Devil Chan, come with me.

320
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,400
We need to seal off the cave quickly.

321
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,000
Aunt Anchan,
I’ve finished making the medicine.

322
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,920
Can I take it now?

323
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,160
Yes you can.

324
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Finally, I’ll know the truth.

325
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,320
Aunt Anchan.

326
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,720
Aunt Anchan! Aunt Anchan!

327
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,960
Aunt Anchan! Wake up!

328
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,640
Aunt!

329
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,200
I bow to you my Queen.

330
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,600
Where is Anchan?

331
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,960
I… failed.

332
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,400
The rebels got away.

333
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
You’ll have another chance.

334
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,080
Gather as many wardens as you can.

335
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,040
Tonight,

336
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,360
I will lead the forces
to crush the rebels.

337
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,840
Yes my Queen.

338
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,880
It's been a long time.
Aunt Anchan still hasn’t woken up.

339
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,440
I really don’t know why.

340
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,719
Som Po, are you sure

341
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,400
you followed the recipe correctly?

342
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,800
Are you accusing Som Po
of tricking Aunt Anchan?

343
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,480
Stop it! No fighting in here, you devils!

344
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,520
Min has a point.

345
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,560
How do we know for sure
that Som Po is sincere?

346
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,760
Goya,

347
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,320
Som Po would never harm us.

348
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,120
She wants to be a healer
and loves helping people.

349
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,520
There’s no way
she’d think of hurting anyone.

350
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,840
Aunt Angkab,

351
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,280
I followed the recipe
exactly as it was written.

352
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,040
Everyone, prepare your weapons.

353
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,800
It won’t be long before we clash with Bua.

354
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,360
I’ll keep an eye on Som Po.

355
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
If Aunt Anchan doesn’t wake up by tonight,

356
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,720
maybe we can use her
as a hostage to negotiate with Queen Bua.

357
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,680
If Som Po had any ill intentions,

358
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,280
why would she make the medicine
and watch over Aunt Anchan?

359
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
Devil Chan, come with me
and prepare the weapons.

360
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
Som Po, I'm counting on you.

361
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,280
Take me to the rebels’ cave,

362
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,960
and send word to Lady Warden Pudson

363
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,680
to bring reinforcements
as soon as possible.

364
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,160
Yes my Queen.

365
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,160
The fire ahead, that’s the rebels’ cave.

366
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,400
Don’t go all the way to the cave.

367
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,080
Just close enough
to watch them fall with your own eyes.

368
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,640
Yes my Queen.

369
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,840
It’s already night,
and Aunt Anchan still hasn’t woken up.

370
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Lady Angkab will punish you for sure.

371
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,440
I’ve done all I can.

372
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,280
I followed the recipe exactly.

373
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,440
I don’t know what else to do.

374
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,240
Angkab.

375
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,360
Aunt Anchan.

376
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,400
No, Angkab…

377
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,400
Angkab…

378
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,080
Aunt Anchan has woken up.

379
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
Aunt.

380
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,360
- Bua.
- Aunt.

381
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,280
How are you feeling?

382
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
Hurry up!

383
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
Hurry up.

384
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,360
Anchan, you've woken up.

385
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,760
Angkab!

386
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,120
You're back.

387
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,120
The flute sound…

388
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,800
Aunt Eungpueng said
Queen Bua uses this flute sound

389
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,280
to summon the Mist Demon.

390
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,320
We're in trouble.

391
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,040
The Mist Demon.

392
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,240
Queen Bua has called the Mist Demon here.

393
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,200
Goya,

394
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
tell everyone to leave the cave.

395
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,520
Grab your weapons
and get out of the cave now!

396
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,920
Kahla, take Aunt Anchan and run away.

397
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,560
Min,

398
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,320
take care of Aunt Anchan,
Som Po, and Devil Chan.

399
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,960
Make sure they escape.
I'll go help my mother.

400
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,360
Wait, Kahla, what do you mean?

401
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,600
Kahla, wait.

402
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,880
You can't do this.

403
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,320
Didn’t you hear what your mother said?

404
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,840
You have to be the one taking her.

405
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,200
Right now, Aunt Anchan’s life
is the most important.

406
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,280
And what about your life?

407
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,600
What about the baby in your womb?
Don’t you see?

408
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,040
You can’t do this Kahla.

409
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,280
You're the only one I trust.

410
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,480
Please protect Aunt Anchan.

411
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,960
I'm counting on you.

412
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,080
Kahla…

413
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,760
Kahla, please, for the sake of your child
and for me.

414
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,200
Don’t do this Kahla.

415
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,600
Don’t leave me…

416
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,560
Min.

417
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,800
Trust me.

418
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,080
Then take care of yourself.

419
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,800
Go now.

420
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,080
Everyone,

421
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,080
follow me.

422
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,200
Let’s go.

423
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,000
- Be careful.
- Walk slowly.

424
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,480
NEXT EPISODE

425
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,240
I’m the younger twin of Angkab

426
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,920
and once Bua’s dearest friend.

427
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,960
Anchan, I’ve missed you so much.

428
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,240
I’m right here.

429
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,000
I truly regret

430
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,600
that your bloodline

431
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,920
must end today.

432
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,640
