4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Min said he’s going to
get the gold from the Town of Mist.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,000
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,200
This golden turmeric

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,360
will help you enter the Town of Mist,

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,320
but you must take me with you.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,880
We need to leave early in the morning
to enter Laplae.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,200
You've done well.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,520
- Let go of me.
- You caused this calamity.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,560
Apologize to Goddess Som now.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,760
Whoa!

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,400
Why didn’t you
take the purifying antidote?

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,680
And did you take it Mother?

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm still wondering

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160
how Bua knows

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,520
which one of us is a rebel.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,880
Where did they get the medicine from?

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,320
Lady Healer, my Queen.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,240
You earned this Lady Healer position

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,720
because you…

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,960
killed the previous Lady Healer.

24
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,280
I followed Queen Bongkod's order.

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,400
Mother.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,560
Since you returned from devil-hunting,

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,440
you’ve been defiant towards me.

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,880
Forget those memories
from the past months until now.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,440
I'll see you every day and every night,

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,240
in dreams and while awake.

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,640
Mother!

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Som Po.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,160
It's alright my Dear.

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,880
I've forgiven you.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,360
Purify your soul.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,320
When you wake up,

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,680
you'll be my obedient daughter again.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,480
LAPLAE THE HIDDEN TOWN

39
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,320
You witch.

40
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
What do you want?

41
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,840
I want to meet your leader.

42
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,800
We are searching for a thief.

43
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,520
We’ve heard he’s hiding here.

44
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,520
Laplae has no thieves.

45
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,120
If we can’t understand
each other like this,

46
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,040
there might be bloodshed.

47
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520
Father.

48
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,880
That lady…

49
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,560
This lady is from here.

50
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,120
She’s the one who brought us in.

51
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,200
What about Som Po? Is Som Po here?

52
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
Take us to the leader first.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,320
Follow me.

54
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,720
Please slow down. We’re not
as familiar with the path as you are.

55
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Hey.

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,480
You witch.

57
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
Slow down!

58
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,120
Whoa!

59
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,680
Follow me.

60
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,600
Whoa, I shouldn't have trusted that witch.

61
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,480
The women of this town
are truly full of deceit.

62
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,200
According to the report, the rebels
are just ahead, not too far from here.

63
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
Yes Lady.

64
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,800
Devils?

65
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,840
How did you get here?

66
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
Get out, you scum of the town!

67
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,960
Where is your leader? Take us to her.

68
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Devils!

69
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,680
Devils are here!

70
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,440
Lead the way! Hurry up!

71
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Go!

72
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,960
Lead the way!

73
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,480
Hurry up.

74
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,040
Where is your leader? Go get her.

75
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,440
You fools.

76
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,320
You have captured me.
How could I get the Queen?

77
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,280
If there is any trickery,

78
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,160
everyone will die.

79
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,800
The devils! The devils are attacking!

80
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,320
How did the devils get here?

81
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,040
Their appearance resembles

82
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
what the villagers call soldiers.

83
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,400
And though they may not be many,

84
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
all of them have the weapon

85
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
called "gun."

86
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,480
If the power of those guns
is what we’ve seen before,

87
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
I doubt our weapons
will be able to handle them.

88
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,400
Pudson, go speak to the devils

89
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,920
and tell them I invite them to my place.

90
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,200
Isn't that too dangerous my Queen?

91
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,360
Lady Teacher,

92
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,040
gather the former devil hunters
at the training house.

93
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,040
Make sure they look beautiful,
dress them well,

94
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,400
and tell the kitchen
to prepare food and alcohol.

95
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,320
Alcohol? Do we have that?

96
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,720
We do.

97
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,440
Lady Teacher, now is the time.

98
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,120
Everything you've trained
the women of Laplae for so long

99
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,120
will help protect our town.

100
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,080
I will use the finest women
from every generation for this mission.

101
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,640
Where is your leader?

102
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
Bua.

103
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,520
Do you remember me?

104
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,560
We, the people of Laplae,
only stay in our town.

105
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,600
We don't go to the outside world.

106
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,200
I'm afraid…

107
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
you must be mistaking me for someone else.

108
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,440
We only have women in our town.

109
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
And none of us means you any harm.

110
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,680
You came to our town.

111
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,400
What do you want?

112
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm looking for a woman.

113
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,760
- Her name is--
- I'm looking for

114
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,760
our enemy who sneaked in here.

115
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,960
Why did your enemy come to our town?

116
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,120
They want the golden turmeric

117
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,680
to trade for weapons to fight us.

118
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,680
If that's the case,

119
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,120
we will gladly help capture

120
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,680
and return them to you.

121
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,400
But I also want the golden turmeric.

122
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,840
My Queen.

123
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,000
You all must be exhausted
from your journey.

124
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,360
According to Laplae's customs,

125
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,040
we always warmly welcome our guests

126
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,760
with food, drink,

127
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,200
and the hospitality of our women.

128
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,000
Please rest well,

129
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,560
and we can discuss
important matters later.

130
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,720
Yeehub.

131
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,680
I feel so dizzy.

132
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
Please rest Som Po.

133
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,640
You’ve just returned to Laplae
from devil-hunting.

134
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,960
You've successfully gotten pregnant
and taken the purifying antidote.

135
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,200
It’s natural to feel dizzy
for most of the day.

136
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Pregnant?

137
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,160
Yes. Your friends

138
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,960
are all at their homes
nurturing their little ones too.

139
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,240
And what about Kahla?

140
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
She’s resting as well.

141
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,520
I’ll be right back,
I need to see the Queen first.

142
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
You just rest.

143
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,760
Don’t think about anything else.
You’ve yet to recover from the antidote.

144
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,680
Alright.

145
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,440
Lady Healer's medicine book?

146
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
Why is it with me?

147
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
Anchan.

148
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,520
If the townspeople see
Lady Guardian's twin is still alive,

149
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,000
they will finally realize
that it was Bua who deceived them.

150
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,120
Anchan, how did you

151
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,880
return to our town?
Have you regained your memory?

152
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,200
No, I still don’t remember anything.

153
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,640
The Siamese soldiers brought me, and then…

154
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,000
The devils want me
to take them to the Queen.

155
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,200
I thought if I took them,
Anchan might be in danger.

156
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,440
Thank you.

157
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,480
If Bua finds Anchan,

158
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,520
she won’t let her live.

159
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,080
Bua? Who is that?

160
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,040
And why does she want to kill me?

161
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,320
I wish I had the answer too.

162
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,200
Please drink this.

163
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,920
Cheers.

164
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,560
Chan.

165
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,680
Stay focused.

166
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,720
Do you know a woman named Som Po?

167
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,120
My name is Baikhao.

168
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
I’m here to take care of you,

169
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,920
so why are you asking for someone else?

170
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,600
I’d prefer to just sit
and enjoy the atmosphere.

171
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,960
You can go take care of someone else.

172
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,240
Why are you pushing me away like this?

173
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,680
I said go.

174
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,200
That devil keeps asking for Som Po,

175
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
ignoring the other women of Laplae.

176
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,160
And how is Som Po?

177
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,280
She took the antidote

178
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,480
and has forgotten
everything outside of Laplae.

179
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,720
Why are there devils in the town?

180
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
The devils snuck in,

181
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
but thanks to the Queen's abilities,
she pretended to welcome them.

182
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,120
The Queen and the Teacher
want you to use your skills

183
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,320
to help protect our town as well.

184
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,920
Yes, even though you’ve forgotten
the world outside,

185
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,120
you still remember everything you learned
about devil-hunting, right?

186
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,280
I remember.

187
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,960
Then quickly get dressed

188
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,320
and use your skills for the town.

189
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
Alright.

190
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,800
What is your name?

191
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,720
- My name is--
- Som Po.

192
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,960
It’s really you!

193
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,400
I’ve finally found you.

194
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,720
I’ve missed you so much.

195
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,840
Oh, we’ve just met for the first time,

196
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,200
and you’re saying you missed me.

197
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,480
Are you trying to deceive me
with sweet words?

198
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,040
It is indeed

199
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,120
a great honor for us,
the people of Laplae,

200
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,880
to welcome the Siamese warriors,
and build a friendship.

201
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,080
If you’ve eaten well

202
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,640
and wish to rest,

203
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,520
we’ve prepared
a cozy room for you to relax in,

204
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
and the women of Laplae

205
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
will take care of you
throughout the night.

206
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,480
As for you,

207
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,120
you're also invited to rest in your room.

208
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,840
- Dokkaew.
- Yes my Queen.

209
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,960
- Take care of him.
- Yes my Queen.

210
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,880
I won't go with this lady.

211
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,640
But I'll go with you.

212
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
Ah.

213
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,480
I've been so worried.

214
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,320
How is our baby?

215
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,560
Baby?

216
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,600
Yes, our baby.

217
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,960
Are you

218
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,880
the devil I copulated with?

219
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,800
Yes.

220
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,200
I don’t remember.

221
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,640
What do you mean?

222
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,520
When we return to Laplae,
we must take the purifying antidote.

223
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,000
It makes us forget everything
beyond the town.

224
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,400
I want to know
what I’ve been made to forget.

225
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,440
Can you help me?

226
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,800
I've missed you.

227
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,360
I've really missed you.

228
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
I thought…

229
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,680
this day would never come.

230
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,520
I was so shocked.

231
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,360
I never expected

232
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,200
the person in front of me to be you.

233
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,760
I must apologize to you

234
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,840
for having to hide

235
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,400
and act indifferent towards you
in front of the townspeople.

236
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,680
Even though

237
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,280
I longed to embrace you,

238
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,120
I had to uphold my role as the Queen.

239
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,000
It's alright.

240
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,440
After all,

241
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,760
the ten long years of waiting

242
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,480
will finally come to an end today.

243
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,320
Is it the scar from back then?

244
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,080
Yes.

245
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,800
Even if it cost me my life,

246
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,040
I had to get through that mist

247
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,640
to find you.

248
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,680
I won’t fall for your tricks so easily.

249
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,400
Bua must not die peacefully.

250
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,200
Songpeep and our friends
got sick and died in jail.

251
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,480
We need to keep moving forward quickly.

252
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,680
I want us

253
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,640
to focus on restoring Anchan’s memory.

254
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,840
How can my sister,
who died after giving birth,

255
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,840
be alive here?

256
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,200
This is solid proof

257
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,800
that Bua

258
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,440
has been lying to us all along.

259
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
Most importantly,

260
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,960
Bua must not find out

261
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,760
that Aunt Anchan is with us.

262
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,880
When we were caught collecting medicine,

263
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,920
how did they know we were picking it up?

264
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,800
I strongly suspect
we have a traitor among us.

265
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,000
Whose turn was it
to fetch the water that day?

266
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,680
Yeehub.

267
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,680
Yeehub?

268
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,240
Yeehub?

269
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,600
She’s not here?

270
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,320
We need to flee quickly. By now, Yeehub

271
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,960
must have informed Bua
that Aunt Anchan is with us.

272
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,440
It won’t be long before
she sends someone to capture us.

273
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,880
What's the matter?

274
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,920
Is devil Chan

275
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,240
the father of my child?

276
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,880
What did you just say?

277
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,160
He said, when I went devil-hunting,

278
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,640
we met.

279
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,640
And he's the father of the child
I carry in my womb.

280
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,720
But I can't remember anything.

281
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,280
You can't trust what the devils say.

282
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,240
Don’t fall for their tricks.

283
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,120
You’ve done an excellent job today.

284
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,280
We’ll soon drive them out of Laplae.

285
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,440
Father,

286
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,120
you know

287
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,160
the Queen of this town, right?

288
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,840
I've noticed it many times.

289
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,400
You seem to know Laplae well.

290
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,720
From the mist,

291
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,360
Aunt Anchan,

292
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
and what surprises me the most

293
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,720
is that you called the Queen

294
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,360
"Bua."

295
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,360
And that young man…

296
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
His name is Chan.

297
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,800
Chan.

298
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,760
Our child.

299
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Who exactly

300
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,880
is my mother?

301
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,640
NEXT EPISODE

302
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,520
Take these guns and keep them with you.

303
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,120
Get familiar with them quickly.

304
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
I won’t be captured so easily.

305
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,320
This medicine book
from Lady Healer Boonnak

306
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,680
contains medicine recipes
I’ve never seen before.

307
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,960
So, what should we do next?

308
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,720
Anchan’s memories

309
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,640
will reveal everything.
