1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,919
(Presents)

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,609
(Hot Love Issue)

9
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,480
This is Tul,

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,719
my ex-boyfriend.
The one I told you about.

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,320
I have a mole on the inside.

12
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,679
I was recently informed
that CJ is committing fraud.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,480
Meanwhile, I need you
to distract her

14
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,210
from this investigation.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,359
The new owner is asking you
to move out within three days.

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,000
Who's this new owner?

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,560
Why are they so heartless?

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,799
That would be me.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,679
I'm giving you three days.

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,280
Hurry up and move out.

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,439
It was your doing, wasn't it?

22
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,840
A sexual deviant?

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
That's right! I'm a sexual deviant!

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,359
So why won't you leave me alone?

25
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,280
CJ.

26
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,919
What's wrong?
Why are you making that face?

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm shocked. I didn't expect Irene
to throw such a tantrum.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
I feel bad.

29
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,810
You've got me at a loss for words.

30
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,879
You are smiling
despite the intense situation.

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,919
I'm smiling because
my plan succeeded.

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Listen.

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,159
Now, we have to spread the rumor

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,680
that Irene and her mother
are fighting.

35
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,240
CJ couldn't accept Irene's
sexual orientation,

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,039
so Irene insulted her at the office

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,400
and caused a scene.

38
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,960
Let's turn the whole
company against Irene.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,919
Is that all?

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Of course not.

41
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,280
The deal abroad that
we gave Irene will never take place.

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
They will email to
cancel the deal soon.

43
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,319
I told them that Irene stole
the project from me.

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,439
They aren't happy about it.

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
You are a devil.

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,400
No, that's not all.

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,599
There's also the fraud
that CJ committed.

48
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,879
Watch me destroy CJ and Irene.

49
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,039
You are

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,800
pure evil.

51
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,240
I'll take that as a compliment.

52
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
(Passport)

53
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,610
Where are you, Night?

54
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,439
What did my mother do to you?

55
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,319
Aunt Jo.

56
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,279
Irene's back. We have to run away.

57
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,439
Run where?

58
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,959
My old workplace won't take me back.

59
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,959
We have nowhere to go.

60
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Why don't we

61
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
move to the countryside?

62
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,839
We can go anywhere.

63
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,040
I have some money saved up.

64
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,279
It will last us a month or two.

65
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
In the meantime,
we can find a new job.

66
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
Please, Aunt Jo.

67
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,480
Night, are you done packing?

68
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,079
Listen.

69
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Take only what you need.

70
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,519
We have the place
until the end of the month.

71
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
We can come back
for our stuff later.

72
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,879
- I see.
- Come on. I'll help you.

73
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,959
We can't miss the bus.

74
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,319
Night.

75
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,959
Night, what's wrong? Night!

76
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,240
You are burning up. Night!

77
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,399
Night.

78
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
Night, what's wrong?

79
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,319
Night.

80
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,839
Aunt Jo.

81
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,680
Is anyone inside? Night?

82
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,759
Irene.

83
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,959
- Aunt Jo.
- Irene.

84
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,759
Irene, Night needs help.

85
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,040
Is anyone inside?

86
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,839
Aunt Jo.

87
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Irene, you have to help Night.

88
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,800
What's wrong with Night?

89
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,120
She fainted and she's burning up.

90
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
What?

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,319
Hurry.

92
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,879
Thank you.

93
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Night.

94
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,959
You're awake.

95
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,840
Aunt Jo.

96
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,330
What happened to me?

97
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,639
You have a fever.

98
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,159
Aunt Jo said

99
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,519
you had been crying nonstop
and starving yourself.

100
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,559
Aunt Jo.

101
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,679
Night.

102
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,879
Do you feel better now?

103
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,450
Let Irene take you to see a doctor.

104
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,450
I'm fine.

105
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,279
I don't need a doctor.

106
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Our bus is leaving soon.

107
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,399
We should go.

108
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,639
Night.

109
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,210
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying here.

110
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,960
You can't run away from me,

111
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,720
no matter how hard you try.

112
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,159
Listen to her.

113
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,759
If you won't see a doctor,
then take some medicine

114
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,639
and get some rest.

115
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,519
We'll figure something out later.

116
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,450
Good girl.

117
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,960
Listen to me and do as I say.

118
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,450
It's best for you.

119
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,090
Get some rest.

120
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,759
Freeze Irene's credit cards

121
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,200
and all of her bank accounts.

122
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,159
Cut her off.

123
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,039
Soon,

124
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,600
you will come crawling back to me,

125
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Irene.

126
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Night.

127
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,440
You're up.

128
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,200
Your temperature is normal now.

129
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,039
Are you hungry?

130
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,559
Aunt Jo made you porridge.

131
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,639
I'll get some for you.

132
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,320
Wait, Irene.

133
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,879
We need to talk.

134
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,240
Let's break up.

135
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Did you hear me? Let's break up.

136
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,919
Break up?

137
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,279
Why?

138
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Because...

139
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,039
I'll agree only if it's because
you don't love me anymore.

140
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,440
But if this is about someone else,

141
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,159
I'm not breaking up with you.

142
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,320
We can't be together.

143
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
Don't you understand?

144
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,960
You and I will never happen.

145
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,559
Everything's ruined.

146
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,000
It's over.

147
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,600
It's my fault
for falling in love with you.

148
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,080
Calm down.

149
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,159
Do you remember when I said...

150
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,960
I will always stand by you,

151
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,559
no matter what?

152
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,720
Just do as I say.

153
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,559
No.

154
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,559
We're not breaking up.

155
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,240
Let go.

156
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,279
I have nothing left.

157
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,720
I don't have any money.

158
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,559
My mother has seized
all my bank accounts

159
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,600
and cut ties with me.

160
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,440
I can't go back to work either

161
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,879
because people are saying

162
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,759
that I physically assaulted
my own mother.

163
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,720
Don't you see?

164
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,080
I ruined your life again.

165
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,759
I hurt Aunt Jo too.

166
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,960
Her beloved bar

167
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,799
that she built from the ground

168
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,120
is closed because of me.

169
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,519
Other horrible things
will happen to you

170
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,480
if we keep dating.

171
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,240
Why, Night?

172
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,879
Why are you choosing

173
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,480
to let go of my hand instead of
holding onto it even tighter?

174
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,399
Let's go our own way and start anew.

175
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,519
Your mother will forgive you

176
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,519
and give everything back to you

177
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,799
if you break up with me.

178
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,559
Aunt Jo and I

179
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,519
will find a new place to live.

180
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,320
I need a fresh start too.

181
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,919
No, Night.

182
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
Don't break up with me.

183
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,159
We can get through this together.

184
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm not letting go of your hand.

185
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,200
What should I do?

186
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,120
What should I do now?

187
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,839
Farewell, Irene.

188
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,799
Can't you help me out, Sarah?

189
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,240
Convince Madame to take me back.

190
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,359
Night and I are in a bad place.

191
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,119
If she thinks
I'm too old to perform,

192
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,839
I'm happy to be
a makeup artist backstage.

193
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,799
Yes.

194
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,240
Night.

195
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Night.

196
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,839
I have to go. I'll call you back.

197
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,680
What's wrong?

198
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,839
Aunt Jo.

199
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,480
Night ran away.

200
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,960
As long as I'm here,

201
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,200
you won't be able to forget me.

202
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,410
It's best that I leave.

203
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,359
Goodbye, Irene.

204
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,279
Darn it, Night.

205
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,119
Why didn't you tell me first?

206
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
Don't worry.

207
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,170
I will find her.

208
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,720
How?

209
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,650
I don't know.

210
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,559
I'll start by searching
the bus stations.

211
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,839
She can't be far.

212
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,720
Let's go. I'll come with you.

213
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,079
It's okay. You should wait here.

214
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,200
I'll contact you right away
if I find her.

215
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,279
I'm counting on you.

216
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,279
Don't worry.

217
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,960
I promise

218
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,319
I will bring her back.

219
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,799
I'll get ready then.

220
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,279
Aunt Jo.

221
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,039
What brings you here?

222
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,960
Can you take me
to see Irene's mother?

223
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,440
I...

224
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,359
What business do you have with her?

225
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,480
It's none of your business.

226
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,720
Just take me to her.

227
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Don't bother begging.

228
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,519
I won't let you keep the bar.

229
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,759
I'm not here to talk about the bar.

230
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,410
I'm here to talk about Irene.

231
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,559
Why?

232
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,170
Did she send you?

233
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,960
She must be struggling financially.

234
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,960
Nobody sent me.

235
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,720
I came because I wanted to.

236
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,079
Say what you came to say then.

237
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,519
I don't have time for your nonsense.

238
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,170
Time is money for me.

239
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,170
CJ.

240
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,559
Do you remember

241
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,960
how you felt when you were
pregnant with Irene?

242
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,599
Just get to the point.
Don't beat around the bush.

243
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,240
Do you remember

244
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,960
how much you loved that girl?

245
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,279
You still loved her
whenever she misbehaved

246
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,839
because she was your daughter.

247
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,720
But now,

248
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:25,079
she is a woman who loves women.

249
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,279
Is that a good enough reason
for you to hate her?

250
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,650
It's none of your business.

251
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,920
She's my daughter.

252
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,599
You might be her mother,
but you don't own her.

253
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,359
It's her life.

254
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,410
She gets to decide what she wants.

255
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,890
Over my dead body.

256
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,720
Life is short.

257
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,880
Why make her wait that long

258
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,200
just to be happy?

259
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,039
You can let her be happy now.

260
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,119
Hey.

261
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,680
Who are you to lecture me?

262
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,319
CJ.

263
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm a nobody.

264
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,559
I'm a father who loves her daughter
and wants to see her happy.

265
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,279
I'm not here

266
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,160
to ask you for anything.

267
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
I just want you to open your heart

268
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,440
and let our daughters
be happy together.

269
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,079
I might not have money

270
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,680
or power...

271
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,680
but I have always had dignity
and honor as a transwoman.

272
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,079
However,

273
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,160
I'm ready to lose my dignity

274
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,759
and do anything you say.

275
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,319
Please let our girls
be happy together.

276
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,160
Please give them
a chance to be happy.

277
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm begging you.

278
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,279
I want you to reconsider
your decision carefully

279
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,039
before you lose Irene forever.

280
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,839
CJ, the board has requested
an urgent meeting.

281
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,519
Apparently,
a fraud has been reported.

282
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,519
- Aunt Jo.
- Irene.

283
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,480
Any sign of Night?

284
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,119
Not at all.

285
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,000
But don't worry.

286
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,039
I'll hire a detective
to look for her.

287
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,640
But...

288
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,799
But what?

289
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,759
It's expensive.

290
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,599
I don't have money now, Aunt Jo.

291
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,319
Do you have any?

292
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,119
Money?

293
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,400
Sell this. You'll get a lot for it.

294
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,960
I'll ask for help from some friends
if it's not enough.

295
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:54,039
But we have to find Night
no matter what.

296
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,920
I'm sorry, Aunt Jo.

297
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,960
I caused you all this trouble.

298
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,440
No, don't blame yourself.

299
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,400
When we're happy,
we share the happiness.

300
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,440
And when we're struggling,

301
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,039
we have to hold hands
and get through it together.

302
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,279
It's me who should be thanking you

303
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,799
for always staying with me
through thick and thin.

304
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,119
I'd probably be in a worse shape

305
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
without you as well.

306
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,359
Why is Tul bothering me now?

307
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,920
Why didn't you answer?
It might be important.

308
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,880
Irene, have you heard the news?

309
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,319
About what?

310
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,920
The board wants to investigate CJ
about fraud in the company.

311
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,240
She's been suspended and forbidden
to come into her office.

312
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,279
And that includes you too.

313
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,599
You've been forbidden
to come in as well.

314
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,279
What should we do?

315
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,920
Just forget it.

316
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't care anymore.

317
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,759
But your mother
might go to jail for this.

318
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,319
Why did you call me?
What do you actually want?

319
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,039
I don't think it's safe
to discuss it on the phone.

320
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,599
Let's do it this way.

321
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,799
Meet me tomorrow at this hotel.
I'll send you the location.

322
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,200
Well done, Tul.

323
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,359
We'll be able
to settle this tomorrow.

324
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,480
Her end is our beginning, isn't it?

325
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,960
Hello. Are you still
looking for a bartender?

326
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:19,880
Should I send an email
to the address in the post?

327
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,599
And when will I hear back...

328
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,680
Night?

329
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,279
Don't worry about me, Aunt Jo.
I'm fine.

330
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,240
I'll come and get you
once I've found a job.

331
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,200
"Don't tell Irene that
I messaged you."

332
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,559
Oh, Night. Why are you doing this?

333
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
Why did you turn your phone off?

334
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,440
CJ.

335
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,599
I'm here to talk
about our daughters.

336
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,920
I have nothing left now.

337
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,319
I don't have a reputation
to maintain anymore.

338
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,279
You're punctual, Irene.

339
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,799
Hurry up and say what you want.

340
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,480
I don't have all day.

341
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,519
Are you going to find Night?
I don't think you'll find her.

342
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,359
Can you stay out of this?

343
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,400
Come on. Be nice.

344
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,680
I don't want to be nice.
Is there a problem?

345
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
So, what's the matter?

346
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,319
If you don't want
your mother to go to jail...

347
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,319
Sign this acknowledgment form

348
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
and pay off the debt.

349
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,440
It's a lot though.

350
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,759
The money your mother embezzled.

351
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,799
Who are you calling?

352
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,799
I'm calling the company's
legal team, of course.

353
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,920
I'm curious as to
why you're handling this matter.

354
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,599
Because I think you have a temper,
so I'm handling it on your behalf.

355
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,440
It will be faster too.

356
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,000
Put your phone away, Irene.

357
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,359
I said put it away!

358
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,640
Tell me.

359
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,400
What exactly did my mom do?

360
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,519
Nothing fraudulent.

361
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,960
It's a grey area. Nothing illegal.

362
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,400
But Faye sympathizes with her.

363
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,119
So instead of the grey area,

364
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,240
she forged the documents
and turned it black.

365
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,519
She turned something
innocent into a crime.

366
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,440
You're conspiring with Faye?

367
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,680
That's right.
We're conspiring together.

368
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,000
Surprise.

369
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,079
You're such a scumbag.

370
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,200
What have you both done?

371
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,759
Just a tiny bit of document forgery.

372
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,559
Would you like to see it?
It's on this tablet.

373
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,160
But you have to sign the form
before I can let you see it.

374
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,640
So? What do you want me to sign?

375
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,079
And if I sign it,
my mom won't go to jail, right?

376
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I guarantee
that everything will be all right.

377
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,039
It's time you met your match.

378
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,240
You think you're so tough?

379
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,519
Don't you act all tough with me.

380
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,720
Come here.

381
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,599
You think you're so tough?

382
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,079
I won't tolerate any lip
from someone like you!

383
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,239
You and Faye are going to jail!

384
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,440
Irene, where have you been?
I was worried about you.

385
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,480
And how did it go with Tul?

386
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,920
Are you okay?

387
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,519
I'm fine, Aunt Jo.

388
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:14,079
I just went through
something horrible

389
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:16,960
and felt like hugging someone.

390
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,159
Mom?

391
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,920
How did you get here?

392
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,840
Irene?

393
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,289
What happened to you?

394
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,000
Why is your skin red?

395
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,360
Tul hurt me.

396
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,480
Tul, you scumbag!

397
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,239
Are you okay? Does it hurt anywhere?

398
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,679
I'm okay, Aunt Jo.

399
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,769
It's Tul who's in bad shape.

400
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,769
I beat him up real bad.

401
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,599
What's this?

402
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,440
There's evidence that Tul and Faye
framed you on there.

403
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,440
And in that bag

404
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,239
is medicine and a medical
certificate from a doctor.

405
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,559
I went to get a check-up
as proof of physical assault.

406
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,719
I'll send you the video clip too.

407
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,360
You can deal
with everything yourself.

408
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,159
I don't want
to be part of this anymore.

409
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,840
Irene,

410
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,440
please be nice to her.

411
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,519
She understands everything now.

412
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,679
Aunt Jo, I don't want
to discuss this anymore.

413
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:03,400
The only thing I want to know is

414
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,039
where Night is right now.

415
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,769
Irene.

416
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,920
Night?

417
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,880
You came back for me?

418
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,960
Do you know what Tul did to me?

419
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:54,239
I was scared
I wouldn't get to see you again.

420
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:58,039
But when I thought of you,

421
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,679
I struggled and did everything
so I'd survive.

422
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,599
Don't leave me again.

423
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,039
Please.

424
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,400
I'm sorry, Irene.

425
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:20,119
I was thinking too much

426
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,199
and was anxious about everything.

427
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,480
Then I decided to leave you.

428
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,840
But now, I've realized

429
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,519
how important you are to me.

430
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,119
I'll never leave you, Irene.

431
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:02,440
Let me have a look at you.

432
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,159
What did Tul do to you?
Are you hurt anywhere?

433
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,719
I'll blow all the pain away.

434
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,809
Here. Here. Here. And here.

435
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,719
Right here too.

436
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,000
Whoa, let me see.

437
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,599
That's quite red.

438
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,880
Please don't do that again, okay?

439
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,039
I'll blow the pain away.

440
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,329
Better?

441
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,840
Don't be naughty again, okay?

442
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,960
And how did you get back?

443
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,329
This morning,

444
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,960
I texted Aunt Jo.

445
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,960
- And CJ...
- You can call me "Mom".

446
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,199
She had someone track down
my phone signal

447
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:08,809
and found my whereabouts.

448
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,920
So she brought me back.

449
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,769
Now that you're back,
don't disappear again, okay?

450
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,079
Mm.

451
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,840
Irene,

452
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,480
aren't you going
to thank your mom at all?

453
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,079
She actually convinced me
to come back.

454
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,519
Thank you, Mom!

455
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,769
Thanks, Irene.

456
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,119
I never saw you smile
or be this happy before.

457
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,719
I understand everything now.

458
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,440
What do you understand?

459
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,400
I understand...

460
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,239
that I should be supportive
so you can be happy,

461
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,679
and not get in the way
of your happiness.

462
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,079
At last, you got
your happy ending, Night.

463
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,079
We're very happy for you.

464
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,360
Thank you, Aoy and Chod.

465
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,360
Both Tul and Faye are facing
the consequences of their actions.

466
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,440
They probably won't be able to
cause us trouble anymore.

467
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,920
Aren't you going to sleep?

468
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,960
I will.

469
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:02,840
I'm just thinking
about random things.

470
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:06,119
You can go ahead and sleep.

471
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,079
Don't you have an early start
tomorrow, Ms. Executive?

472
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,599
Mm.

473
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:16,840
Goodnight.

474
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:20,289
That's a goodnight kiss.

475
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,599
Goodnight.

476
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,159
Aoy, Chod,

477
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,519
I feel like this is the moment
I can finally be happy.

478
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,329
(JOANNE BAR)

479
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,760
Hello, Irene? You've arrived?

480
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,119
Tell me when you get here.

481
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,280
I'll make you a Cocktail Irene.

482
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,519
I just parked the car.
I'm about to head inside.

483
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,239
Oh, but can you make me two?
I brought a friend.

484
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,719
A friend?

485
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,599
Who is it?

486
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,000
Irene.

487
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,920
Hello, Mom.

488
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,599
Hi there.

489
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,679
Night, your story is an example
for many other couples

490
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,760
that if two people
truly love each other,

491
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,519
and hold each other's hand
tightly enough,

492
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:50,760
they'll get through whatever
horrible things life throws at them.

493
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,719
Exactly. And a strong foundation
for love starts with your family.

494
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:58,800
Apart from your love for each other,

495
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,800
please don't forget to look after
CJ and Joanne

496
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,440
because they're also the people
who love you both the most.

497
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,719
Thank you both again
for listening to my story.

498
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,960
I'm just a simple woman
who's been bullied

499
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,559
and has faced terrible accusations
her whole life.

500
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,119
I've realized that those words

501
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
won't have any effect on our lives

502
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
if we are strong enough

503
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,039
and aware that the people
we love will always be by our side

504
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,280
to hold our hand.

505
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,559
Just like me, I have Aunt Jo,

506
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,920
CJ, and Irene.

507
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,960
You should accept the person
you love for who they are,

508
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,800
and not force them
to be what you wish to see.

509
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,280
Why are you back at work, Foon?

510
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,199
Don't you have to
handle the funeral?

511
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,559
Whose funeral? What happened?

512
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,079
How come you don't
remember anything?

513
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,239
My son died because of you!

514
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,519
Tell me what I did to Gap, Mom.

515
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,599
Don't you regret or feel guilty
at all for having an affair

516
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:21,760
with your friend's wife?

517
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,480
Get out! I can't stand
being with you anymore!

518
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:28,159
Maybe I cheated on Gap

519
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,639
and caused him to kill himself?

520
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,079
All right. Smack!

521
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:38,239
Hold it like this.

522
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,960
- What happened?
- When I fell over,

523
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,079
I twisted my leg and couldn't keep
my balance. Then he fell over,

524
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,920
and I fell down as well.

525
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,880
Two. There!

526
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,199
All right. One, two, three.

527
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,119
Give me a "like".
One, two, three. Good.
