1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,919
(Presents)

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,609
(Hot Love Issue)

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,039
Wait. Are you saying
you will be my girlfriend?

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Yes.

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,760
I have a girlfriend!

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,359
The person I'm taking you to meet
is your competitor.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,119
Do anything
in your power to defeat her.

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,640
Understand?

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,640
My assistant texted me to say
Faye's been deceiving the board

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,439
about me dating a woman.

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,759
What are you doing?
I’m not a lesbian like you.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,679
See? I haven’t even said anything.

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,079
You blurted it out yourself.

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,439
It's my business and not yours.

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,640
Don’t be nosy.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Get out.

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,280
- Irene, what happened?
- Get out.

24
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,640
Curious? Go in there and find out.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,049
Get out! I said get out!

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,319
Get out!

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,769
Hello, Night? Can you make me
a Cocktail Irene?

28
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,519
I feel like celebrating.

29
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,049
I’ll come over to see you now.

30
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,239
Irene, where are you going?

31
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,799
Get out.

32
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,439
I said get out.

33
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,640
- Get out!
- Stop it!

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,400
Enough with the act.
Everyone's gone.

35
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,040
Am I a great actress or what?

36
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,799
You said you were just going to
provoke Irene to cause a scene.

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,239
It has turned into a bigger problem.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,120
I didn't know she was
going to react this way.

39
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,840
At first, I was only planning to
argue with her loudly in a toilet.

40
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,560
But this is good in a way.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,840
People love scandals.

42
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,840
Let's hope every employee,

43
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,680
including the executives,
hear about today's incident.

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,919
Darn it.

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,120
I shouldn't have told you
that Irene used to do drugs abroad

46
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,370
and date girls.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,879
I'm screwed.

48
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,879
What should I do?

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,530
Don't do anything.
What's the worst that could happen?

50
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,840
How can you say that?

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,530
Let's end this partnership.

52
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,199
Being in the same boat
will only sink us both.

53
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,090
I'm getting nothing out of this.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Tul.

55
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,639
Think about it.
We've come a long way.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,599
Don't give up so easily.

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,599
Think about it. If you help me

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,479
until I take down CJ and Irene,

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,879
I will possess power and money.

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,319
When that time comes,

61
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,919
I promise to support you.

62
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,000
On the other hand,

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,840
if you choose to support CJ,

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,199
you will be nothing more

65
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,479
than her underling,
running after that brat, Irene.

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Your career won't grow.

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,840
Fine.

68
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,560
I'll work with you one last time.

69
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,199
If things go south again,
I'll terminate this partnership.

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Do whatever you want.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
What do you need me to do?

72
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,879
Cause a fight between Irene
and her girlfriend.

73
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,840
Here's the shirt, Tul.

74
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,879
Irene!

75
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,199
Let go. I'm embarrassed.

76
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,610
I'm not, and I won't let go.

77
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,920
Irene, let me go.

78
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,439
What's with that face?
Are you embarrassed?

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,279
No.

80
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,959
I was worried about you,
but you're just fooling around.

81
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,639
How did it go?

82
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,319
It went well.
It's me we're talking about.

83
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,759
You have nothing to worry about.

84
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,920
You're scrunching your eyebrows.

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,199
I'm relieved to hear that.

86
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,399
I forgot

87
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,519
how smart my girlfriend was.

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,360
I deserve a reward then.

89
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,519
What?

90
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,959
Poke.

91
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,170
You pranked me again.

92
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,680
Irene, it tickles.

93
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,730
Irene. Wait.

94
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,639
Stop. It tickles.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Night.

96
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,399
Tul.

97
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
Night, are you okay?

98
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm fine. Let's go.

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
Why is your hand so cold?

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
Are you okay?

101
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,680
Tul.

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,199
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,279
Do you know

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,199
Night?

105
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,279
Do you want to tell her?

106
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,240
Or should I?

107
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,439
This is Tul,

108
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,759
my ex-boyfriend.

109
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,279
The one I told you about.

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
I see.

111
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,800
That sucky boyfriend of yours?

112
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,079
What a small world.

113
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,639
Tul happens to be my assistant.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
This puts me

115
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,160
in an awkward position, doesn't it?

116
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
No, it doesn't.

117
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,399
We'll talk about it later. Let's go.

118
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,120
What's the rush, Night?

119
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,519
Did you tell Irene

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,600
how you begged me

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,639
to get back together with you

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,000
for months after we broke up?

123
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,040
When I refused to see you,
you texted me every single day.

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,319
You even nearly cut ties

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,480
with Aunt Jo to be with me.

126
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,240
Stop falsely accusing me, Tul.

127
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,519
I'm not accusing you.

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,199
It's the truth.

129
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,199
Tul, shut up.

130
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,680
Enough about the past.

131
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,759
Night and I are dating now.

132
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,439
Stay away from our relationship.

133
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
It's an order.

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
I'm sorry, Irene.

135
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,639
I'll stop talking about the past.

136
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,480
Congratulations on
your new relationship, Night.

137
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,360
I find your family interesting.

138
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,120
Your father is transgender,

139
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,959
and you are a lesbian.

140
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,959
I'm truly happy for you.

141
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,439
I really am.

142
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,319
Hey.

143
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,199
Don't you touch her.

144
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,000
Stop talking down on her.

145
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,639
Get lost.

146
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,439
Go.

147
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,039
Night.

148
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,480
Say something.

149
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,519
You've been quiet
the whole way back.

150
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,330
If you need someone to talk to,

151
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,559
I'm here for you.

152
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,960
Are you still hung up on Tul?

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,240
It's not about him.

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,600
I just feel guilty

155
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,450
for mistreating Aunt Jo in the past.

156
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,450
I blamed her identity

157
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,639
for

158
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,330
my failed love life.

159
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,360
How could I be so stupid?

160
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,210
I chose a jerk like Tul...

161
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,330
over someone
who cherished me like Aunt Jo.

162
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,799
Everyone has made
mistakes before, Night.

163
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,120
Look at me.

164
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm a fully grown adult,
but I still mess up.

165
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,159
I just feel like I was
ungrateful toward her.

166
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,320
Let the past be the past.

167
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,279
You take great care of her now.

168
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,399
And she's very proud of you.

169
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,600
Stop worrying and blaming yourself.

170
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,519
Trust me.

171
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,279
I'll try.

172
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,679
Hey.

173
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
Are you sure you won't get
in trouble because of me?

174
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,039
Tul works at your company.

175
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,440
Are you not going to lose him?

176
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,919
He's just a person my mother sent
to follow me around.

177
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,360
I can fire him anytime.

178
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,639
Don't worry.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,480
Come on, untangle those brows.

180
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Come here.

181
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,399
Here.

182
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
Smile.

183
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Okay.

184
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,559
Thank you.

185
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Sure.

186
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,600
How can you be so stupid?

187
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,120
I told you to cause a fight between
them, not have them gang up on you.

188
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,879
Darn it.

189
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,559
Everything's ruined.

190
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,200
I shouldn't have teamed up with you.

191
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,200
CJ is going to fire me now.

192
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,080
If not, then Irene is going to fire
me for talking to Night like that.

193
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,440
It won't come to that.

194
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,039
They won't fire you.

195
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
Why won't they?

196
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,759
I'm just a lowly employee.
I don't mean anything to them.

197
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,080
Me obtaining power
in the company like you said

198
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,320
might not ever happen.

199
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,799
Having a stable job is enough.

200
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,919
There's no need to be an executive.

201
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Listen.

202
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,159
Don't give up yet, Tul.

203
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,519
Don't forget that
other executives have my back.

204
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,480
CJ is the only one in my way.

205
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,679
We'll find a way to get rid of her.

206
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,840
You said CJ moved up her flight
to arrive this evening, right?

207
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,399
Yes.

208
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,080
She told me to meet at her place.

209
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,279
Good.

210
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,360
I have another plan.

211
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,279
I'm done listening to you.

212
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,120
Tul.

213
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,519
Don't give up yet.

214
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,200
You have to help me.

215
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,559
Don't you want a better life?

216
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,320
Help me, please.

217
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,159
Don't give up yet, Tul.

218
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,960
Please.

219
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Please.

220
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,559
Fine.

221
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,240
What do you need me to do this time?

222
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,919
I have a mole on the inside.

223
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,159
I was recently informed
that CJ is committing fraud.

224
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,600
But that person needs more time
to gather evidence.

225
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,399
Meanwhile, I need you
to distract her

226
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,080
from this investigation.

227
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,320
Distract her? How?

228
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,039
Distract her with her daughter.

229
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,960
I thought I found Irene
the best assistant.

230
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,200
But I was wrong.

231
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,440
You're no good.

232
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,919
I didn't think

233
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,799
you would have
the guts to show up here.

234
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,960
- You told me to come.
- Yes, I did.

235
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,600
But if I were you,

236
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,440
I would be too ashamed to show up.

237
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,399
Go away.

238
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,919
Don't show your face again.

239
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,399
You are fired.

240
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,480
CJ, hear me out.

241
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,840
- I can explain.
- Get out!

242
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,720
- I can explain.
- Get out!

243
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,600
I've been busy with the deal abroad,
and I'm so close.

244
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
I'll be able to close the deal
during our next meeting.

245
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,919
Irene will receive
full credit for this deal,

246
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,919
and it will cover up her scandals.

247
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,519
As for her girlfriend,

248
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,039
I've figured out a way
to get rid of her.

249
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,519
Look.

250
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,440
As for Irene's lesbian girlfriend,

251
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,599
you told me

252
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,519
she's trying to buy the property
where her father's bar is.

253
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,200
Convince CJ
to buy the property first.

254
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,279
Do it while Irene is abroad
so she won't be in your way.

255
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Irene.

256
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,359
Are you and Night fighting?

257
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,000
Why does Night look
oddly down today?

258
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,720
Well, I had a problem at work.

259
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,480
Night found out and got worried.

260
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,119
Aunt Jo, you should know
she gets anxious easily.

261
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,839
What should we do?

262
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,759
How about this?
You take Night somewhere relaxing.

263
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,200
I'll take care of the bar.
It's not that busy today.

264
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
That sounds good.

265
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,240
She needs a break.

266
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,410
I'm sorry for causing you
trouble again.

267
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,680
You're not. Take her.

268
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,890
Am I good at massage?

269
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,279
Yes.

270
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,720
You are great.

271
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,920
You should open a massage parlor.

272
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,839
If I was good at massage,
you wouldn't still be stressed.

273
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,839
I'm not stressed anymore. I'm fine.

274
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,960
That's good to hear. Otherwise,
you would make Aunt Jo worry.

275
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,839
See?

276
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,650
I'm smiling.

277
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,680
The stress is gone.

278
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,680
Don't lie to me.

279
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,000
It's fine. I have a way
to relieve your stress.

280
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,519
How?

281
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,170
A sexy outfit.

282
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,799
What? Don't you think
it's too revealing?

283
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,759
No, it's sexy.

284
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,079
Otherwise, I wouldn't call it sexy.

285
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,200
Are you really going to wear this?

286
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,519
Yes, but this one is for you.

287
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,799
- No.
- Night.

288
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,079
- No.
- Wear it. I'll put it on you.

289
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,839
- No.
- Night.

290
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,559
- I'll put it on you.
- No.

291
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,359
- Please. Wear it.
- No.

292
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
No, it's too revealing.

293
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,839
Night.

294
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,920
- No.
- It will relieve your stress.

295
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,559
- No.
- Come on.

296
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,799
- Irene, no, I don't want to.
- Night.

297
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,720
Wow.

298
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,359
You look adorable.

299
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,440
Wow, you look so cute in it,
you know that?

300
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,440
Let's take a selfie.

301
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,650
We're wearing
matching outfits after all.

302
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,839
- Smile.
- I am.

303
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
Night.

304
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
What?

305
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,519
Despite what problems come your way,

306
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,890
I promise to stand by you
until the end.

307
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,680
Thank you for standing by me,

308
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,680
Irene.

309
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,559
Anyway,

310
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,960
since we both are wearing
a sexy outfit,

311
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,759
I guess we won't be

312
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,960
sleeping much

313
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,279
tonight.

314
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
What?

315
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
What are you doing?

316
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,759
Irene.

317
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
- What are you doing?
- What?

318
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,359
Stop.

319
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,599
Stop.

320
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,200
I refuse to work with Tul.

321
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,599
I don't trust him.

322
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,440
You have to fire him.

323
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,599
You can't tell me what to do.

324
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,559
You have to do as I say.

325
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,200
You're the one who can't tell me
what to do. I'm not a kid anymore.

326
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,920
I get to do what I want.

327
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,000
Not a kid anymore?
Are you sure about that?

328
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,559
If that was true,

329
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:55,759
then how come I still have
to clean up after you

330
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,440
while you continue to embarrass me?

331
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,079
I didn't do anything.
Other people won't leave me alone.

332
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,559
They gossip about me.

333
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,599
And if you are so embarrassed by me,

334
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,240
I will leave.
I don't want to be here either.

335
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Irene.

336
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,759
I'll let you date
that bartender girl.

337
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
I won't stop you.

338
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,000
You just have to do
something for me.

339
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,559
If you want to know
what you have to do,

340
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,200
come back and we'll talk.

341
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,160
Let Tul in.

342
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,640
Tul made a deal
with a foreign client for you.

343
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,519
In two weeks, you'll need to
fly overseas to close the deal.

344
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,680
If you can pull it off,

345
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,680
everyone will
forget about your scandals,

346
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,319
and the other executives
will start to respect you too.

347
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,319
More importantly,

348
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,000
you can get back at Faye
for gossiping about you.

349
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,720
Working with Tul?

350
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,160
I told you I don’t trust him.

351
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,880
Honestly,

352
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,079
why do you trust him so much?

353
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,119
It might even have been him
who blabbed about me.

354
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
I didn't.

355
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,680
Please don't misunderstand.

356
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,519
Do you think I'm that stupid?

357
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,519
I've been working since forever.

358
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,960
You think I can't read people?

359
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,319
Irene, save your rant.

360
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,640
Just answer me.

361
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,279
Are you going to do it or not?

362
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Aunt Jo,

363
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,200
are you afraid of ghosts?

364
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,240
Absolutely not. Try me.

365
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,640
If it was a male ghost,
I'd make him my husband.

366
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,039
And what if the ghost was female?

367
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,319
I'd ask her for
the winning lottery number.

368
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,079
Why do you ask?

369
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,880
The thing is,

370
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,599
Night wants to
stay over at my place.

371
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,039
But she's worried
you can't be home alone.

372
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,119
Hold on.

373
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
I haven't even said I'm going.

374
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,240
Don't assume things.

375
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,480
Go on. Just go.

376
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,519
I'll manage on my own. Don't worry.

377
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,839
Aunt Jo!

378
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Oh? Is your mother okay with this?

379
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,000
I struck a secret deal with her,
so she gave in.

380
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,440
A secret deal?

381
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,599
What's this secret deal?

382
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,119
I'm not telling. It's a secret.

383
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,279
Hold it.

384
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,799
Come and talk
to me first, both of you.

385
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,599
Hi, Mother.

386
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Let me tell you both something.

387
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,599
If you want to be together,

388
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,519
you should support each other.

389
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,920
You can't just party all night
and let it affect your work.

390
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,160
I didn't go out tonight, Mom.

391
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,319
- I was helping her at the bar.
- Of course.

392
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,000
You don't seem this determined
working at the company.

393
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,240
And I'm very curious.

394
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,319
What kind of a relationship is it
between two women?

395
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,079
A relationship between two women

396
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,599
is basically the same
as a heterosexual relationship.

397
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,240
There's no difference.

398
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,119
And it's going to survive, right?

399
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,799
And what about you and Dad?
You're straight. Did it survive?

400
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,039
Irene.

401
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,319
You should stay out of this, Mom.

402
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,319
Love isn't dependent on gender.

403
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,920
And what about the future?

404
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,359
You can't conceive a child together.

405
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,279
Who's going to look after you then?

406
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,559
Is that why you had me?

407
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,759
Just so I could take care of you
when you become old?

408
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,240
Maybe you shouldn't have had me.

409
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,359
Irene.

410
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,759
Can you stop using that tone
with me? I asked you nicely.

411
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,039
And is your girlfriend mute?

412
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,960
She didn't answer
any of my questions.

413
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,160
Uh, well...

414
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,960
- I...
- Come on, Night.

415
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,799
Let's go up to my bedroom.

416
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,359
Go on.

417
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,240
You better enjoy it while it lasts.

418
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,920
Hello, Irene.

419
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,640
Are you on the plane yet?

420
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,400
Soon. I'm just waiting for them
to start boarding.

421
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,039
How are you doing?
Are you done shopping?

422
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:48,920
All done.

423
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,960
I'm at the bar now.

424
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm sorry I can't see you off.

425
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,519
Everyone took the day off today.

426
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,960
It's just me and Aunt Jo here,
so it's a little chaotic.

427
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,359
No worries.

428
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,039
You should get back to work then.

429
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,599
I have to get on the plane now.

430
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,119
I love you.

431
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,160
You'll be the first person I call
after I land.

432
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,119
Mm.

433
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,119
- Safe travels.
- Thanks.

434
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,359
How are you doing?

435
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,759
I hope you're not here
to demand payment

436
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,359
because I haven't missed
a single month of rent.

437
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,599
Oh? Tell us why you're here.

438
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,920
I managed to sell the land.

439
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,440
The new owner is asking you
to move out within three days.

440
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,200
What? You can't do that.

441
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,920
It's illegal.

442
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,799
I know. But have some sympathy.

443
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,640
Just hurry up and move out,
so there won't be a problem.

444
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,519
Ugh.

445
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,799
Who's this new owner?
Why are they so heartless?

446
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,279
Well...

447
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,880
That would be me.

448
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,839
Mother.

449
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,880
I knew you'd give in and fail.

450
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,680
That's why I decided
to come in person.

451
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,920
- So you bought the land, Mother?
- I'm your mother.

452
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,400
Stop acting as if we're close.

453
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,599
Is it going
to hurt you to be polite?

454
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,599
You can't treat people like dirt
just because you're rich.

455
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,400
So?

456
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,599
I don't want to be polite.

457
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,599
Do you have a problem with that?

458
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,039
Aunt Jo, calm down.

459
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,720
Let's not start a fight here.

460
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,359
CJ,

461
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,839
- about the move...
- Three days.

462
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,079
That's all I'm giving you.

463
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,480
Hurry up and move out.

464
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,680
I'm going to the police.
I have a written agreement.

465
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,079
You can't just spring this on us.
It's against the law.

466
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,480
Look at me carefully.

467
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,480
Do you think someone like me

468
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,599
is afraid of the law?

469
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,599
The law can't do anything to me.

470
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,559
Everything in this country
can be bought with money.

471
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,880
What a waste of time.

472
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,119
And pay back the money

473
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,079
you borrowed from my daughter.

474
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,720
The full amount, including interest.

475
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,200
I know what you hope
to gain from Irene.

476
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,480
CJ,

477
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,880
we never thought of cheating her.

478
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
We came up with a written agreement.

479
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,519
Is that so? Then pay her back
as soon as possible.

480
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,160
Do you even have it?

481
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,599
If you don't have the money,

482
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,440
then don't act
all high and mighty with me.

483
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,239
Night,

484
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
we don't have to open.

485
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,679
It's fine if we're closed for a day

486
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,289
since we're going to have
to close down anyway.

487
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,360
I don't understand.

488
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:49,360
Why did CJ allow me to stay
the night at her house?

489
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,119
She probably wanted to trick Irene
into thinking it's okay.

490
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,960
Then she came to deal with you
while Irene's away.

491
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,039
It's okay, Aunt Jo.

492
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,329
We'll find a new place

493
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,809
and the money to start over.

494
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:27,840
I invested so much in this place.

495
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,599
I still haven't gotten
my investment back,

496
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:34,679
and there are still
debts to pay off.

497
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,769
It's over.

498
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,199
I don't think we'll have

499
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,679
another shot at running a bar
in this lifetime, Night.

500
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,199
I'm sorry, Aunt Jo.

501
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,119
This is all my fault.

502
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,599
I shouldn't have gotten
acquainted with Irene.

503
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,079
If I had turned her down
right from the start,

504
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,480
things wouldn't have
ended up like this.

505
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,599
Don't blame yourself.
It's not like that.

506
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:14,719
It's my fault, Aunt Jo.

507
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,920
I'm the one who always
manages to wrong you.

508
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,519
Don't say that.

509
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,329
It's okay.

510
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,289
I can go back to performing.

511
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,480
Someone from the old days might take
mercy on an old trans lady like me.

512
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,329
Then I'll try to pay off our debts

513
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,000
and find a way to open a bar again.

514
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,559
And I'll get a job to earn money

515
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,679
to help you open a new bar.

516
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,289
I promise.

517
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,769
Irene's calling.

518
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:16,519
Don't answer it.

519
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,329
She's called me
at least ten times today.

520
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,809
But I don't want to answer.

521
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,289
Would she worry even more
if you don't answer?

522
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,920
What if she flies back impulsively?
It's going to affect her job.

523
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:44,480
Night, I tried calling a bunch
of times, but you never answered.

524
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,639
Is something wrong?

525
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,400
We were really busy here.

526
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,400
I'm sorry for worrying you.

527
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
That's a relief.

528
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
And what are you doing right now?

529
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,920
Uh, I have to go.

530
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,809
Another customer just walked in.

531
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:07,360
Okay. I miss you.

532
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:10,199
Mm. I miss you too.

533
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,559
Take all of these chairs.

534
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,079
Hey! What on earth are you doing?

535
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,679
Get out! Stop!

536
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,920
Hey! Stop right there!

537
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,440
Get out of my bar at once!

538
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,400
I'm trying to move the stuff out.
Out of the way, uncle!

539
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,840
Uncle my butt! I'm your aunt!

540
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,360
Whatever!

541
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,519
CJ said you are forbidden
from coming into the bar again.

542
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,880
And once we're done,

543
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,039
you can find someone
to collect your stuff.

544
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,199
What right do you have
to move my stuff out?

545
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:20,679
This is my bar!

546
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,809
All of the expensive
furnishings are damaged now!

547
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,400
- Get out!
- Hey!

548
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,039
No! Get out!

549
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,079
Leave, you punk!

550
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:33,440
Aunt Jo.

551
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,119
Get out! Leave!

552
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,769
It's you who has to leave, ladyboy!

553
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,239
Hey, what are you doing?

554
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,480
Aunt Jo, what's going on?

555
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,239
Who are these people?

556
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,329
CJ told these goons
to move our things out.

557
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,809
She has forbidden us
from setting foot in here again.

558
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,840
Hey! Go and cry somewhere else.

559
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,079
You're in the way.
I'm trying to do my job here.

560
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,639
Would it kill you to be polite?

561
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,239
Leave! Get out!

562
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,079
Aunt Jo,

563
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,599
I'm going to the police.

564
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,239
Hey, keep going! Ignore them!

565
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,719
Come on!

566
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,039
Move everything out.

567
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,639
There's no use going to the police.

568
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,199
CJ already told us
how influential she is.

569
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,920
It's okay.

570
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:03,039
Huh? What's going on here?

571
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:04,880
What happened?

572
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,519
Night!

573
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,400
Aunt Joanne!

574
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:12,880
Is anyone here?

575
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,119
Pull over here, please.

576
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,840
Thank you.

577
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,440
Night? Can you open the door for me?

578
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,480
Night? Is anyone here?

579
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:57,079
Mom's behind this for sure.

580
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,960
Irene,

581
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,360
you're back.

582
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,199
Thanks very much, Tul.

583
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,000
I made the right choice in
appointing you as Irene's assistant.

584
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,000
It was nothing.

585
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,519
It was your doing, wasn't it?

586
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,159
It was your doing.

587
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,880
You flew overseas
and closed the deal yourself.

588
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,519
There's no need to give me credit.

589
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,769
I meant Joanne Bar.
That was your doing, wasn't it?

590
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,840
Yes. That was me.

591
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:12,360
What did you do?

592
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,769
Where are Night and Aunt Joanne?

593
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:20,039
You evicted them, didn't you?

594
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,239
What if I did?
What are you going to do?

595
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,519
Why did you do it?

596
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Because I want you
to break up with her!

597
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,920
I don't want anyone to accuse me

598
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,440
of raising my daughter
to be a sexual deviant!

599
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,760
A sexual deviant?

600
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,719
That's right! I'm a sexual deviant!

601
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,320
So why won't you leave me alone?

602
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,400
Being "different" isn't "abnormal".

603
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,320
To devalue someone
is the same as devaluing yourself.

604
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,199
Our love is impossible, Irene.

605
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,119
Everything's over.

606
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,239
It's my fault
for falling in love with you.

607
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,880
Do you remember how you felt

608
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
when you were pregnant with Irene?

609
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,719
She's just a woman
who happens to love women.

610
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,679
Is that enough of a reason
for you to hate her?

611
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,360
Night?

612
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,679
What's going on?

613
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:47,920
Night ran away.

614
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:53,599
I'm here to discuss our children.

615
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:55,559
- It's too revealing.
- Night.

616
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:57,679
Cut!

617
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:00,039
Just go ahead. Embrace me.

618
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:02,000
It's already come to this.

619
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,199
Cut!

620
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,599
Hello! Hello!

621
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,199
I'll try again. It's okay.
