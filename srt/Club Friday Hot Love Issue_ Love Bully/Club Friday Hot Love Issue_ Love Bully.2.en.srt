1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,919
(Presents)

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,609
(Hot Love Issue)

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,000
What's your name?

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,480
- Night.
- Is it your birthday today?

11
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,960
Happy birthday, Night.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,320
You are acting like we've been
close friends for a long time.

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,559
Thirty minutes

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,320
is considered a long time.
Some people start dating by then.

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,530
So that's Irene's friend?
The bar girl?

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,119
Someone of her status

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,679
isn't suitable to be friends with
a future executive like my daughter.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,840
There's another truth about me.

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,920
You might be able to move on
from me more easily if you know.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,840
My father is a ladyboy.

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,200
Aunt Joanne

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,880
isn't my aunt.

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,200
She is my father.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,769
My father is a ladyboy.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,599
Do you feel disgusted
now that you know?

26
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,359
Night, what did you just tell her?

27
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,359
Dad.

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,159
Don't listen to her.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,359
She's talking nonsense.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,239
It's the truth.

31
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,680
Aunt Jo is my father.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
When I was young,

33
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,439
my friends made fun of that fact.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,439
It left a scar on my heart.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,319
I was bullied.
No one would be my friend.

36
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,400
My ex

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,319
was too embarrassed to be with me.

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,159
Eventually, he broke up with me.

39
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,400
I hid it within myself.

40
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,120
I never opened myself
to anyone again.

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Night.

42
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,090
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,240
Don't apologize, Aunt Jo.

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,159
It's not your fault.

45
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,599
You deserve to know though,

46
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,120
as it might change
your mind about me.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
Are you really her father?

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,759
Yes, he is.

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,879
He's my father.

50
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,919
Night has been bullied

51
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,960
because of this all her life,

52
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,680
so I told her to
call me aunt instead.

53
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,800
Aunt Jo, oh my gosh.
Daddy, I love you so much.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,680
I'm so glad to hear
that you are her father.

55
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,800
This means I'll have another father

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,360
if the law allows Night and me

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,319
to get married.

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,840
Oh my gosh. It'd be great
to have another father.

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,680
I'm so happy.
I would love to have you

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,759
as my father.

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Oh my gosh, Daddy.

62
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,639
How can you call me Daddy
when I have boobs and long hair?

63
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,439
How should I address you then?

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,759
Just call me Aunt Jo.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,280
All right then.

66
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,120
Please accept me as your daughter.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,680
Only if you promise
not to call me Daddy.

68
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,719
You got it. Can you tell me stories
about yourself? I'm dying to hear.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,519
Let's go talk over there. Come on.

70
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,279
So what happened?
Tell me your stories.

71
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,879
When I was a teenager, I was so hot.

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,680
I got to marry
the most popular girl in school.

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,120
Your life could be made
into a movie.

74
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,480
I agree. A few years
into the marriage,

75
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,480
I realized I would rather have
a husband than a wife.

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,730
Aunt Jo!

77
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,120
I've always visited that place.

78
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,319
You have an enviable life, Aunt Jo.
I like it.

79
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,120
I'm not giving up so easily, Night.

80
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,759
I'll do whatever it takes
for you to be my girlfriend.

81
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,160
You're still up?

82
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,399
The sun is about to rise.

83
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,199
I've been thinking about stuff.

84
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,079
Is Irene among the topics
you've been thinking about?

85
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,759
Yes.

86
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,800
I knew she was stubborn,

87
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,240
but not this stubborn.

88
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,319
I told her that
we shouldn't meet again

89
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,560
and that she should forget about me,

90
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,279
but she wouldn't listen.

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,399
You told her to forget you.

92
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,800
What about you though?
Can you really forget her?

93
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,680
What are you talking about?
We are not dating.

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,800
We are just acquaintances.

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,959
We will eventually forget
about one another.

96
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
I know

97
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,279
that you've been bullied
and falsely accused

98
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,839
all your life.

99
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,720
However,

100
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,199
I want you
to ask yourself carefully.

101
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,439
Will you regret losing
a good person like Irene

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,560
because you care too much
about what other people say?

103
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,439
It's her mother
we are talking about.

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
Listen to me.

105
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,959
Don't include anyone else
in the equation.

106
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,879
Just focus on yourself and Irene.

107
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Ask yourself how you feel about her.

108
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
She's weird.

109
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,279
She's strange.

110
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,279
But I think it's cute.

111
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,480
The world looks much brighter
with her around.

112
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,160
I don't think I will ever meet
anyone like her again.

113
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,199
It would break my heart

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,199
if we stopped seeing each other.

115
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,759
When you love somebody,

116
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,439
you love them for who they are.

117
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,879
You love their uniqueness

118
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,160
and the fact that
they are irreplaceable.

119
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,680
Someone once said

120
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,680
that you love people who won't
circle back into your life.

121
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
Irene is this person for you.

122
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
- But...
- No buts.

123
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,480
I know that you get anxious.

124
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,040
But this is very important.

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,040
Take your time
to think things through

126
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,279
so you won't regret it later.

127
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,279
Do you think
our relationship will last

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,159
if we start dating?

129
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,000
As long as you love
and hold onto each other tightly,

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,120
no obstacles can pull you apart.

131
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm going to bed.

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,639
I'll let you think things over.

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
Get some sleep.

134
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,639
Aunt Jo.

135
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Listen.

136
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,840
I might not have an answer
for my love life right now.

137
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,840
But for us,

138
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,480
I can't believe that
the unresolved issues

139
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,240
in my heart,

140
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,559
which have given me a complex,

141
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,960
could be unlocked just by having

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,279
the person I love understand me.

143
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,840
Seeing Irene's reaction today

144
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,480
made me realize

145
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,840
that I had been overreacting
for no reason.

146
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,210
The two of us
just have different lives

147
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,039
than other people.

148
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,879
Night.

149
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,919
I'm sorry I'm like this.

150
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,159
I love you.

151
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,330
Dad.

152
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,879
Stop apologizing to me.

153
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,039
I'm honored and proud

154
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,240
to be your daughter.

155
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,480
Night.

156
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,330
No matter what people say,

157
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,200
I want you to know

158
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,759
that you were born from love.

159
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,840
You weren't an accident.

160
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,399
When you said

161
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,320
having the person you love
understand you

162
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
unlocked your feelings,

163
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,679
were you referring to Irene?

164
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Dad.

165
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,399
I'm getting sleepy.

166
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,559
You should sleep too.

167
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,879
Go already, Dad.

168
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,000
Hello.

169
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,559
Irene.

170
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,799
I'm sorry for calling you
this early in the morning.

171
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,080
It's okay.

172
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,159
Is everything all right?

173
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,559
Yes, everything's fine.

174
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,320
I'm just calling to say

175
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
that my answer is yes.

176
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,080
What do you mean?

177
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,440
Well, you asked me a question

178
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,279
last night.

179
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,200
- Last night?
- Yes.

180
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,080
Wait. Are you saying
you will be my girlfriend?

181
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,559
Yes.

182
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Do you mean it?

183
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,440
I have a girlfriend!

184
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Hey, keep your voice down.

185
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Don't scare your mother
screaming like that.

186
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,720
She might think you're hurt.

187
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,440
Thank you so much, my girlfriend.

188
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Sure.

189
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,639
Darling.

190
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,039
Irene, let go. I'm ticklish.

191
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
No.

192
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,120
You're my darling.

193
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,480
I want to hug and kiss you all day.

194
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,799
What, darling? Let go.
You're tickling me.

195
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Come here.

196
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,519
What's wrong?

197
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,559
You are my darling.

198
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,559
Do you not like to be called that?

199
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,799
What should I call you then?

200
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,080
Babe? Baby?

201
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,440
Or honey?

202
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,559
No.

203
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,879
Just call me by my name.

204
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm too shy.

205
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,519
Fine, I'll call you by your name.

206
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
Do you remember when I said

207
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,679
I would make you
the happiest woman on earth?

208
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Yes.

209
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
I will

210
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,879
get started then.

211
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,399
Irene.

212
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
What's wrong?

213
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,360
I...

214
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,919
I need to help
Aunt Jo buy supplies for the bar.

215
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,960
I asked Aunt Jo if we could
spend the afternoon together.

216
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,410
She gave us her permission.

217
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,200
She said she can go alone.

218
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,720
You're so stubborn.

219
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,650
You always get your way, don't you?

220
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,170
You know the answer.

221
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,240
So don't fight me.

222
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,170
Fine.

223
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,359
I'll stop.

224
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,650
You can do whatever you want.

225
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,170
You can't take it back.

226
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,799
I won't.

227
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,279
Hey.

228
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,890
Do you want to do it again?

229
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,920
Don't be silly.

230
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,319
I have to go.

231
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,279
I need to open the bar.

232
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Fine.

233
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,319
I actually have to go too.

234
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,039
My mother wants me
to have dinner with someone.

235
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,759
I want to help you out
at the bar though.

236
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,079
You should go.

237
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,200
Be nice to your mother.

238
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't misbehave,

239
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,079
all right?

240
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,319
Fine.

241
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,680
Since you are my girlfriend,

242
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,079
I will listen to everything you say.

243
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,759
You're the best.

244
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,650
It's time to get up.

245
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,599
Come on.

246
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,960
No.

247
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,200
Get up or we'll be late.

248
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,359
Irene.

249
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,559
Let's do it again.

250
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,759
Stop.

251
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,839
Stop smiling, Ms. Bartender.

252
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,599
What? I'm not smiling.

253
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,079
Whatever. You've been smiling
from ear to ear.

254
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,519
Aunt Jo.

255
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,650
I'm going out for a smoke.
I'll be right back.

256
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,170
Take your time.

257
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,480
Stop smiling.

258
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,410
Stop it.

259
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,410
Gosh.

260
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,039
You jerk.

261
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,599
- What's going on?
- You douchebag.

262
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,559
You scumbag.

263
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,079
What are you doing here?

264
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,440
Go away.

265
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,960
Aunt Jo, I mean no harm.

266
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,279
I don't care.

267
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,960
Get lost now.

268
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,440
Will you leave voluntarily? Or do I
get someone to drag you out?

269
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,480
Aunt Jo, I'm here to apologize.
I feel guilty.

270
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,799
I want to apologize
to you and Night.

271
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,720
Leave now or you'll be
leaving in an ambulance.

272
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,279
Aunt Jo, I'm sorry.

273
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,890
- Aunt Jo.
- Leave now!

274
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,599
Or I'll call an ambulance
to escort you out.

275
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,359
Get lost.

276
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,799
- Get lost.
- Aunt Jo.

277
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,319
I won't let you hurt
my daughter again,

278
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,119
you jerk.

279
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,839
What's so funny?

280
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
It's funny.

281
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,650
You're such an idiot.

282
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,650
How am I an idiot?

283
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,480
I followed your orders.

284
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,960
I approached Night
and persuaded her to leave Irene.

285
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,440
Why would you do that?

286
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,079
I'm trying to get on CJ's good side.

287
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,200
If I can break those two apart,

288
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,720
CJ will trust me more.

289
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,170
That's why I called you an idiot.

290
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,519
What about you? Are you so smart?

291
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,559
I don't know,

292
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,799
but I'm not short-sighted like you.

293
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,400
Answer me.
Why would you break them apart

294
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,200
when you're supposed
to keep them together?

295
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,319
Why would I keep them together?

296
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,920
You said it yourself
that they are weirdly close.

297
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,200
You know, a little bird told me
that Irene is a lesbian.

298
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,279
She dated an Asian girl in L.A.

299
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,519
They broke up a few months ago.

300
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,359
I think

301
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,440
those two are
more than close friends.

302
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,279
No way.

303
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,960
Night doesn't like girls.

304
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,240
You don't know that.

305
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,799
Her ex-boyfriend
might have been such a jerk

306
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,279
that she changed her preference.

307
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,680
If you don't stop
insulting me, I'm leaving.

308
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,359
Leave then. I was going to share
a very good plan with you.

309
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,519
I lowered myself to sleep with you,
thinking you would be smarter.

310
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,359
In the end, I have
to teach you everything.

311
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,880
Tell me about your plan.

312
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,440
Are you a good liar?

313
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,000
Not as good as you are.

314
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,519
Get better then.

315
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,720
Tell different lies

316
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,640
to Irene and her mother.

317
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,400
Manipulate and provoke them.

318
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,240
Can you do that much?

319
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,039
If not, just leave.

320
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,880
I don't talk to idiots.

321
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,319
So? How’s this for a change?

322
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,240
What do you think? I’m worried
Aunt Jo might walk in on us.

323
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,240
She won’t.

324
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,079
I told her to give us
some romantic time.

325
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,240
Why did you say that?
She’ll realize what we’re up to.

326
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
I don’t see how that’s a problem.

327
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,519
We’re adults. It's only natural.
She’ll understand.

328
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,880
Get out.

329
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,960
What? Are you mad at me?

330
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,319
I’m not.

331
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,119
I’m just worried.

332
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
Besides,

333
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,799
it’s your first day
at work tomorrow.

334
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,519
You should go home and rest.

335
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,880
I hate talking about work.

336
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,480
Can I stay at your place tonight?

337
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,799
It will motivate me.

338
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,960
No, your mom might
suspect something.

339
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,279
She won’t.

340
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,039
I’ve been going home late recently,
and she hasn’t said anything.

341
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,079
Besides, she’s stopped
asking about you.

342
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,079
- Really?
- Mm.

343
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,680
Maybe she realized
she was in the wrong.

344
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,160
That’s why she hasn’t stopped me.

345
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,880
I’m still suspicious about Irene.

346
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,559
Are you sure she’s not in touch
with that bargirl friend anymore?

347
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,640
Most definitely. I’ve been
keeping an eye on her.

348
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,160
Where has Irene been off
to almost every night then?

349
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,480
She doesn’t have any friends here.

350
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
She likes going out alone.

351
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,559
She even goes out
and drinks by herself sometimes.

352
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,480
I think

353
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:03,960
living overseas for so long made her
comfortable with being alone.

354
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,079
Good.

355
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,759
I can rest assured somewhat

356
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,240
if she’s been behaving.

357
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,200
Anyway,

358
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,880
has she arrived?
I can introduce you to her.

359
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,519
Your secretary has
escorted her upstairs.

360
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,559
But she’s gone down for coffee.

361
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,839
Let me know
if she comes back upstairs.

362
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,640
Yes, ma’am.

363
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,920
Here’s your "food support".

364
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,839
Here’s your drink

365
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,039
so you’ll feel refreshed
while you work.

366
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,839
Thanks.

367
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,119
Aren’t you going to sit down
and chat? Ten minutes is fine.

368
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,799
I’d rather not.
Someone might see us.

369
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,559
What’s there to be scared of?
My mom’s okay with it now.

370
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,960
Maybe you could...

371
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,039
come upstairs
and introduce yourself to her?

372
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,599
So we won’t have
to hide it any longer.

373
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,880
I’ll pass. Maybe next time.

374
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,039
It’s your first day on the job.

375
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,400
Work hard, okay?

376
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,359
Okay. I’d better
get back to it then.

377
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,799
- Mm.
- Drive safely, okay?

378
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Okay. Bye.

379
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,319
Wait. Can I have some moral support?

380
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,160
Irene.

381
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,319
Right here?

382
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,359
Come on. Hurry up,
or someone might see us.

383
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,759
Bye.

384
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
I want to have a word with you.

385
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,319
Please have a seat.

386
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,519
This is Tul, your assistant.

387
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,599
Hello, Irene.

388
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,039
Hello.

389
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,240
Tul’s going to help you with work.

390
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,759
He's the best assistant
I could find right now.

391
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,559
You can learn the ropes from him.

392
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,200
You can count on me, Irene.

393
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,519
I’m available for you
24 hours a day.

394
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,079
Great. There’s someone
who can join me for drinks.

395
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,160
Irene,

396
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,519
can you behave appropriately
as a future executive?

397
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,920
As you wish, ma’am.

398
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,960
Faye and the team are ready
and waiting in the meeting room, CJ.

399
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Good.

400
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,640
Come, Irene.

401
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,200
It’s time to work.

402
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,839
The person I'm taking you to meet
is your competitor.

403
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,079
Do anything
in your power to defeat her.

404
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,960
Sway all the executives to side
with you, understand?

405
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,960
- Irene, I asked if you understand.
- Yes.

406
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,000
Don’t worry, ma’am.
I’ll help look after her.

407
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,240
Good.

408
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,039
Hello, CJ.

409
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,680
Hello, Faye.

410
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,319
It’s been a while.
I hope you’re doing well?

411
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,799
Yes, I am.

412
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,599
I thought she was the enemy?
What’s with the phoniness?

413
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,480
Hello, Irene.

414
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,720
It’s a shame we didn’t
get to talk at the party.

415
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,599
I was busy entertaining
the important guests.

416
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,559
Anyway, I have to thank you.

417
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,119
It would've been bad if you hadn't
helped me entertain the guests.

418
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,000
It was my pleasure.

419
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh, let’s consider this
an official introduction for Irene

420
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,559
so you can do business together.

421
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,160
If you have any problems
or questions,

422
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,000
you can always
discuss them with her.

423
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,599
She has a degree from overseas

424
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,319
and a large network.

425
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,599
She should be able to help expand
our international client base.

426
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,559
Of course, CJ.

427
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,440
But this must be your
first time working, Irene.

428
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,880
If you have any questions or want to
know anything, let me know.

429
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,240
I’m happy to help.

430
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,440
Oh, since you’re just starting out,

431
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,839
I’ve prepared some
information for you

432
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,160
so you can learn how
we do things here.

433
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
I’ve already emailed it to you.

434
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,640
That shouldn’t be necessary.

435
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,319
I've summed everything up
and emailed it to everyone.

436
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,240
Irene’s also done her homework
before starting today.

437
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,640
And we’ve had some preliminary
discussions with CJ.

438
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,279
Would anyone mind
if I give a verbal summary?

439
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,359
Thank you very much.

440
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,799
So here’s the summary for this week.

441
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,759
I’ll let you have this one
because I feel sorry for you.

442
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,359
That way, you can score some
brownie points with the old hag.

443
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,839
Cheers.

444
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
I don’t understand
Thai people at all.

445
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,920
They are so two-faced.

446
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,279
You can tell when
two people hate each other,

447
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,839
but they still put on a poker face.

448
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,319
Plus, they talk about it
behind each other's backs.

449
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,559
You’ll get used to it eventually.

450
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,400
No way.

451
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,639
I’ll never be like that.

452
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,769
Well, I don’t think

453
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,239
we have to be nice
to those phonies all the time.

454
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,289
That Faye could probably tell

455
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,639
and acted all "sae-sang" at you too.

456
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,639
- Night.
- Hm?

457
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,289
What does "sae-sang" mean?

458
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,480
In English, it means...

459
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,480
- fake.
- Ew!

460
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,400
I hate fake people.

461
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,679
I’ll give them a piece of my mind
if anyone acts like that around me.

462
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,400
But it's how you survive
in your professional circle.

463
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,000
There’s another Thai phrase.
It's a bit more positive.

464
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:00,769
It’s called "yuu-pen".

465
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,199
Being tactful is
the meaning of "yuu-pen".

466
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,599
That phrase again.

467
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,960
What are you exactly trying to say?

468
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,639
I’m talking about your girlfriend.

469
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,719
How do you know I have a girlfriend?

470
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,679
I know everything, Irene.

471
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,239
But don’t worry.
I won’t tell your mother.

472
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,440
You can go ahead
and be with your girlfriend.

473
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,039
But don’t say anything
to your mother just yet.

474
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,679
What do you mean by that?

475
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,000
I’m about to suggest
some ways for you to be tactful.

476
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,719
Just deliberately show her
you’ve been working hard.

477
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,559
I’ll always have your back.

478
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:51,400
Then, once she sees
you’re dedicated,

479
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,079
she’ll leave your girlfriend alone.

480
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,360
But she’ll find out
eventually anyway.

481
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,960
We’ll just have to keep it
a secret for as long as possible.

482
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:07,920
Once you’ve built a good
track record, use it as leverage.

483
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:15,639
Okay. That’s quite
an interesting idea.

484
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,960
Well then. We should
get to work right away.

485
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:27,920
Here’s the data
on our Chinese client base.

486
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,039
These are the numbers
for ownership transfers...

487
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,159
How is Irene doing?

488
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:35,159
We just discussed the plan
to open an international market.

489
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,239
She was very cooperative.

490
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,559
Is that true? How were you
able to pull that off?

491
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:44,039
It’s probably
because we’re similar in age.

492
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,599
That’s why we are
on the same wavelength.

493
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,039
I don’t think there’s anything
to worry about.

494
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,519
Irene’s been doing very well.

495
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,880
Good. Keep looking after her, Tul.

496
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,079
I have to go overseas
for a business trip this week.

497
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,199
Text me if there’s anything.

498
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,809
You know that, don’t you?

499
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,920
Of course. Don’t worry, ma’am.

500
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:24,769
Right, Irene.

501
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,960
Your mom’s flying
overseas tonight, isn’t she?

502
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,329
Irene?

503
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,519
Why do you look so stressed?

504
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,719
Is everything okay?

505
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,480
Do you remember Faye?

506
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:43,039
The woman my mom said was
my competitor.

507
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,719
Sure, I remember. Why?

508
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,559
Well, my assistant texted me.

509
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,960
She’s been deceiving
the executive board

510
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:58,039
into thinking that I did drugs
when I was in L.A.

511
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,239
So they’re worried
it might not look good

512
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:06,239
if they send me overseas
to do business.

513
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,809
There’s more, actually.

514
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,000
The country we’re currently
in negotiations with

515
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,809
is a conservative one.

516
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,239
They won’t accept the fact that...

517
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,639
I’m an executive
who’s dating a woman.

518
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:34,119
But no one knows about us.

519
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,559
So how did Faye find out?

520
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:38,639
I know, right?

521
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,239
I think she probably has
someone spying on me.

522
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,360
Take it easy, Irene.

523
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,400
Things might not be
as bad as we think.

524
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,639
I won’t take it easy, Night.

525
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,440
Irene? Hey, hold on.

526
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,159
Oh?

527
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,039
Irene?

528
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,440
How did Faye find out about me?

529
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,639
I think someone might’ve
seen you and told her.

530
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,960
You were the only person who knew.

531
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,400
Maybe you told her about me?

532
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,809
I didn’t. Why would I do that?
I’m on your side.

533
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,639
Forget it. I don’t care
what people say.

534
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,639
Morning, Irene.

535
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,239
You really enjoy talking about me
behind my back, don’t you?

536
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,880
What are you talking about?

537
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,360
To bullshit is "tor-lae"
in Thai, isn’t it?

538
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,079
Please mind your tone.
What have I ever done to you?

539
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,559
Irene, what are you doing?
I’m not a lesbian like you.

540
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:12,440
See? I haven’t even said anything.

541
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,289
You blurted it out yourself.

542
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,039
I know you’re
the double-crossing kind.

543
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:24,400
Just admit you have feelings for me.

544
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,719
I don’t.

545
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:28,960
Stop it. Someone might see us.

546
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,769
Don’t worry. I locked the door.

547
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:36,920
Irene, let go of me!

548
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,769
Just admit you have feelings for me.

549
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,769
Irene, let go of me!

550
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,719
Let go!

551
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,719
Irene, stop!

552
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,809
Don’t!

553
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,000
Let go!

554
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,599
It’s only a warning this time.

555
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:09,329
Don’t talk about me
behind my back again.

556
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,809
It's my business and not yours.

557
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:13,769
Don’t be nosy.

558
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:16,920
It will be worse next time.

559
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,920
- Irene?
- Get out!

560
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,079
What happened?

561
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,360
Curious? Go in there and find out.

562
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Get out! I said get out!

563
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,239
Get out!

564
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:42,599
Hello, Night? Can you make me
a Cocktail Irene?

565
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,239
I feel like celebrating.

566
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,159
I’ll come over to see you now.

567
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,239
Irene, where are you going?

568
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,840
Tul, what should we do?
Faye is throwing a tantrum.

569
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,960
Find her something to cover up.
I’ll keep a lookout.

570
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,360
- Okay. Sure.
- Get out!

571
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,639
I said get out!

572
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:05,440
Get out!

573
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,800
Don’t assume others are "gullible".
You might be getting "used" as well.

574
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,719
This is Tul.
He’s the ex I told you about.

575
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,360
If you want to be together,
you should support each other.

576
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,639
You can't just party all night
and let it affect your work.

577
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,719
Come on, Night.

578
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,679
You better enjoy it while it lasts.

579
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,119
Tul’s arranged a meeting
with a client overseas for you.

580
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:12,199
You have to fly over
and close the deal.

581
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,760
I told you
I don’t trust people like him.

582
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,039
Honestly, why are you
so trusting of him?

583
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,079
Three days.
That's all I'm giving you.

584
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,719
Hurry up and move out.

585
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,480
Cut!

586
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,880
You liked it, didn't you?

587
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,599
It’s only a warning
for you this time.

588
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:34,480
It’ll be worse for you next time!

589
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,400
- I’m so sorry!
- It’s okay.

590
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,480
It wasn’t painful.

591
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,760
No obstacles can pull you apart.

592
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,719
Maybe let’s try again.

593
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,119
I'll let you think things over.

594
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,840
- Get some...
- Uh...

595
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,960
I looked into her eyes,
and my mind went blank.

596
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,280
Did she put a spell on me
or something?
