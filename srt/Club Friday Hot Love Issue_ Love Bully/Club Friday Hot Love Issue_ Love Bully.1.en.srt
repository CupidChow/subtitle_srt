1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,919
(Presents)

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,609
(Hot Love Issue)

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,560
Happy birthday, Night.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,439
Am I the first person
to wish you a happy birthday?

11
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,039
Of course.

12
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,320
You're the first

13
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,480
and probably the only person
who will call me.

14
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,799
You complain about being single,

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,239
but you won't find yourself a lover.

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,640
No, thanks.

17
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,719
I'm happy being with you, Aunt.

18
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,239
If I were to find a lover,

19
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,409
that person would have to love me

20
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,280
and you.

21
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,640
Stop it.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,400
I don't want to talk about it.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,359
I have to go. Happy birthday again.

24
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,480
Bye.

25
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,519
Bye.

26
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,879
Hey, you.

27
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,959
Make me a drink.

28
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,530
I'm sorry,

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,400
but we are closed.

30
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,719
What a shame.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,639
But I'm already here.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,599
Plus, I just got off a plane.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,680
A cold drink would be perfect.

34
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,879
Thailand is so hot.

35
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,159
Fix me a drink, will you?

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Please.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,530
Well...

38
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,719
What's your name?

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,439
Night.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,639
Please make me a drink, Night.

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Please.

42
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,919
I...

43
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,879
Why are you so slow?

44
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,719
Does this belong to someone?

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
If not, can I drink it?

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,120
Wait.

47
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,599
Hey.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Wow.

49
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,719
That's nice.

50
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,879
You are better

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,639
than the bartenders in L.A.

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,280
Thank you.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,199
But I'm not all that.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Hey.

55
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,840
Does this drink have a name?

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,840
So I know what to order next time.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,439
I'm inventing a new drink.

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,240
But you stole the drink
before I could taste it.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,919
So I don't know if it's good enough

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,159
to put on the menu.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
It's Irene.

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
What?

63
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,039
That's my name, Irene.

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,080
Since I'm the first person
to taste this drink,

65
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,360
you can name the drink after me.

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
I won't charge you.

67
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,639
Okay, sure.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Hey.

69
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,639
Wow.

70
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,610
Close the bar quickly and
come home to eat your birthday cake.

71
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,050
I...

72
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

73
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,079
What's the word?

74
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,759
S...

75
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,079
Snoop.

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Yes.

77
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,279
I didn't mean to look.

78
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,399
Is it your birthday today?

79
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,439
Yes.

80
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,959
Happy birthday, Night.

81
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,279
I don't have a gift for you,

82
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,050
so I'll give you a kiss instead.

83
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,680
Thanks.

84
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,680
You are quite a friendly person.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,519
Are you calling me nosy?

86
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,879
No.

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,610
Your Thai suddenly became so fluent.

88
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,199
I meant you are acting like

89
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,920
we've been close friends
for a long time.

90
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,480
We've known each other
for 30 minutes.

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,639
It's considered a long time.

92
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,160
Some people start dating by then.

93
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,000
Now that we're here,
can you make me another drink?

94
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,279
Let's celebrate your birthday.

95
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,279
Please.

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,879
- Fine.
- Wait.

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,720
A peck on the cheek and a kiss on
the hand are your birthday gifts

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,600
from me because you're too adorable.

99
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,800
Don't wipe it off.

100
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,920
It's my gift to you.

101
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,759
Okay.

102
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
You are clumsy, aren't you?

103
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,040
How cute.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,879
I don't know why I feel this tipsy.

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,120
It's probably because I haven't
eaten a meal since I landed.

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,199
I only had two drinks.

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,560
I see.

108
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,120
Are you sure you can
get home by yourself?

109
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,959
Certainly.

110
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,079
Here's my ride.

111
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
I'll help you.

112
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,360
I'll get going then.

113
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,759
Bye.

114
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,960
You smell nice.

115
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

116
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,639
Goodnight.

117
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,450
Bye.

118
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,330
Irene.

119
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,090
Listen.

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,000
I've decided to tag along with you.

121
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,840
I'll send you home.

122
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,559
Aoy and Chod,

123
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,159
it's funny how we always find love
when we don't want it.

124
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,519
In fact, this love
is not strange at all.

125
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,840
We are just two women
who happened to meet,

126
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
click,

127
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,679
and fall in love.

128
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,759
Why do Irene and I

129
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,450
have to face obstacles
and constantly prove ourselves

130
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,360
just because we're women?

131
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,279
Unlike typical relationships
between men and women,

132
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,330
where love alone is enough.

133
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,840
No one interferes like they do
in our relationship.

134
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,120
This world is so unfair,
Aoy and Chod.

135
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,919
Even if the whole world tries to
show open-mindedness and acceptance,

136
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,919
in the end, there are still people
who won't truly accept us.

137
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,600
Especially when this type
of relationship

138
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,480
involves their family members.

139
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,639
Hello.

140
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,039
Where are you now?
I'm waiting for you.

141
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm on my way, honey.

142
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,919
I'm not your honey.

143
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,919
We're just casually
sleeping together.

144
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,799
Don't call me that again.

145
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,320
I can be whatever you want me to be

146
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,759
as long as I get
to be close to you, Faye.

147
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,720
Where did you follow Irene to?
You came back so late.

148
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,120
To a bar.

149
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,159
She partied as soon as she landed.

150
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,360
You know what's funny?

151
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,960
The bar owner happens to be

152
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,080
my ex-girlfriend.

153
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Really?

154
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
I'm not surprised though.

155
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,399
You've dated a lot of women.

156
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,159
She's bound to run into one of them.

157
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,759
Have you thought
of using your ex-girlfriend?

158
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,679
I guess you ended things
on bad terms.

159
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,480
Come on, it's for
both of our benefits.

160
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,399
Can we stop talking?

161
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,600
There's something else
I'd rather do.

162
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,440
You're impatient
when it comes to this.

163
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,759
Irene.

164
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,799
Where were you last night?

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,960
Your flight landed at 11 p.m.

166
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,039
You should have arrived home
before 1 a.m.

167
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,840
You came home at dawn.
Where did you go?

168
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,120
Is this how you greet your daughter,
whom you haven't seen in a while?

169
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,440
Do you ever care about me?

170
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,600
"Are you jet-lagged?
Have you eaten?"

171
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,200
Do you know how to say those words?

172
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,960
You don't care

173
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,279
whether or not
I'm concerned about you.

174
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,600
You only care about money.

175
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,519
If you dragged me back
so we could fight,

176
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,240
I might as well go back to L.A.
It's annoying.

177
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,200
I dragged you back
so you could start working.

178
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,360
Stop being silly and
wasting my money away.

179
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,879
You're old enough to know better.

180
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,440
Aren't you afraid
I'll ruin your company?

181
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,080
You are a smart girl.

182
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,039
You always succeed
once you set your mind

183
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,679
on something.

184
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,720
But you just refuse to do so.

185
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,639
You know why I'm like that,
don't you?

186
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Because you have
your father's filthy blood.

187
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,159
Mom!

188
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,080
Don't talk about him like that.

189
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,759
He's a good man.

190
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,320
Is that so?

191
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,679
Do you call someone who abandoned
his wife and child a good man?

192
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,759
Irene.

193
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,200
Rumor has it you did drugs
when you were abroad.

194
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,480
It's true, isn't it?

195
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,399
Think what you want.

196
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,200
You won't believe anything
I say anyway

197
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,919
because, in your eyes,
I'm a horrible person.

198
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
Why didn't Dad take me with him?

199
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,799
Where's my bracelet?

200
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Thank you very much for your help.

201
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,320
You owe me six months' rent
totaling 180,000 baht,

202
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,679
not including this month's rent
of an additional 30,000 baht.

203
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,480
You have until the end of the month.

204
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,440
Otherwise, I'd have
to evict you, Jo.

205
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
All right.

206
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,399
We open at 5 p.m.

207
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
I see.

208
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,639
But...

209
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Are you here to see someone?

210
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm here to see Night.

211
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,759
Night.

212
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,519
Hey, Irene.
What brings you here at this hour?

213
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,399
Is everything all right?

214
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,399
I lost the bracelet
my father gave me.

215
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,799
I might have dropped it here.

216
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,200
I still had the bracelet
when I was here

217
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,039
last night.

218
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,360
Can you help me find it?

219
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,440
It's very important to me.

220
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,919
Do you want to try?

221
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,000
- Yes.
- Hold it like this.

222
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,039
That's right.

223
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,440
- Now...
- How much do I pour?

224
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,559
Pour.

225
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,440
Half a shot.

226
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,920
That's right. You're doing great.

227
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,890
Next, excuse me.

228
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,799
This one.

229
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,240
Move it up and down.

230
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,170
It should be around here if it fell
while we were making the cocktail.

231
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Ouch.

232
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,650
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

233
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,890
Let me blow on it.

234
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,960
That's what children do.

235
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,079
But

236
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
thanks though.

237
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm better now.

238
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,240
Irene.

239
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,839
Is this the one?

240
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,279
Yes, it is! Thank you!

241
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,200
I thought I had lost it.

242
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,799
Can you put it on me?

243
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,359
Sure.

244
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,319
Night.

245
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,279
Hey, Aunt Jo.

246
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,960
I need to buy something.

247
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,410
I'll come back when the bar opens.

248
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,240
This is Irene.

249
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,039
She's...

250
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,759
My name is Irene.

251
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,960
I stopped by the bar after
I got back from L.A. last night.

252
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,170
That's how we met.

253
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,650
I lived in L.A. for ten years,
so I don't have any Thai friends.

254
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,559
She's my only Thai friend right now.

255
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,119
Can I come by here often?

256
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,000
Of course.

257
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,000
You just came back from L.A., right?

258
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm looking for a foreign boyfriend.

259
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,519
Introduce me to
a handsome and muscular man.

260
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,720
Find me a man.

261
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,079
You got it.

262
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,480
What took you so long
to call me back?

263
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,000
I hired you to be Irene's assistant.

264
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,079
Can I really trust you?

265
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,410
I'm sorry, CJ.

266
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,119
I left my phone in the car.
I just went to get it.

267
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,119
Where was she last night?

268
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,279
A friend?

269
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,960
She doesn't have
any friends in Thailand.

270
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Well.

271
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,839
I don't know.

272
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,720
Find out who this person is

273
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,170
so we can look
into this person's background.

274
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,890
Listen.

275
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,799
Don't forget

276
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,890
that we must protect Irene's
reputation as much as possible.

277
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,720
Yes, CJ.

278
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,890
Faye is actively trying
to climb her way up.

279
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,599
If she hears about Irene's return,

280
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,410
she will definitely try
to sabotage Irene.

281
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,890
She's a devil.

282
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,279
She uses her body to gain benefits.

283
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,960
How dare she compete
against my daughter?

284
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,960
Keep dreaming.

285
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,170
You...

286
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,720
Don't worry, CJ.

287
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,759
I'll handle it.

288
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,599
Calm down, Faye.

289
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,680
Does that hag really think a spoiled
brat like Irene can beat me?

290
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,240
Don't stress over it.

291
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,480
Everyone knows that
the higher-ups adore you.

292
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,119
Irene can't beat you.

293
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,039
Don't worry.

294
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,880
- Night.
- Yes.

295
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,720
I flipped the open sign for you.

296
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,680
You are quite agile.

297
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,359
I thought you would be...

298
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
What?

299
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,359
"Stepping on chicken poop".

300
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,599
Ew, who would step on chick poop?

301
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
You lived in L.A. for ten years.

302
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,519
I guess you don't understand
Thai idioms.

303
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,079
In other words,

304
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm praising you
for being good on your feet.

305
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,680
I was a server in L.A.

306
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,680
I don't want to brag, but I used to
make hundreds of burgers a day.

307
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,720
That's called bragging.

308
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,039
Good for you.

309
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,119
I'm sleepy.

310
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,680
Are you jet-lagged?

311
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,839
Why don't you go home and sleep?

312
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,920
Can I take a nap here?

313
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,960
Do you want to do that?

314
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,079
All right then.

315
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,799
I'll take you to the roof.

316
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,279
- Amp.
- Yes?

317
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,799
- Are you doing the laundry?
- That's right.

318
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
Can you help me with this?

319
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,759
- Sure.
- Thanks.

320
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,200
All right. I'll take you
upstairs. Come with me.

321
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,039
Wow, I didn't know you had
a place like this on your rooftop.

322
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,559
I'd sleep here when I'm drunk
but don't feel like going home.

323
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,839
- Oh?
- Ah, so nice.

324
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,039
Hey.

325
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,319
Why don't you use the pillow?

326
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,359
No, I want to lie here.

327
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,559
I have to get back to work.

328
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,799
Well,

329
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,240
I want to talk
to you about something.

330
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,640
About what?

331
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,720
Please don't call me nosy.

332
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
Well,

333
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,039
it's about the rent here.

334
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,359
But don't worry. I'll handle this.

335
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,440
I'll lend you some money.
I won't just give it to you.

336
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,039
- It's okay.
- Don't turn me down.

337
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,480
I want to help.

338
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,279
We're friends, aren't we?

339
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,920
Hm?

340
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,400
Friends who've only known
each other for two days?

341
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,559
It doesn't matter
how long it's been.

342
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,519
If I feel like it,
I'm happy to lend out my money.

343
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,680
Besides, before the place
became your bar,

344
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,039
it used to be my home.

345
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,920
So that's why you want to come here.

346
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,359
That's right.

347
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,480
I miss my home.

348
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,720
It was a home full of warmth.

349
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,920
It was Mom, Dad,

350
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,960
and tons of memories.

351
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,079
I'm thinking of buying the place
from the current owner.

352
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
If I succeed,

353
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,759
I'll get my home back
and you won't have to pay rent.

354
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,160
Hang on. How does that have
anything to do with me?

355
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,839
We're friends. We have
to have each other's backs.

356
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,079
- But...
- Oh, I need to rest now.

357
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,039
Hey.

358
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,440
Irene?

359
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
Night,

360
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,799
so it wasn't a coincidence Irene
came straight here after she landed.

361
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:51,799
No, it wasn't.

362
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,519
She said she came here
because she missed home

363
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,559
and her dad.

364
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,920
Aunt Jo,

365
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,799
I don't want to accept her money.

366
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,400
We've only known each other
for a few days.

367
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,880
I don't think it's appropriate.

368
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,240
If you're not okay with it,

369
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,480
then make a proper loan agreement.

370
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,799
You can pay her interest as well.

371
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,200
I still feel like I'm taking
advantage of her.

372
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,799
It's 200,000 baht, Aunt Jo.

373
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,319
Her perception of that amount
and ours aren't the same.

374
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,119
She might consider
200,000 chump change.

375
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,880
She'd spend it all
shopping in a second or two.

376
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,200
But for us,

377
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,279
we have to work so hard
and for so long to earn that.

378
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,640
- But...
- That's right.

379
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,240
I might be selfish
for wanting her money.

380
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,799
But we're in a bad place right now,

381
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,359
and she's generous
enough to help us.

382
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,279
I don't think it's a bad thing
for us to accept it.

383
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,079
Besides, we're not thinking
of just taking it either.

384
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,559
Consider it carefully.
She might be heartbroken

385
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,720
if we refuse her generosity.

386
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,119
Okay.

387
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,839
The bar has always
been our dream anyway.

388
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,240
I'll try my best to protect it.

389
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,480
That's right.

390
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,279
It's our dream.

391
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,720
Wait. Sit down and talk.

392
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,440
Yes?

393
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,799
I'm going to throw
a homecoming party for you.

394
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,680
And I'm inviting the shareholders
and the board

395
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,559
so we can talk and relax.

396
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,759
It'd be too formal to parade you
through the company.

397
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,680
I'm worried we'll scare the staff.

398
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,640
A party, Mom?

399
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
Then can there be like EDM music?

400
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,279
I want a dance floor as well.

401
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,440
Irene.

402
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm not coming
if there isn't one. It'll be boring.

403
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,960
How long do you plan
to be a thorn in my side?

404
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,440
Listen. I'm ordering you
to sort yourself out.

405
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,799
Behave nicely

406
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,160
and dye that stupid hair back
to its normal color.

407
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,279
Can you behave like someone
who deserves to be an executive?

408
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,839
And remember this.

409
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,799
I'm going to control
and scrutinize your every step.

410
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,480
I've let you have your freedom
for far too long.

411
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,079
Okay.

412
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,119
I'll do as you say.

413
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,720
What?

414
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,640
But there's a catch.

415
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,519
What?

416
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,720
I'll dye my hair back and behave.

417
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,359
But I have a request
for the day of the party.

418
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,039
What? Hang on.

419
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:05,480
You want me to make cocktails
at your homecoming party?

420
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,440
That's right.

421
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,480
I want you to make Cocktail Irene
so the guests can try it.

422
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,680
I bet everyone's going to love it.

423
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,160
Besides, it's a way to
promote your bar too.

424
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,119
You'll get lots of customers,
then you'll be able to pay the rent.

425
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,359
Oh?

426
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,400
Are you tired?

427
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,119
Not at all.

428
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,559
I'm not used
to your new look at all.

429
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,920
That hair color
actually suits you well.

430
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,240
Mom told me to dye it back.

431
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,160
So, one Cocktail Irene, please?

432
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,000
Just a moment, ma'am.

433
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,359
So that's Irene's friend?

434
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,440
The bar girl?

435
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,960
That's right.
Irene's been visiting her.

436
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,519
What's she like?

437
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,319
As far as I know, she's a good
person. Her background is clean.

438
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,960
A good person?

439
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,359
Someone of her status

440
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,880
isn't suitable to be friends with
a future executive like my daughter.

441
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,360
All right.
That's it for you for tonight.

442
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,079
I'll introduce you to Irene
on her first day at work.

443
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,199
I don't want her to know that
I've asked you to follow her.

444
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,679
Okay, CJ.

445
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,480
Thank you very much
for joining us tonight.

446
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,480
I organized this party
to welcome Irene,

447
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,239
my daughter, back home.

448
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,769
She'll officially become
an executive soon...

449
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,440
I have to go, Irene.

450
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,199
I need to help
Aunt Jo out at the bar.

451
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,400
She might be rather inexperienced.

452
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,519
But I hope

453
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:01,000
everyone will help
and be supportive of her...

454
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,880
I'll ask Aunt Jo to come
and pack up the equipment later.

455
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,679
In any case, please look after me.

456
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,769
Welcome back.

457
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,360
The bar owner happens to be
my ex-girlfriend.

458
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:02,239
Have you thought
of using your ex-girlfriend?

459
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,199
Night?

460
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,480
Tul?

461
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:21,719
Is it so humiliating
that we need to break up?

462
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,960
Doesn't our relationship
mean anything to you?

463
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,360
No!

464
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,519
I'm embarrassed.

465
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,519
We should end things, Night.

466
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,639
You can be with whoever you want.

467
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,119
Find someone who can...

468
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,329
accept it.

469
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,119
- That's a step too far.
- I don't think so.

470
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,039
Didn't you mean to lie to me anyway?

471
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,440
You hid the truth
from me all this time.

472
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,519
I had to find out myself.

473
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,559
We're over.

474
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,599
Let's end it here.

475
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,039
Tul?

476
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:03,000
Tul!

477
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,840
Oh? Night?

478
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Night? Where are you going?

479
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,880
Night, I'm sorry.

480
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
- Night.
- Night!

481
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,480
Who was that?

482
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,360
No idea.
He was asking for directions.

483
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,719
You're leaving, aren't you?
I'll give you a lift.

484
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,639
It's okay.

485
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,289
I'll manage.

486
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,289
I've already called a ride.

487
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
You should head inside.
I can handle this.

488
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:03,769
There's my ride.

489
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,639
Bye.

490
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,289
Night, wait.

491
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,920
Night?

492
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,329
Night?

493
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,639
Night! Night, wait!

494
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,809
Are you a friend of Irene's?

495
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,880
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm her mother.

496
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,769
Hello, ma'am.

497
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,639
I let her bring you here tonight

498
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,039
because I wanted to see you

499
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,920
so I could make up my mind.

500
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,000
Do you think someone like you

501
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,289
is suitable to be friends
with a future executive

502
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,960
at one of the country's
top real estate firms?

503
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:16,840
You don't have to give me
an answer because I'll do it.

504
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,519
And the answer is no.

505
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,679
You can't provide her with anything.

506
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,440
Therefore, sever all contact

507
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,239
with Irene after the party.

508
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't want her to be friends
with someone who works at a bar.

509
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,920
Mom.

510
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,559
What are you harassing her about?

511
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:48,769
What?

512
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:52,079
I just came to see your friend.
Is there a problem with that?

513
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,599
There isn't. But I don't trust you.

514
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,599
Don't give me that attitude.

515
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,079
Who's the untrustworthy one here?

516
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:27,329
Night, it's me!

517
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,769
Irene! You startled me.

518
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:36,840
Why are you smiling?

519
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,360
You're in such good shape.

520
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:49,159
- I'm naked! Get out!
- Night!

521
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,559
- Stay out for now!
- Wait!

522
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,559
- Come on, Night!
- Irene, no!

523
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,599
- Night!
- Behave!

524
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,329
- Night, please!
- No, Irene! Get out now!

525
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,079
- Get out!
- Night!

526
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,289
Night, open up! Night!

527
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,769
I knew you wouldn't
open the door for me

528
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,920
if I rang the bell.

529
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,920
So I asked for the key
from Aunt Joanne.

530
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,039
How did you know
I wouldn't open the door?

531
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,360
I knew Mom must've said
something to you.

532
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,079
I'm sorry on her behalf.

533
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,000
But don't pay her any attention.

534
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,840
Let her blather all she wants.

535
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,119
Don't take it personally.

536
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,400
How can I not care?

537
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,400
She's your mom.

538
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,559
Why would you care about someone
who thinks of and treats you badly?

539
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,679
Trust me.

540
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:11,400
You only need to care about me.

541
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,440
I promise I'll make you
the happiest person on Earth.

542
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,000
Please go out with me.

543
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,239
Hey!

544
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:31,639
Are you crazy? What are you saying?

545
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,809
I know

546
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:40,199
you had bad experiences
with men in the past.

547
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,440
That's how men are.

548
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,119
They don't understand women like us.

549
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:51,000
Give it a try and go out with me.

550
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,639
I promise I'll take care
of you in every way.

551
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:58,400
You'll be
the happiest woman to exist.

552
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,840
Have you thought carefully
about everything you just said?

553
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,769
Yes, I have.

554
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,840
I know what my heart feels,
and I won't waver.

555
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,960
- You should stay away from me.
- But why?

556
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,079
Do you hate me?

557
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,199
Is what my mom said
still bothering you?

558
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,960
No,

559
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,480
I don't hate you.

560
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,800
But we don't have
anything in common.

561
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:49,280
Being women dating each other.

562
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:52,239
Most people aren't
accepting of that.

563
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,840
Our families

564
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,880
and status are strikingly
different too.

565
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,480
You'll look bad
if you go out with me.

566
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,800
- Why are you belittling yourself?
- I'm not.

567
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,039
But it's the truth.

568
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,639
There's another truth about me.

569
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,079
You might be able to move on
from me more easily if you know.

570
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,199
What is it?

571
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:27,199
You probably don't want
to risk looking like a clown

572
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,719
for others to laugh at

573
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,679
if they find out you're dating
someone with a ladyboy father.

574
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,800
A ladyboy father?

575
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,760
Right.

576
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:48,360
Aunt Joanne

577
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,960
isn't my aunt.

578
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,039
She used to be my biological father.

579
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,719
She's a ladyboy.

580
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,760
Do you feel disgusted
now that you know?

581
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:27,599
Don't look down
on anyone's love life.

582
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,719
Everyone is capable of "love"
and "hurt" regardless of gender.

583
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,800
I'm just calling to tell you
I'm saying yes.

584
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,760
I have a girlfriend!

585
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:42,360
The person I'm taking you to meet

586
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,760
is your competitor.

587
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,519
Do anything
in your power to defeat her.

588
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,039
Understand?

589
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:48,679
Are you a good liar?

590
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,800
Say one thing to the mother
and twist the truth to the daughter.

591
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,800
Manipulate them
into fighting each other.

592
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,440
Work hard.

593
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,039
Can I have some moral support?

594
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,400
What are you doing?
I'm not a lesbian like you.

595
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,440
It's my business and not yours.
Don't be nosy.

596
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,159
- Night!
- Cut!

597
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,280
The towel came off too soon.
Do it again.

598
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,199
- Night!
- Ah!

599
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:17,800
Oh? What are you smiling about?

600
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,159
What are you smiling about?

601
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:21,559
Let her look and smile.
Then you say your line.

602
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Look at my hair.

603
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:28,159
Look at the camera now.

604
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,599
Gosh!

605
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:34,079
Why did you dodge me?
