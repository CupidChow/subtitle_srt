1
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,326
Case number 24D810201. Gu Hye-yeong.

2
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,620
Age 19.

3
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,082
Residing in Nam-go, Incheon.

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,293
Indicted for assaulting Shin Ji-won,
Gong Su-jin, and Park Hyeon-a

5
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,087
on June 28, 2020

6
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,215
at a convenience store in Banghwa.

7
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,843
Here's my decision.

8
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,887
Defendant, you were dragged into a fight
between the three victims

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,390
and the convenience store worker,

10
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,309
and thus, I conclude there was no intent.

11
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,645
Rather, you are to be praised
for protecting the weak

12
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,147
who was being ganged up on and assaulted.

13
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,191
Nonetheless,

14
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,944
you hit the three victims first

15
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,448
and have a history of assault,
albeit minor. For that, you should repent.

16
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,534
I thus sentence you

17
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,453
to 10 hours of anti-violence class
and 40 hours of vocational training.

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,039
I won't be so easy on you next time.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,625
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,753
Is there anything you'd like to say?

21
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,755
No.

22
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,178
You have seven days
to request a formal trial. You may go.

23
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,514
Next.

24
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,937
That was so much fun.

25
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,649
Isn't that her?

26
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,654
- Hey. Run.
- Shit.

27
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,921
Shit!

28
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,882
That fucking bitch!

29
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,092
Call the cops. Call the cops on me again!

30
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,053
- Die!
- You bitch!

31
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,304
Let go of me!

32
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,182
Are you mad? You bitch.

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,351
Let go of me!

34
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,103
- Stop messing around.
- You annoying bitch.

35
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,689
- Bitch.
- Dumbass.

36
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,400
You fucking bitch...

37
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,278
Let go!

38
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,244
I'm going to kill you!

39
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,794
Don't touch me. I'll make you regret it.

40
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,225
PIRATE JJAMPPONG

41
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,518
Hello.

42
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,478
Thank you. Come again.

43
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,981
Hye-yeong, watch the register.

44
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,234
Hey.

45
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,820
Bring table two more soup and onions.

46
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,281
- The food was good.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,158
- Keep it up.
- Thank you. Come again.

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,828
Hye-yeong, ring him up.

49
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,040
Hye-yeong. Ring him up. Hey.

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,334
Like hell.

51
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,003
That brat.

52
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,312
- Is that a room?
- Is that her home?

53
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,814
She must live here.

54
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,940
- Ignore her.
- Let's drink.

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,442
Why is there a room here?

56
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,152
- Drink.
- Just ignore it.

57
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,529
- Come on, let's drink.
- Cheers!

58
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,991
- What are you doing?
- Just take it.

59
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,243
Whose side are you on?

60
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,079
- I'm not taking sides.
- Take it back!

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,125
- Come on. Just take it.
- I said to take it back!

62
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,670
- Whatever. I delivered it.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

63
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,839
- Bon-jin.
- Boss!

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,383
- Boss!
- Bon-jin.

65
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,812
Get lost!

66
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,195
Goddamn it.

67
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,496
You can decide after you pay.

68
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,124
Dad's over there, so go wait with him.

69
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,129
How did a burn cost ₩870,000 to treat?
All you did was bandage it.

70
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,257
It's because the insurance policy
is suspended.

71
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,634
So you don't pay all of that.

72
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,135
The insurance policy is suspended...

73
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,765
So, if I pay this now,
the insurance policy will be revived?

74
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,725
Yes. So pay first,

75
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,143
revive the insurance policy,

76
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,688
and bring the receipt in for a refund.

77
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,774
He needs to go home after all.

78
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,277
Shit. So I do have to pay it for now.

79
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:28,953
BASEBALL JACKPOT

80
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,122
BASEBALL JACKPOT

81
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,748
LOTTO

82
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,342
It's maxed out.

83
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,892
That asshole.

84
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,867
How much was the hospital bill?

85
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,622
Is our family broke?

86
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,581
We're not broke.

87
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,041
So why is our insurance suspended?

88
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,543
Why is the card maxed out again?

89
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,756
Send a wire transfer.

90
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,301
What the hell? I have no money.

91
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,552
Revive our medical insurance.

92
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,764
It'll revive my cancer insurance,
expense insurance, and all of that.

93
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,935
I'll get reimbursed double for injuries,
so revive them first.

94
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,728
I'll pay you back.

95
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,231
- You pay for it.
- I would if I had the money.

96
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,733
Exactly. Why don't we have money?

97
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,736
What do you mean? We have money.

98
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,115
Are you betting on horses again?

99
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,368
Give me a break.

100
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,294
Do it now.

101
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,714
Do it now, or they won't reimburse us.
It'll be a pain.

102
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,107
At least you didn't end up in the slammer.

103
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,155
You're an adult now.
I didn't say anything until now,

104
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:32,159
but you should either learn a skill
or go back to school.

105
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,037
I'll clean out a room for you to use.

106
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,791
- Watch how you talk, too.
- Shut it.

107
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,546
Attend an academy, move
into a study dorm... Do something.

108
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,340
You should take the civil service exam.

109
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,927
I'll make sure you won't have to help out
at the restaurant.

110
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,096
You wanted to become
a production director.

111
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,724
You did well in school, too.

112
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,894
You're smart just like your mom.

113
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,440
Why don't you stop
being a loser first then?

114
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,488
Gu Bon-jin.

115
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,741
Gu Bon-jin?

116
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,370
Gu Bon-jin.

117
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,623
Yes.

118
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,674
Let me see.

119
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,847
Dry your face.

120
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,850
Good.

121
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,729
Lift your head.

122
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,485
You might really end up in prison
at this rate.

123
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,820
Shut it.

124
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,863
Are you going to keep acting like this?

125
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,075
He said you're old enough
to go to prison now.

126
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,994
- Who did?
- Dad.

127
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,496
What crap.

128
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,166
Don't worry about me,
and study or you'll end up like me.

129
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,044
I'm not going to study.
I'm going to become a chef.

130
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,337
If you don't study,

131
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,508
you'll become a cook, not a chef.
Just like that loser.

132
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,930
Is Dad betting on horses again?

133
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,433
No? You don't know?

134
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,644
I don't know.

135
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,146
That jackass.

136
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:27,651
Don't worry. We can move out
once I save a little more.

137
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,987
I'm going to live with Dad.

138
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,864
You're such an idiot.

139
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,657
Is that how much you like that loser?

140
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,617
You're the one causing him trouble.

141
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,327
You need to grow up already.

142
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,372
What? He's the reason
we're living like this.

143
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,458
What's this? Are you betraying me?

144
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,336
I need to teach this traitor a lesson.

145
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,672
You gangster.

146
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,383
You want a piece of me?

147
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,598
I can take you.

148
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,024
Get over here.

149
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,276
Get over here.

150
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,320
- Wait right there.
- Get over here.

151
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,031
No, don't do it. Don't you dare!

152
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,325
- Come here.
- Stop it! I said stop!

153
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,327
Stop!

154
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,203
Stop!

155
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,045
COURT MANDATED PROGRAM The vocational training
class will be for 40 hours starting today.

156
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,463
CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY OPERATOR

157
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,464
Gu Hye-yeong?

158
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,135
Starting tomorrow,

159
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,136
come to the practice area out back
since this is a practical training class.

160
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,526
I know you were ordered to attend,
but think of this like an academy.

161
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:10,647
But do take my advice.
Learning this will come in handy.

162
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,108
Before the hands-on training tomorrow,

163
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,486
we'll go over the basics that operators
of construction machinery must know

164
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,906
in order to become certified.

165
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:24,369
MONTHLY RENTAL/SECURITY DEPOSIT

166
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,339
STUDIO IN JUWON, 5 MINUTES FROM
SUBWAY STATION, RENT ₩400,000/MONTH

167
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,885
I wondered if you were a woman
from your name,

168
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,512
and you really are.

169
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,140
I've taught for three years
and never had a female student.

170
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,938
We have a 15-minute break.
Do you want a drink?

171
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,485
You knew what this class was, right?

172
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,613
We have several other classes here, too.

173
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,450
Barista training,
cooking, hair and makeup,

174
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,326
and social services.

175
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,662
They didn't say anything when I signed up.

176
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:08,664
The thing is,

177
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,584
you won't get a job in this field.

178
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,843
Men can get plenty of jobs
once they get certified,

179
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,263
but it isn't fit for women.

180
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,599
What kind of bullshit is that?

181
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,231
I'm not being sexist.

182
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,692
There just aren't any women in the field.

183
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,111
You should learn something
that will get you a job.

184
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,655
You said this is like an academy.

185
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,489
What?

186
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,535
Why is an academy instructor
butting in where he doesn't belong?

187
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,164
This is a great opportunity.

188
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,958
I know many people

189
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,419
who make good money
after getting trained here.

190
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,462
Whatever.

191
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,841
You need to submit my evaluation
to the court!

192
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,261
- If you can't...
- I can. I know how to do it.

193
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,433
Hello. I'm Lieutenant Ko Yu-seok
from Bupyeong Police Station.

194
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,475
Yes?

195
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,270
Gu Bon-jin is your father, correct?

196
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,063
Yes, he is.

197
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,274
Do you know where he is?

198
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,193
Probably at the restaurant.

199
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,695
I'm at the restaurant right now.

200
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,780
Pirate Jjamppong, correct?

201
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,365
What is it?

202
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,743
He was reported for assault.

203
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,373
Someone called in a report
that your father hit someone.

204
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,544
Okay.

205
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,006
They say he fled in the victim's car.

206
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,509
Have you heard from him?

207
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,344
No.

208
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,347
If you do hear from him,

209
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,016
please call me at this number.

210
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,185
Would you call if you were me?

211
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,187
What?

212
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,732
Give me a freaking break.

213
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,363
What are you doing?

214
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,661
Go inside and eat.

215
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm going to be two hours late
Thursday and Friday.

216
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,509
Why?

217
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,929
Vocational training. It's a court order.

218
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,809
Tell Eun-a yourself.

219
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:35,811
Why should I?

220
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,941
Forget it. Just quit then.

221
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,338
Bitch.

222
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,725
It'll be ₩504,000.

223
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,270
- What is?
- My pay up to a minute ago.

224
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,316
I'll wire it.

225
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,110
Are you freaking kidding me?

226
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,199
- What?
- Are you freaking kidding me?

227
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,245
- I don't have the cash, kid.
- Don't talk down to me.

228
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,539
You're the one who fired me.

229
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,343
Watch the restaurant.
I'm going to the bank.

230
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,098
Where's Dad?

231
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,687
He's lost his mind.
He's just hanging out, is that it?

232
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,523
Did you eat?

233
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,402
Stop eating that. I'll bring you dinner.

234
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,786
What is he doing?

235
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,835
- You must be hungry.
- Yes.

236
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,047
Want a fried egg?

237
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,231
Lieutenant.

238
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:45,983
Just a minute.

239
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,376
Is that Gu Bon-jin?

240
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,588
I'm Lieutenant Ko Yu-seok.
We spoke earlier.

241
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,632
What... What's going on?

242
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,178
The doctor will be right here.

243
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,016
Here are your father's belongings.

244
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,228
The doctor says he's just passed out.

245
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,938
Call me when he wakes up.

246
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,108
I'll call you in the morning.

247
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,818
What happened?

248
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,987
He drove through the rail
and off a bridge.

249
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,989
Since it was a stolen car, the car owner...

250
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,825
- Stolen car?
- Yes.

251
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,994
The car owner confirmed his identity.

252
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,998
I'll ask him for the details
once he wakes up.

253
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,625
Okay, then.

254
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,010
Excuse me. Are you Gu Bon-jin's guardian?

255
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:00,181
Hello. I'm Kim In-yeong
from Samhwa Insurance.

256
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,433
Is your mother here?

257
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,646
I'm sure you're in shock,

258
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,482
but this will only get worse
for both parties if you delay.

259
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,734
When will she get here?

260
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,070
Look. This is the emergency room.

261
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,404
You can't stay here.

262
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,281
You said the doctor was coming.

263
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,533
He'll be here soon.

264
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,078
Wait outside for now.

265
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,547
Your father caused an accident
in a stolen car.

266
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:35,299
I'll leave out the complicated
criminal matters and make it simple.

267
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,302
He was uninsured
when he caused the accident.

268
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,638
Usually, the insurance companies
negotiate among themselves.

269
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:44,058
But in this situation,
you'll have to settle with the family...

270
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,688
I mean, with our insurance company
as their agent.

271
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,940
My brother and I are the only family.

272
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,316
I have to settle with my brother?

273
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,319
No. The victim's family.

274
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,490
Settle with the car owner's family?

275
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:03,453
The thing is... You have to
talk to the car owner separately.

276
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,624
You don't know yet.

277
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,587
Well...
When your father caused the accident,

278
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:16,090
he hit two people. It was a car accident.

279
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,677
- So...
- That asshole.

280
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,182
I'm with the victims' insurance company.

281
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,309
First of all,
the victims are hospitalized.

282
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,643
They will receive treatment.

283
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,604
We will propose a settlement amount

284
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,647
and notify Gu Bon-jin's guardian.

285
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm not Gu Bon-jin's guardian.
I'm his daughter.

286
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,946
Talk to that asshole
about the settlement when he wakes up.

287
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,073
I know nothing about it.

288
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,953
Did you pack the paper and scissors?

289
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,456
We don't have art today.

290
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,670
If by chance someone comes and asks
questions, say you don't know anything.

291
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,672
Okay?

292
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,842
What do you mean?

293
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,095
I don't know. Just in case.

294
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,766
Later.

295
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,729
Hye-jeok.

296
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,238
If a teacher or other kids pick on you,

297
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,990
bring them out the back during lunch.

298
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,578
- Okay?
- Stop that.

299
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,748
- Bye now.
- Bye.

300
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:37,964
Hello?

301
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,092
Are you Gu Bon-jin's daughter?

302
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,261
Who is this?

303
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:45,179
Where is Gu Bon-jin?

304
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,889
Who are you?

305
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,350
I work with your father.

306
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,644
I can't reach him.

307
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,896
How did you get my number?

308
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,773
Where is Gu Bon-jin right now, kid?

309
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,652
- Bitch, how did you get my number?
- What? Bitch?

310
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,157
Did Mr. Gu go somewhere?

311
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,535
He's in the hospital.

312
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,620
When will he be back?

313
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:12,206
- Not today.
- Did he get hurt again?

314
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,041
He was in an accident yesterday.

315
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,295
An accident? What kind of accident?

316
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,212
I don't know either.

317
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,132
What about the restaurant?
Should we close for the day?

318
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,551
- Hello.
- Hello.

319
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,552
Hi.

320
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,306
So? Should we close?

321
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:29,558
I don't know.

322
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,270
Can we open today?

323
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,107
That's not the issue.
Should I try calling him?

324
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,569
Dad isn't in right now.

325
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,446
He isn't?

326
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,365
I was supposed to see him this morning.

327
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,119
- Did he go somewhere?
- He's in the hospital.

328
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,039
Is his arm really bad?

329
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,874
Bad enough to cost a fortune.

330
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:55,959
What?

331
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,796
Nothing. Never mind.
I'll tell him to call you.

332
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,632
Then give this...

333
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,009
That'll be ₩450,000.

334
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,055
Our boss is in the hospital
and won't be back today.

335
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,056
What?

336
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,018
He said he'd pay off the balance today.

337
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,769
Why is he in the hospital?

338
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,231
- I'll come back another time.
- We don't know either.

339
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:20,024
I have to get paid today.

340
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:23,194
I don't know
if he wants us to work or not.

341
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,529
Even yesterday's ingredients...

342
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,323
Just close.
The boss isn't here anyway.

343
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:30,576
We only got half
our pay last month, too.

344
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:34,122
We already closed yesterday.
If we close again today...

345
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,338
Pull back. Back.

346
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,883
Wait. Stop. Get out.

347
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:46,802
Get out.

348
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,971
May I go for an interview later?

349
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,055
Yes.

350
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,225
Okay.

351
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,025
Hello?

352
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,653
Are you Gu Bon-jin's daughter?

353
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,574
Who is this?

354
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,659
My name is Park.

355
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,120
Do you know where he is?

356
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,249
How did you get this number?

357
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,418
I can't reach your father.

358
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,629
Answer me. How did you get this number?

359
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:26,757
Look. A person shouldn't
suddenly cut off communication like this.

360
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,719
I'm an educated person.

361
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,429
He died.

362
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,391
Gu Bon-jin's dead,
so don't call me. Got it?

363
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,270
Hye-yeong!

364
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,441
Hye-yeong!

365
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,621
If a girl isn't pretty,
she should at least have a nice body

366
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,290
or be amiable.

367
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,418
Life must be tough for you.

368
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,670
If you're going to be like that,
just quit.

369
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,508
Don't be a nuisance to the others.
You're wasting my time, too.

370
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,040
- Hye-yeong.
- What's wrong?

371
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,044
The second floor is very basic, too.

372
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,506
It's amazing
that people actually come here.

373
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,008
You must've been right.

374
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,926
The decor doesn't matter.

375
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,178
Who are you?

376
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,222
But the kitchen is big and clean.

377
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,476
So she's the big sister.

378
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:46,063
Sure. It's nice
how it opens into the kitchen.

379
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:47,607
I asked who you were.

380
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,442
Why did they build a room?

381
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,570
Isn't it uncomfortable?
It hurts your back to sit on the floor.

382
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,323
We'll get rid of it and put in tables.

383
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,867
We're closed, so please leave.

384
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:59,369
- No...
- We're not customers.

385
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,330
Upstairs.

386
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,790
- Remember what I told you? So...
- Who are you people?

387
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,584
We need to put up a wall.

388
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,170
Who are you?

389
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:16,344
We're taking over two weeks from now.

390
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:17,721
He's Chairman Choi's nephew.

391
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,724
She must not know yet.

392
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,936
It's okay. I already spoke to your dad
on the phone.

393
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,022
Everything's been already, so don't worry.

394
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,814
Where is he, anyway?

395
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,527
You're taking over?
My dad said he'd sell the restaurant?

396
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:36,864
How could your dad sell it
when it isn't even his?

397
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,408
- Your dad said he'd leave.
- Leave?

398
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,660
Why would he leave?

399
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,662
The adults already finished discussing it.

400
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,956
She is so freaking loud.

401
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,251
We said we'd come by today

402
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:52,338
but we can't reach him.
Is your dad home?

403
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,966
Get out, assholes!

404
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,683
- Get out.
- Oh, my.

405
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:04,935
I said get the fuck out!

406
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,064
- Babe!
- Eun-ji, hurry.

407
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,902
Call your uncle. Now.

408
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,781
- Okay. Hold on.
- She's a total psycho!

409
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,545
Hey. Where's the patient that was here?

410
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,506
Are you Gu Bon-jin's guardian?

411
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,091
Yes.

412
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,595
What took you so long to come?
We couldn't reach you.

413
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,348
- What the hell?
- He's in surgery.

414
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,100
His vitals suddenly dropped,

415
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,352
so he went in for emergency surgery
30 minutes ago.

416
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,104
Emergency?

417
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,899
The doctor will explain everything
once he gets out.

418
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,903
Wait right here.
You have to sign the consent form.

419
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:26,307
BON-JIN, CALL ME BACK

420
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,143
PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS

421
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:43,991
CAMERA

425
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,592
Thank you for calling Yuhan Insurance.

426
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,637
To report a car accident…

427
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,019
CHAIRMAN CHOI YEONG-HWAN

428
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,405
The person you have reached is not
available.

429
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:25,033
Please leave a message after...

430
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,372
Are you Gu Bon-jin's guardian?

431
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,380
We'll have to run some more tests,

432
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,383
but we suspect he's brain-dead.

433
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,761
Brain-dead?

434
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,598
You said let's see once he wakes up.

435
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:51,058
- I never said that.
- What are you talking about?

436
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,519
The detective said
the doctor told him that.

437
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,230
Detective? Who?

438
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,024
It wasn't me.

439
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,443
It didn't look good from the start.

440
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:03,322
The impact was severe,
and it was a while before he got here.

441
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,493
We'll test for reflexes for now.

442
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,495
Let's wait two to three days.

443
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,291
But you should prepare yourself.

444
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:05,634
POLICE LINE
DO NOT CROSS

445
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:45,007
Hey!
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

446
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,955
I'm family to the driver.

447
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,333
Hello.

448
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,252
I went to the site this morning,

449
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:25,088
but I haven't heard the details yet.

450
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,384
Well...

451
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,138
Who is she?

452
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,433
She seems to be
related to the driver.

453
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,021
I went to the accident site this morning.

454
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:43,272
And?

455
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,150
I want to know how the accident occurred.

456
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,360
I see.

457
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,780
What is your relationship with the driver?

458
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,368
I'm his daughter.

459
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,288
Is your mother busy?

460
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,918
When can she come here?

461
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:04,795
She isn't coming.

462
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,508
We have nothing to say.

463
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,971
There's no crosswalk
or anywhere for people to go.

464
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,056
Don't talk to her.

465
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,559
We told the police everything.

466
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,272
Were you there, lady?

467
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,234
- What?
- Were you hit by the car, lady?

468
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:32,488
The person who was hit by the car
obviously can't speak right now.

469
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,784
That's why I'm asking her.
Why are you butting in?

470
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,911
- It's not like it was raining.
- An accident...

471
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,663
The car didn't cross into the sidewalk.

472
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:43,457
If it happened in the middle of the road,
it means you ran into the road.

473
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,918
Didn't the police tell you?

474
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:46,795
Didn't the police come to you?

475
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,714
Why are you bringing up the police?

476
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:51,090
I'm asking what happened.

477
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,758
Why do we need the police?

478
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:55,261
All you got were a few bandages.
My dad's brain-dead.

479
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,222
What did you do
for him to end up like that?

480
00:34:58,223 --> 00:34:59,641
I'm speechless.

481
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:01,475
You caused the accident, right?

482
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,894
You ran in and my dad couldn't avoid...

483
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:06,315
Your dad was wasted
at the time of the accident.

484
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,985
It's been three days since he hit them,

485
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:12,529
but no adult's come by yet.

486
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,531
Look at him lying there.
Instead of apologizing,

487
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,284
you accuse us of causing the accident?

488
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:19,870
What an insolent brat.

489
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,872
Excuse me!

490
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:24,832
Get her out of here!

491
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,335
I don't know whether he caused
the accident or was the victim.

492
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:28,504
So why would I apologize?

493
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,423
The victim?

494
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,219
Get out.

495
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,221
How dare you pull that crap here?

496
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:39,306
Get out!

497
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:43,684
Did you just touch me?

498
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,187
Go bring your mom.

499
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,190
Why are you bringing up my mom?
My mom's dead, you bitch!

500
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:51,567
- What's wrong with you?
- Was it my fault? Did I hit them?

501
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,654
- Why are you taking it out on me?
- Get rid of her.

502
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,907
Let go. Let go of me.

503
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:58,742
Bitch.

504
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,515
It's under construction,
so there's no walkway.

505
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:23,892
So why did you cross over?

506
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,103
I have no reason to tell you that.

507
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,522
There's no crosswalk either.

508
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,067
A lot of people cross there
to look at the skyline.

509
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,945
Exactly. So he hit people
who were jaywalking.

510
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,489
The car came at us!

511
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,118
Talk to the police.
Why are you bothering me?

512
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,536
What's your problem?

513
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:45,455
- I need to know...
- What's wrong with you?

514
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:52,796
Doesn't this hurt?

515
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,513
Help! Somebody help!

516
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:10,230
Are you guys scammers or something?

517
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:22,034
Excuse me. Where are you going?

518
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,705
Where's the patient?

519
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,415
He was discharged.

520
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,125
Discharged?

521
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,461
I thought he was unconscious.

522
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:34,838
He was discharged.

523
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:39,467
Were they really injured?

524
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:42,012
Did they just put bandages on and fake it?

525
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:47,308
- You have their number, right?
- I don't know.

526
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,561
I know they had to fill it out
when he was admitted.

527
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:51,355
I can't tell you.

528
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,774
Stop causing a scene, kid.

529
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,653
Is this Gu Hye-yeong?

530
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,530
This is Kim from Samhwa Insurance.

531
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:04,075
My client says you went to them
and caused a scene.

532
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,576
I caused a scene?

533
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,455
I'm their agent. You need to talk to me.

534
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,706
Why can't I meet them in person?

535
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,834
You can't cause a scene.

536
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:14,752
They may report you to the police.

537
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:15,838
I caused a scene?

538
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,131
They can report me all they want.

539
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:22,343
It looks like they caused the accident
and are dumping it on my dad.

540
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:24,137
Ms. Gu!

541
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,640
That's for the police to investigate.

542
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,767
You can't go to them
and cause a scene like that.

543
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:33,354
I saw it myself. She's faking the injury.
The bandage is a prop.

544
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,981
You think I'm stupid?

545
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,817
I said to leave.

546
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:41,487
I didn't say you were stupid.

547
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,281
You stay out of it.

548
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:46,033
I'll talk to them myself,
so give me their number.

549
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,119
Can't you even do that?

550
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,997
I'll ask my client and get back to you.

551
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,624
Tell them that I won't settle
or give them anything

552
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,460
if they won't talk to me in person.

553
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:03,802
Where's Dad?

554
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,892
Dad...

555
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,106
needs to stay in the hospital longer.

556
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,108
Just focus on school.

557
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,153
Are you okay?

558
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,005
Should I get a tattoo like you?

559
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,134
Why? Is someone picking on you?

560
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,183
You don't need these things. You have me.

561
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,568
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

562
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,695
- If you have something to say, say it.
- I don't.

563
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:07,281
- I said to say it.
- I have nothing to say.

564
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,282
Hey!

565
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:11,995
Ms. Gu Hye-yeong?

566
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,331
Please.

567
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,129
How's your father?

568
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,511
He's taking a while to recover.

569
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:32,306
The victims seem to be fine.

570
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,600
- You don't need to worry.
- What?

571
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,019
They are now receiving
outpatient treatment from home.

572
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,938
We confirmed their address.

573
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:41,524
The insurance company says
everything is normal.

574
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,984
Her arm is fine, but she bandaged it,

575
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:44,777
he lied in bed claiming...

576
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,989
Look. That's what they all do
when they're in an accident.

577
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,074
That's how you get more
from the insurance company.

578
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,618
That isn't considered a scam.

579
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,258
What if they ran in front of the car
in order to cause the accident?

580
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,667
We're investigating that.

581
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:01,711
She's back.

582
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,214
Did she beat someone up again?
She hasn't changed.

583
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:05,924
That's not it.

584
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,384
She's a pain in the ass.

585
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:09,970
Did you ask her why she hit them?

586
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,930
Shit.

587
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,933
Have you lost your mind?

588
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:18,144
Why that little jackass.

589
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,229
- Okay, just calm down.
- Let go!

590
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,816
Let go of me! What the hell?

591
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:24,860
Fine, fine!

592
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,114
Have you heard of Korea Equipment Trading?

593
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,784
My dad used to work there.

594
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,328
When?

595
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,414
About seven or eight years ago.

596
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,168
Is that when he opened the restaurant?

597
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,756
Remember how I said
he assaulted someone the other day?

598
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,549
That's where it was.

599
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,720
The car that he stole was their CEO,
Choi Yeong-hwan's car.

600
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:54,473
Do you know anything else?

601
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,976
Did you have any problems recently
at home?

602
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,521
Like money problems?

603
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,983
Was your father
suffering from depression or anything?

604
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:08,195
Was he in any kind of therapy?

605
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:11,864
Why?

606
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,159
When did your mother pass away?

607
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:16,912
About seven or eight years ago.

608
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,122
Right when he quit.

609
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,459
Did he have a hard time
when your mother passed away?

610
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:26,004
I looked into it,

611
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:28,674
and he's deep in debt.

612
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,260
He owes people he knows
and loan sharks, too.

613
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,304
Some say he was mentally unstable.

614
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:36,722
Mentally?

615
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,391
- Who?
- Your father.

616
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,853
- Who said that crap?
- I'm saying

617
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,564
your father may have left a suicide note,
so...

618
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:47,276
A suicide note?
Are you saying he killed himself?

619
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,653
Did you see the accident site?

620
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,947
They ran into the road
where there's no crosswalk.

621
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:55,283
This happened
because he was trying to avoid them!

622
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:56,826
You should check the surveillance videos

623
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,786
rather than tell me
to look for a suicide note.

624
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,999
The area's under construction,
so there are no cameras.

625
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:11,383
Your father recently
renewed his insurance policy.

626
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,427
No, he didn't renew it.

627
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:16,512
He revived it the day before the accident.

628
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:17,889
So? What about it?

629
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,599
That's because his medical insurance...

630
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,226
He revived all three policies.

631
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,937
He got them
when your mother passed away,

632
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,564
which included life insurance.

633
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:28,399
They were all suspended,

634
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,067
but were revived
the day before the accident.

635
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,527
That was because he burned his arm.

636
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:33,070
We revived them to pay for that.

637
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:34,364
Insurance isn't retroactive.

638
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,783
What does "retroactive" mean?

639
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:40,245
You can't be compensated for injuries
that occur prior to revival.

640
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:49,004
The policies all name his daughter
as the beneficiary. You.

641
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,967
The latest payment
came from your bank account, too.

642
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:03,185
Well. So from what you saw,
you didn't see signs of that, correct?

643
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:06,230
We'll take that into consideration.

644
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:09,274
I'll be in touch.

645
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,443
Answer your phone.

646
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,613
What idiot kills himself
to give someone else money?

647
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,199
A lot of people
have been doing that lately.

648
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,660
And family isn't "someone else."

649
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,330
Are you the one who took my call?

650
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:27,500
- Are you Gu Bon-jin's daughter?
- We had to delay our construction.

651
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,378
- Why did you lock up the restaurant?
- Are you the one who said he died?

652
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:33,881
- We can't reach him.
- He begged when he needed the money.

653
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:35,466
He shouldn't go off the grid like this.

654
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,760
He must've told you where he was.

655
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,345
When did he turn off his phone?

656
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,472
Hey, you. Give us a copy of that key.

657
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:43,516
You need to stop interfering like this.

658
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,893
Where are you going?
What do you take us for?

659
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,979
- Where's your dad?
- That's enough.

660
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,856
I already gave out our invitations.

661
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,899
You're hurting Chairman Choi's reputation.

662
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,151
You must know where your dad is.

663
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,403
He's in the hospital.

664
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:57,488
What hospital? Which hospital?
What are you talking about?

665
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:58,949
He's in the hospital!

666
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,993
- Hey.
- Hey, you!

667
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:04,788
- What are you doing? Open the door!
- Break down the door!

668
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,583
- Break it down!
- Go ahead! Just try it!

00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,515
This is Kim with Samhwa Insurance.

674
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:08,059
I'll send you
our proposed settlement amount.

675
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,520
Usually, we include any side effects
that may occur after treatment ends

676
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:12,355
and proceed later on.

677
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:14,357
But my client doesn't want to
drag this out,

678
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:16,234
and would like to end this now.

For the first victim, Kim Eun-seok,
₩40,000,000.

For the second victim, Lee Gyeong-jin...

CHAIRMAN CHOI YEONG-HWAN

682
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:37,338
Hye-yeong, isn't that you?

683
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:41,217
- Hello.
- You're all grown up now.

684
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:44,012
You look like a young woman.
Your dad is well, I assume?

685
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,265
Sure. He's just...

686
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:49,100
I've been meaning to visit.

687
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,978
I'll come over soon with some coworkers.

688
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,234
May I help you?

689
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:00,153
I came to see Chairman Choi Yeong-hwan.

690
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:03,949
- What is it about?
- I need to ask him something.

691
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,660
And you are?

692
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,871
I'm Gu Bon-jin's daughter.

693
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:13,667
He's busy right now.
You should come back another time.

694
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:21,675
Mister.

695
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,804
She's Gu Bon-jin's daughter.

696
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:27,973
Okay.

697
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,767
It's you. You've gotten big.

698
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,146
So? Did your dad wake up?

699
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:38,483
- No.
- Then?

700
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,413
Mister.

701
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:56,668
Why was Dad here?

702
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:00,881
- Hey, kid. Get out.
- Did you tell my dad to leave?

703
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:12,266
Get in.

704
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:14,686
Sir.

705
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,522
It's the analytical report
from the merchants' association.

706
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:19,148
The afternoon records
will be available later.

707
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:20,984
Send it to me via Telegram
when you get it.

708
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:36,875
Yes, Mr. Park. He'll be arriving soon.

709
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,752
Wait at the market entrance.

710
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,587
Yes, we have it all set up.

711
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:42,922
No, you don't need that.

712
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:45,258
It's big, so you can just go.

713
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:46,343
Okay.

714
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:54,977
I heard you've been causing trouble
ever since you ran away from home.

715
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:01,441
How did someone like Bon-jin
have a daughter like you?

716
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,238
What did you say to my dad?

717
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,700
I told him to leave
since the lease was up.

718
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:12,160
Why? Is that wrong?

719
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,746
My dad tore down the snack shop

720
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,456
and built a Chinese restaurant there.

721
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:18,750
So why is that yours?

722
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,588
Do you know how big that lot is?
How could your dad afford that?

723
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:26,382
Your dad blew his savings on the track
and was drunk all the time,

724
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:29,552
so I was afraid he'd end up
killing himself or someone else.

725
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:33,306
That's why I lent him the land
since it wasn't being used.

726
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:35,475
It was abandoned land.

727
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:38,103
There's no such thing as abandoned land.

728
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,272
Why don't you find some then?

729
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:43,608
Look.

730
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:47,529
Eight years ago,
I gave your dad an opportunity.

731
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,532
He benefited enough from it.
It's time to pass it on.

732
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:52,742
Don't you agree?

733
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:54,411
We're almost there, sir.

734
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,373
Regardless,
your dad and I reached an agreement.

735
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,919
You should pack up first and get ready.

736
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:04,338
I'll pay for some of your moving expenses.

737
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:07,716
We're not complete strangers after all.

738
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:15,640
HYE-JEOK

739
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,141
- Choi Yeong-hwan!
- Choi Yeong-hwan!

740
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:20,144
We should help each other out.
Don't you agree?

741
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:21,979
- Choi Yeong-hwan!
- We'll see each other again.

742
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,106
- Choi Yeong-hwan!
- Choi Yeong-hwan!

743
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,651
- Let's go.
- Vote number one, Choi Yeong-hwan!

744
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:29,237
- Choi Yeong-hwan!
- Choi Yeong-hwan!

745
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,947
- Choi Yeong-hwan!
- Choi Yeong-hwan!

746
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:32,573
Mister.

747
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:33,908
Mister.

748
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,284
Mister.

749
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,161
Wasn't it your car
that was in the accident?

750
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,329
What's wrong with you?

751
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,164
And you're the one
who reported him for assault.

752
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:41,959
I know nothing about that.

753
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,419
If he agreed to leave,
why did he get violent?

754
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,296
Let's talk later. Get rid of her.

755
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,091
What did you say to my dad?

756
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,260
Let go. Let go of me.

757
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:58,433
- Vote number one, Choi Yeong-hwan!
- Vote number one, Choi Yeong-hwan!

758
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,104
What is it?

759
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,939
- Choi Yeong-hwan!
- Choi Yeong-hwan!

760
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,483
What? Speak properly.

761
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,695
PIRATE JJAMPPONG

762
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:41,185
Hye-jeok.

763
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:44,771
Hye-yeong!

764
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:04,708
Who is it?

765
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:12,841
Hye-yeong?

766
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:15,134
Auntie.

767
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,513
Hey. Come in.

768
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,431
Come in.

769
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:22,892
- Hye-jeok!
- Hye-jeok!

770
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:24,894
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

771
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:26,021
Hi guys.

772
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:28,190
Hye-jeok.

773
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:30,150
Come here.

774
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:35,280
He's gotten so big.

775
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,783
He must've started school by now.

776
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:39,701
Yes. Last year.

777
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,829
- Where's Uncle?
- He went to Daejeon.

778
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:46,375
He's working.
He won't be back until tomorrow.

779
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:50,587
He came to the restaurant a few days ago.

780
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:54,049
Yeah, I heard.

781
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,183
Here.

782
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:06,144
Thank you.

783
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,775
It's been a while since I had your sikhye.

784
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:16,655
Right. It's been about two years, right?

785
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:19,533
Yes, about three years.

786
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:33,296
Do you mind if Hye-jeok
sleeps here just for tonight?

787
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,841
I'm fine, but he has nowhere to sleep.

788
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,345
Are you moving out today?

789
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:42,139
Moving out?

790
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:45,267
No, that's not it.

791
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:50,856
When are you moving?

792
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:54,943
We're not moving.

793
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:06,663
Let's see if we have any clean blankets.

794
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,590
We'll just leave if it's an inconvenience.

795
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:27,351
Hye-jeok, let's go.

796
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,436
Hye-jeok!

797
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,813
Get your butt out here.

798
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:38,278
No. Sleep here tonight. It's been so long.

799
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,911
What is this?

800
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:48,746
What is this? Who did this?

801
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:50,957
- It's nothing.
- Was it those people?

802
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,333
I said it's nothing.

803
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:54,586
- "Those people"?
- Tell me.

804
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:56,879
Who did this?

805
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,422
I just fell.

806
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:00,801
Should I show you what happens
when you "just fall"?

807
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:03,261
Did those people do this?

808
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:05,513
I just fell. Stop it.

809
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:06,974
What people?

810
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:12,980
Let's go. Let's go to the police tomorrow.

811
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,190
Is it because of your dad?

812
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:17,526
Did people come to your place?

813
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,737
Oh my gosh. Are you kids okay?

814
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,156
My gosh. To this small child...

815
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,869
How could they do this?

816
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:30,746
What's wrong with your father?

817
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:32,416
Look at this mess.

818
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:37,962
Why can't he just take a loss by himself?

819
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:39,630
No, it's not even a loss.

820
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,175
All he had to do
was be a little less greedy.

821
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,302
Fighting back won't solve this.

822
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,388
How is he so selfish?

823
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:52,310
I try to tell myself
he wants to provide a better life

824
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:53,311
for his kids, but...

825
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:54,979
Dad fought back?

826
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,441
That's right! But enough is enough!

827
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,489
Your dad is always like that.

828
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,408
His addiction to the tracks
killed your mom,

829
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:10,369
and he makes everyone near him miserable,
but he says he did nothing wrong.

830
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,830
All he ever cared about
was making his money back.

831
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,958
What did he do wrong?

832
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,238
Do you know why your dad won't leave,
and is fighting back?

833
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:21,214
When he built the second floor
two years ago,

834
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:22,924
the chairman said not to spend the money

835
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:24,884
since there was only two years left
in the lease.

836
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:26,636
But what did your dad say?

837
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:27,720
Don't worry.
"I'll make more than what I put I

838
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:29,889
within two years."

839
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,766
I swear I'll leave after two years.

840
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:34,561
"If you don't believe me,
Yong-su will be a witness."

841
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,354
Is he insane?

842
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:38,648
How could he profit 500 million
in two years?

843
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:40,858
Five hundred million won!

844
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:43,903
What did your uncle do wrong?
He was just a witness.

845
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:45,155
Hye-jeok, let's go.

846
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:49,408
He said he'd move out.
Why's he still sitting on his ass?

847
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:52,328
The chairman won't give your uncle
any work.

848
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:54,372
We'll all die at this rate!

849
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:57,167
Hye-yeong. Talk to your dad
about this, okay?

850
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:02,714
The doctor said Dad's brain-dead.

851
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,467
Anyway, I'm sorry.

852
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,974
- Brain-dead?
- Get out here!

853
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:13,642
Good night.

854
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,186
Hye-yeong!

855
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,070
What does being "brain-dead" mean?

856
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:48,010
You've gotten a lot better.

857
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:50,387
Shut it.

858
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:55,392
Hye-yeong, look here.

859
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:58,895
Shit.

860
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,230
Come on, look.

861
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:07,695
GALLERY
AUDIO RECORDER

862
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:09,740
RECORDED AUDIO FILE

863
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:15,786
RECORDED AUDIO FILE

864
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,789
Choi Yeong-hwan!

865
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:30,885
Shit!

866
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:32,595
- Hey, Bon-jin.
- Stab me with this knife...

867
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,556
- threaten me?
- Stop him!

868
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:47,401
How may I help you?

869
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:49,654
I heard Chairman Choi was here.

870
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:50,906
Yes, just a minute.

871
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,116
Who should I say is here?

872
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,744
Well... Tell him Gu Bon-jin is here.
He'll know.

873
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:57,745
Okay.

874
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:03,292
Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Gu Bon-jin is here to see you.

875
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:05,920
- Excuse me.
- Why you...

876
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:07,255
I'm sorry.

877
00:59:07,256 --> 00:59:09,382
Mr. Chairman,
I just need to say one thing. One thing.

878
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:10,717
Do it next time. Next time.

879
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:13,469
- Mr. Chairman.
- What are you doing?

880
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:14,680
Let him be.

881
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,173
CHOI YEONG-HWAN FOR ASSEMBLYMAN

882
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:34,783
Go on.

883
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,757
What are you doing?

884
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,766
This is the last time I'll say this.

885
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,937
If I go back on my word,
stab me with this knife and kill me.

886
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:12,361
I'll pay you two million won more.

887
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,739
I'll give you
another two million every month.

888
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,241
If the new tenants use that
to provide for themselves for now...

889
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:18,659
Hey, Bon-jin.

890
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,788
I'm telling you to just leave
because I can't stand you anymore.

891
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:25,041
Forget the stupid lease. Just get out!

892
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:27,168
I don't know what I did to upset you,

893
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:28,253
- but...
- Hey!

894
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:32,466
I don't need the extra money.
It's not about that. Just get out.

895
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:34,426
Okay?

896
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,055
It's too late to laugh about it
and shake hands now.

897
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,515
Look at you.

898
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:43,060
You go around making me out to be a liar.

899
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,688
I couldn't keep my promise
because of my circumstances.

900
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:49,816
That's different from lying.

901
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:55,238
If you had done as I said
and pulled out your restaurant,

902
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,740
I would've helped you again later.

903
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,912
Look how you treat me.
Why should I be nice to you?

904
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:05,332
Look how you show up with a knife
and threaten me.

905
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,794
I'm offended.

906
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:11,755
Sir, we don't have time.

907
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:15,509
Mr. Chairman.

908
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,808
I'll raise it to
three million per month.

909
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:25,393
So please give me two more years.

910
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:27,855
I won't ask for anything more.

911
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:50,627
I don't need that chump change.

912
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,462
But

913
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,674
I have to report my assets soon.

914
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,845
It looks bad if I own buildings.

915
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,223
That's why I sold it.

916
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,268
Go to the new building owner
and beg him.

917
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:08,770
Stop bugging me.

918
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,400
Come on. Get up.

919
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:16,570
Get up. Get up, okay?

920
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:27,623
Then

921
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:30,083
I'll pack up and leave.

922
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,046
Give me two weeks.

923
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:37,966
It's not your choice.
You have to get out.

924
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:42,428
Anyway, good call.

925
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,848
I'll talk to him.
I'm sure I can get you two weeks.

926
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:46,725
Let's go.

927
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,855
But you have to reimburse me
400 million for the improvements.

928
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,691
It's actually 100 million more,

929
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:58,612
but I feel bad asking for all of it.

930
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:14,086
What are you talking about?

931
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,755
You should reimburse me
for the cost of building the second floor.

932
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,007
Why should I? You built it on your own.

933
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:21,260
I built it

934
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:25,263
because you told me to use it
for 10 or 20 years. As long as I wanted.

935
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:27,850
Why would I spend 500 million won
on someone else's building?

936
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:32,603
If I meant for you to use it
for 10 or 20 years,

937
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:34,063
I would've said that in the lease.

938
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:36,983
You said you only gave two-year leases.

939
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,526
You said that was your policy.

940
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:42,030
That's why you made Yong-su be a witness!

941
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:44,157
Should I call him here?

942
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,243
My nephew

943
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:49,454
plans to tear down that crap hole

944
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:52,665
and build a large driving range.

945
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,292
He already got the permit.

946
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:56,377
Who pays for improvements
to a building being torn down?

947
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:57,754
Don't you agree?

948
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,233
What driving range? He's coming tomorrow
to work on the interior.

949
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:07,472
Are you doing this...

950
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:10,601
to pocket the improvement cost?

951
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:15,646
You dirty thief!

952
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,024
- Has this asshole lost his mind?
- Let go of me.

953
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:21,027
- Get him out of here!
- You have no respect for me, but still!

954
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,029
- You're finished.
- What bullshit is this?

955
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,324
- Evict him tomorrow.
- Tell Yong-su to come here!

956
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:29,160
In Nam-go, Incheon, Choi Yeong-hwan
of the People's Freedom Party

957
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:32,747
and Ji Won-suk of the Democratic
Citizens' Party are neck and neck.

958
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:35,708
Green Democratic Party's Ahn Jeong-ho
is right on their heels.

959
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,002
That is the dominant view.

960
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:40,630
I'll probably either win by a small margin

961
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:43,341
or win by a huge margin.

962
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,051
That's what I think.

963
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,469
I can do it.

964
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:50,264
Each candidate is focused on
tying up any loose ends

965
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:52,266
that might affect
the last leg of their campaigns.

966
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:55,144
These last efforts just might be
the deciding factor in this election.

967
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:56,395
Hello...

968
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,481
Hey.

969
01:04:58,482 --> 01:04:59,483
Hey, you!

970
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:03,904
Where's Choi Yeong-hwan?

971
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:06,949
What's your problem?
He isn't coming in today.

972
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,537
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

973
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:14,414
Where is he?

974
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:17,751
I really don't know.

975
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,548
CHOI YEONG-HWAN

976
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:34,892
This is Choi Yeong-hwan's campaign office.

977
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:37,645
- How may I help you?
- What's his schedule for today?

978
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:38,856
Who may I ask is calling?

979
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:41,441
I'm a reporter.

980
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:03,255
- Please give me your support.
- Yes, I'll do my best...

981
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:07,217
Leave my home alone.

982
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,470
And apologize to my dad right now.

983
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:16,476
This is what I told you about.

984
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:19,313
If you give them an inch,
they ask for a mile.

985
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:22,982
I saved them from drowning,
and they want to mug me.

986
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:24,317
He's a total thief.

987
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,029
My nephew plans
to tear down that crap hole

988
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,906
and build an indoor golf facility.

989
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:31,532
He already got the permit.

990
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:33,826
Who pays for improvements
to a building being torn down?

991
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:34,827
Don't you agree?

992
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:38,707
Are you doing this
to pocket the improvement cost?

993
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,042
They're amusing.

994
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:43,294
You dirty thief!

995
01:06:43,295 --> 01:06:44,587
I'm sorry,

996
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:47,423
but do you mind excusing me? Thank you.

997
01:06:47,424 --> 01:06:49,383
Okay.

998
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:50,551
Get him out of here!

999
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:52,387
Turn that off. I get it.

1000
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:57,434
I said to turn it off, bitch!

1001
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:00,853
Your asshole nephew

1002
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:03,523
has been coming since two days ago
to redecorate.

1003
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:05,525
But what? They'll knock down the building?
Bullshit.

1004
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:08,277
Is that your building?
Do you even know how things work?

1005
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:10,905
It's up to me to decide
when to build or knock it down.

1006
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:11,949
It's mine.

1007
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,075
Do I need your permission?

1008
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:16,702
How much did you sell it
to your asshole nephew? Tell me.

1009
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:19,289
Why should I tell you, you annoying brat?

1010
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,376
Then don't.

1011
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:25,461
I'll plaster the Internet
with how you abuse the weak

1012
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:27,965
and let all the reporters know
what a son of a bitch you are.

1013
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:29,883
Hey!

1014
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:32,134
Move.

1015
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,302
What are you doing?

1016
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:36,180
- Close the door!
- Let go! Let go of me!

1017
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,058
Phone. Her cell phone.

1018
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:41,352
Get it!

1019
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:42,854
Her cell phone!

1020
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:45,065
Let go! Let go of me!

1021
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:50,987
Let go! Let go of me!

1022
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:53,532
Don't you do it.

1023
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,831
I wondered why you two were so confident.

1024
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:03,124
You had a recording?

1025
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:05,543
- Very classic.
- Let go.

1026
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:07,670
Do you think I have nothing better to do

1027
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:10,966
than deal with you schmucks
about some little restaurant?

1028
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:15,469
Do you think I'll give a damn
about whatever the hell

1029
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,055
you do with that recording?

1030
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:21,185
You lowlife beggars.

1031
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:25,731
- Do you think begging is a right?
- You son of a bitch!

1032
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:41,788
You really are Bon-jin's daughter.

1033
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:44,958
What is this?

1034
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:47,419
Do you regret it?

1035
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:50,964
I heard he tried to commit suicide.

1036
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,675
The dad commits suicide
and dies with all the debt

1037
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,385
in order to save his kids.

1038
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:58,137
The kid that never cared about him

1039
01:08:58,138 --> 01:09:00,390
regrets it now and is going ape shit.

1040
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:02,226
Seriously.

1041
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:05,187
This is touching. Very touching.

1042
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:07,772
Let's go.

1043
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,610
You prick!

1044
01:09:12,945 --> 01:09:14,529
- Let go!
- Drop it!

1045
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,405
- Let go of me!
- Drop it!

1046
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:17,865
Stay still!

1047
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:19,825
- Let go of me!
- Stay still!

1048
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:22,203
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Hey, you!

1049
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:24,997
- Hurry! Get her out of here!
- Let go of me!

1050
01:09:24,998 --> 01:09:26,749
- Stay still.
- Where is he?

1051
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,710
- Let go of me!
- Hey you, Choi Yeong-hwan!

1052
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:30,462
Hey you, Choi Yeong-hwan!

1053
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,257
Let go of me!

1054
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,592
Let go!

1055
01:09:40,973 --> 01:09:42,516
Hey you, Choi Yeong-hwan!

1056
01:09:59,616 --> 01:10:01,577
This is Korea Equipment Trading.

1057
01:10:02,244 --> 01:10:04,161
A strange man is here

1058
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:06,202
waving a knife around.
He hurt one of our employees.

1059
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,165
Yes.

1060
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,835
Yes. Please come right away.

1061
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:16,008
Gosh.

1062
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:19,261
Things are going to get annoying.

1063
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:22,680
Let's try and get along, please.

1064
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:24,516
You really shouldn't do this.

1065
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:28,812
Damn it!

1066
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:41,033
Go inside and clean up.

1067
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:45,621
Are you okay? Let me see.

1068
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:48,248
That knife is evidence,
so don't handle it.

1069
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,585
- Hey, you. Stop.
- What are you doing?

1070
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:53,753
- What is he doing?
- Stop!

1071
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:55,046
- Stop!
- What is he doing?

1072
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:56,923
- Stop him!
- Get him!

1073
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:58,383
Hey, stop!

1074
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:08,518
- You're not drunk, are you?
- No way.

1075
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:09,936
I usually drink three bottles of soju.

1076
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:12,855
Babe. It's so pretty here.

1077
01:11:12,856 --> 01:11:15,399
- Look over there.
- It's super high.

1078
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,401
- What perfect weather, too.
- Yeah.

1079
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:18,904
There aren't many cars either.

1080
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:20,780
Look.

1081
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:22,574
Gyeong-jin, look over there.

1082
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,743
Let's go over there.

1083
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:33,292
The person you have reached
is not available. Please leave a message

1084
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:34,670
after the tone.

1085
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:37,798
Shit!

1086
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:49,726
CHAIRMAN CHOI YEONG-HWAN

1087
01:11:57,818 --> 01:11:59,069
The person you have reached...

1088
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,037
You've gotten a lot better.

1089
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:11,331
Shut it.

1090
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:20,798
Hye-yeong.

1091
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:22,217
Look here.

1092
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,430
Come on, look.

1093
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:30,386
- Hye-yeong.
- Why did you come that day?

1094
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:32,638
What's going on with Bon-jin?

1095
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,267
- When I heard...
- You brought money that morning.

1096
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:37,352
Didn't you?

1097
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:40,354
- What...
- The day after the accident.

1098
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:42,815
I mean, two days
after my dad burned his arm.

1099
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:44,818
You came saying
you had planned to see Dad.

1100
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:46,987
Did Dad call you?

1101
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:49,615
Yes.

1102
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,075
What did he say?

1103
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,125
I know everything about Chairman Choi.

1104
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,127
Tell me the truth.

1105
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:09,551
He said to bring the money.
That he'd move out.

1106
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,888
Did Chairman Choi give you the money?

1107
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:17,392
- Yes.
- How much?

1108
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:23,649
Twenty million won.

1109
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,359
That son of a bitch.

1110
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:27,652
Go tell the police.

1111
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,987
Who kills himself
after making plans for the next day?

1112
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:31,822
And tell them how you were a witness.

1113
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:32,908
Hye-yeong.

1114
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,621
Is your dad brain-dead?

1115
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:39,790
Are you sure?

1116
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:50,425
Then you should stop, too.

1117
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:52,593
Stop what?

1118
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:54,720
Your family owes 500 million won.

1119
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:57,515
You and your dad can never pay that off.

1120
01:15:57,516 --> 01:15:59,810
That's why we have to get it
from that asshole.

1121
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:04,773
If that were possible,
your dad would've done it already.

1122
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:10,112
There's nothing that we can do.

1123
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:12,613
Then should we roll over and die?

1124
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,199
That's the only way you can live.

1125
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:17,828
You're trying to save your own ass!

1126
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:23,625
How could you do this, Uncle?

1127
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:26,128
Dad gave you that bulldozer.

1128
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:28,671
Dad introduced you to Auntie.

1129
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,882
I know you were a witness! I heard you!

1130
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,050
So what?

1131
01:16:36,597 --> 01:16:37,931
Bon-jin is dead.

1132
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:41,351
How will you pay his hospital bills?

1133
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:43,478
What about Hye-jeok?

1134
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:45,646
I'll take care of it.

1135
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:47,316
What could you do?

1136
01:16:48,025 --> 01:16:50,067
What have you done until now?

1137
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:52,571
What did you do
while your dad was struggling like that?

1138
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:56,449
Hey, you.
Do you think you're actually something

1139
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,410
just because you have tattoos
and act tough?

1140
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,537
Does anyone even listen to you?

1141
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:02,873
Do you think anyone listens to us?

1142
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,960
That's how everyone lives.

1143
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,130
Everyone just takes it.

1144
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:12,799
They know their place!

1145
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,561
You're the head of the household now.

1146
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:27,231
Think about your brother.

1147
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:35,531
Just this time. Okay?

1148
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,742
If you let it slide just this once,

1149
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:41,119
the chairman will look kindly on you.

1150
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:43,664
If you behave,

1151
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:46,917
he'll take care of you in the future.

1152
01:17:51,255 --> 01:17:52,297
Hye-yeong.

1153
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:55,509
Just this time.

1154
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:57,636
Please?

1155
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:06,979
Fuck off.

1156
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:14,444
We need support from someone like him
who knows the district well!

1157
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:16,821
- Choi Yeong-hwan!
- Choi Yeong-hwan!

1158
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,322
Okay.

1159
01:18:18,323 --> 01:18:19,907
I, Choi Yeong-hwan,

1160
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:23,245
have put down my roots here in Incheon
for 30 years.

1161
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:26,080
I've never once broken my promise

1162
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:28,250
and have been
"Trustworthy Choi Yeong-hwan."

1163
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:32,504
It's a little embarrassing
for me to say this myself, but...

1164
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:34,505
Hold on.

1165
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:37,758
You should boast while you can, right?

1166
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:39,135
- Yes!
- Yes!

1167
01:18:39,136 --> 01:18:41,889
I'm here because all of you
wanted me to be.

1168
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:45,683
For the eternal development of Incheon!

1169
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:48,895
I will make all of you rich!

1170
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:51,731
I will never surrender to injustice!

1171
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:54,401
That is the kind of person I will be!

1172
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:20,969
Oh, hello…

1173
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:29,727
Yes, thank you! Thank you!

1174
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:32,898
Thank you! So good to see you!

1175
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:37,110
Thank you! Thank you all!

1176
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:42,156
What do you think you're doing?

1177
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,575
Get her!

1178
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:46,119
Let go. Let go of me!

1179
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:48,287
Let go!

1180
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:49,873
- Stand still!
- Let go of me!

1181
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:02,427
Did you hear anything?

1182
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:06,431
- Here she comes.
- She's coming out. Get her picture.

1183
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:10,059
How do you know Choi Yeong-hwan?

1184
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,853
Why did you assault him?

1185
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:13,646
What is the campaign's official position?

1186
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:16,148
What are you talking about?
It's just a misunderstanding.

1187
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,067
- How do you know Choi Yeong-hwan?
- Let us through!

1188
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:20,611
- Give us a statement.
- Why did you hit him?

1189
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:22,697
- Please give us a statement.
- The election is coming up.

1190
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:24,378
- Please talk to us!
- Give us a statement!

1191
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:27,744
Shit. Those reporters are loving it.

1192
01:20:28,745 --> 01:20:31,539
But it's good to get attention, isn't it?

1193
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,749
Like hell. Moron.

1194
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,085
Just drive.

1195
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:45,095
Mr. Choi wanted to lock you up,

1196
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:48,765
but I begged him to change his mind.

1197
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:54,062
You're too young to know.

1198
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:57,441
He said he'd drop it here
for old times' sake.

1199
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:00,485
So take this,
pack your things, and move out.

1200
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,198
My gosh. Thank you for calling.

1201
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:06,825
I don't know how to thank you.

1202
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,139
HOT SOY SAUCE

1203
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:42,379
May I help you?

1204
01:22:46,717 --> 01:22:49,594
- Who is it?
- Does Choi Yeong-hwan live here?

1205
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:52,221
Yes, he does. Who is this?

1206
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:54,307
I have a delivery.

1207
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:55,976
The door is open.

1208
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:05,319
What are you here about?

1209
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:07,237
Are you visiting unit 204?

1210
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:09,656
Okay. Coming.

1211
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:13,577
Who are you?

1212
01:23:16,747 --> 01:23:19,208
Hey. Who are you?

1213
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:21,585
Who is she?

1214
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:26,006
What are you doing?

1215
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:32,595
Is that gasoline?

1216
01:23:32,596 --> 01:23:35,056
What are you doing? Stop her.

1217
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:37,183
Sir, a lighter! The lighter!

1218
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:38,519
Stop her!

1219
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:43,314
What in the world are you doing?

1220
01:23:43,315 --> 01:23:44,525
Oh my gosh.

1221
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:48,569
Call the police!

1222
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,739
Just stay out of it, son!

1223
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:54,117
Stay out of it!

1224
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:55,702
Are you out of your mind?

1225
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:59,288
- Mom. Call the police.
- Okay.

1226
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:02,708
- Let go of me! Call them now!
- Get away from her!

1227
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:05,044
Quit it! That's enough!

1228
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:06,295
Get over here!

1229
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,381
We just caught an arsonist.

1230
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:10,591
Yes. We're at...

1231
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:14,763
So... We're at 245-301 Janggi-dong.

1232
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:17,558
Hey, hey! Hey!

1233
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:31,154
- Is that her?
- Hye-yeong!

1234
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:33,657
Hey.

1235
01:24:38,704 --> 01:24:39,788
What the hell?

1236
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:42,957
- Hye-yeong!
- Nice shot.

1237
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:43,958
Let go!

1238
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:47,004
Stay still, kid.

1239
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:52,091
Let go!

1240
01:24:53,177 --> 01:24:54,178
Let go!

1241
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:57,014
Hye-yeong!

1242
01:24:57,723 --> 01:24:58,807
Hye-yeong!

1243
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:02,101
Stop it!

1244
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:03,812
- Stay still.
- Let go!

1245
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:06,273
Your brother's smart.

1246
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:09,193
You have a good brother.

1247
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:12,529
No matter how much we beat him,
he wouldn't bring you to us.

1248
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:15,574
You cowardly pricks.

1249
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:22,121
Hye-yeong!

1250
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:24,665
I hear crushing people to make sure
they can't fight back

1251
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:25,751
is your MO, you bitch.

1252
01:25:28,045 --> 01:25:30,755
Touch them again, and I'll kill you.

1253
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:31,756
Let go!

1254
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,635
Stop it!

1255
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:36,677
Hye-yeong!

1256
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:39,889
Why won't you answer me?

1257
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:41,225
You bitch.

1258
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:43,477
Hye-yeong! Let go!

1259
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:45,270
Stop it!

1260
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,591
Are you protecting your big sister?

1261
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:52,402
Move, asshole.

1262
01:25:53,153 --> 01:25:54,654
- I said to move.
- Stop it!

1263
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:56,823
- That's enough.
- Yeah, that's enough.

1264
01:25:58,158 --> 01:25:59,909
Is that good enough? Should I stop?

1265
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:01,160
That's more than enough.

1266
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:02,537
Let's go.

1267
01:26:02,538 --> 01:26:04,789
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1268
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:08,460
"Stop it! You cowardly pricks!"

1269
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,685
Hye-yeong! Get up!

1270
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,472
Jeok.

1271
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:05,392
Come here.

1272
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:26,330
Hye-jeok.

1273
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:32,878
I wanted to take care of it somehow...

1274
01:27:39,718 --> 01:27:41,178
but I'm tired now.

1275
01:27:52,564 --> 01:27:53,607
Hye-jeok.

1276
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:56,401
Dad...

1277
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:10,332
Is Dad...

1278
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:15,712
dead?

1279
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:43,782
Mom...

1280
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:48,787
told me to protect you...

1281
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:54,126
and Dad.

1282
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:01,091
What do I do?

1283
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:06,847
What am I supposed to do now?

1284
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:23,757
Punk.

1285
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:31,139
Let's go see Dad.

1286
01:30:48,782 --> 01:30:50,367
I'm Gu Bon-jin's guardian.

1287
01:31:02,921 --> 01:31:03,922
Go on.

1288
01:31:40,584 --> 01:31:43,962
Lastly, as a member of his family,
I need you to sign the consent form.

1289
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:40,935
Dad, meet Mom if you go to heaven.

1290
01:32:40,936 --> 01:32:44,480
Then let's all meet in our dreams.

1291
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:48,068
Promise me you'll come.

1292
01:33:22,936 --> 01:33:24,062
Time of death

1293
01:33:25,147 --> 01:33:26,607
is 10:02 p.m.

1294
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:28,817
My condolences.

1295
01:33:56,553 --> 01:33:57,846
You can rest now.

1297
01:39:21,211 --> 01:39:22,379
What is that?

1298
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:26,717
What are you doing at this hour?

1299
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:28,844
Stop it.

1300
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:31,346
Get out.

1301
01:39:32,389 --> 01:39:33,473
Get out.

1302
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:37,394
A payloader was stolen
from Korea Equipment Trading.

1303
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:39,771
What's a payloader?

1304
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:43,482
The thing that scoops up soil,
smashes buildings...

1305
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:45,027
Oh, a bulldozer. A bulldozer.

1306
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:48,197
Hey! Get out!

1307
01:40:14,848 --> 01:40:17,392
Pull over. 8855, pull over!

1308
01:41:30,257 --> 01:41:32,426
Location is Janggi-dong
Luxury Villa Complex.

1309
01:41:54,406 --> 01:41:57,242
Get out!

1310
01:42:00,162 --> 01:42:02,456
What... What is she doing?

1311
01:42:21,808 --> 01:42:23,893
Get out.

1312
01:42:23,894 --> 01:42:25,728
Keep the people away
and set up a roadblock.

1313
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:28,147
Set up a roadblock
and request backup. Now.

1314
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:31,817
Residents of Unit 102,
please evacuate immediately.

1315
01:42:31,818 --> 01:42:34,195
I repeat, Residents of Unit 102…

1316
01:42:34,196 --> 01:42:36,657
Come this way.
It's dangerous. Be careful.

1317
01:42:49,711 --> 01:42:50,879
What are you doing? This way.

1318
01:42:52,422 --> 01:42:54,090
- Follow protocol.
- Evacuate the area.

1319
01:42:54,091 --> 01:42:55,967
One warning shot.
Three final warnings.

1320
01:42:55,968 --> 01:42:58,053
- What... Shit.
- Make sure to avoid casualties.

1321
01:43:05,602 --> 01:43:09,939
Shut it down and get out.
If you do not, we will open fire.

1322
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:12,024
Please get out of the vehicle.

1323
01:43:12,025 --> 01:43:13,527
Stop, or we will open fire.

1324
01:43:16,029 --> 01:43:18,155
Please leave the vehicle.

1325
01:43:18,156 --> 01:43:21,534
Shut it down and get out.
If you do not, we will open fire.

1326
01:43:21,535 --> 01:43:23,286
Get out or we will shoot!

1327
01:43:23,287 --> 01:43:25,997
Please shut it down
and get out immediately.

1328
01:43:25,998 --> 01:43:27,290
This is my final warning.

1329
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:29,626
Please get out of the vehicle.

1330
01:43:31,295 --> 01:43:33,171
Turn it off and get out!

1331
01:43:33,172 --> 01:43:35,215
Shut it down and get out now!

1332
01:44:04,536 --> 01:44:07,079
Status report. Report!

1333
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:08,706
Patrol car 12, report.

1334
01:44:08,707 --> 01:44:11,084
It's stopped. We're approaching now.

1335
01:44:14,463 --> 01:44:15,672
Hurry up!

1336
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:19,217
Out of my way! Open the door!

1337
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,719
The criminal has been shot
in the arm.

1338
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,473
We're transporting her
to a medical facility now.

1339
01:44:40,781 --> 01:44:43,574
Case number 32D130128.

1340
01:44:43,575 --> 01:44:45,493
Name, Gu Hye-yeong.

1341
01:44:45,494 --> 01:44:47,120
Female, 20 years old.

1342
01:44:48,163 --> 01:44:51,582
During the 18 months in prison,
she was a model prisoner.

1343
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:53,334
Considering she shows remorse

1344
01:44:53,335 --> 01:44:56,295
and numerous civic organizations
submitted petitions on her behalf,

1345
01:44:56,296 --> 01:44:57,756
we grant her parole.

1346
01:45:19,987 --> 01:45:22,155
Are you Kim Eun-seok?

1347
01:45:28,704 --> 01:45:30,873
Yes, I am.

1348
01:45:32,124 --> 01:45:35,794
Do you remember that accident
on the World Cup Bridge

1349
01:45:36,336 --> 01:45:37,462
about a year ago?

1350
01:45:40,883 --> 01:45:44,261
Would you tell me what happened?

1351
01:45:45,512 --> 01:45:46,763
And you are?

1352
01:45:53,604 --> 01:45:55,814
I'm the daughter of the man
who died back then.

1353
01:46:19,838 --> 01:46:21,590
Hey. I...

1354
01:46:27,971 --> 01:46:29,222
It's fine.

1355
01:46:29,223 --> 01:46:31,725
I was drunk that night.

1356
01:46:32,643 --> 01:46:36,522
I took my girlfriend there
to look at the skyline.

1357
01:46:37,147 --> 01:46:41,276
I didn't see the car coming
and I tried to cross...

1358
01:46:46,156 --> 01:46:47,866
At first, I was too scared

1359
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,577
and couldn't tell anyone.

1360
01:46:51,537 --> 01:46:54,248
Not even the police or my mother.

1361
01:47:00,921 --> 01:47:01,964
I'm sorry.

1362
01:47:34,872 --> 01:47:36,915
- Bye, Hye-yeong.
- Hey!

1363
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:42,754
I'll be back late,
so order yourself dinner.

1364
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:46,674
- Okay. Later.
- Bye!

1365
01:47:46,675 --> 01:47:47,926
- Be careful!
- Okay.

1366
01:47:49,678 --> 01:47:50,929
- Will that be to stay?
- Yes.

1367
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:53,849
That will be ₩6,800.

1368
01:48:06,486 --> 01:48:08,488
The one for Gangin River Park isn't here.

1369
01:48:09,281 --> 01:48:10,324
Just a minute.

1370
01:48:12,284 --> 01:48:13,368
Three minutes.

1371
01:48:16,205 --> 01:48:17,497
You're busy today.

1372
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:19,333
I am.

1373
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:40,144
I'm Park Song-ok from Korea Insurance.
I'm in charge of special cases.

1374
01:48:40,145 --> 01:48:43,773
The payment from your father's life
insurance policy was wired to today.

1375
01:48:43,774 --> 01:48:47,777
The payment was made pursuant to
a court order

1376
01:48:47,778 --> 01:48:51,197
to pay the accounts payable for policies
held by suicide victims.

1377
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:54,742
The court order applied retroactively
to policies predating the changes...

1378
01:48:54,743 --> 01:48:57,245
KOREA INSURANCE: ₩100,670,000

1380

We apologize sincerely
for the prolonged evaluation.

1381
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:06,379
We at Korea Insurance will always be
a source of strength for you.

1382
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:07,673
Thank you.

1383
01:49:29,903 --> 01:49:31,113
It's here.

1384
01:49:32,781 --> 01:49:34,366
Hye-yeong.
