=Episode 23=

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you looking for me?

12
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,976
(Tianfu Banking House)

13
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,840
Cutting ties completely from now on,

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,600
and ending up with a tragic fate.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Okay.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,960
Thank you.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,640
You're welcome.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,240
It's what I should do.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,200
I mean,

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,719
you helped me manage the inn,

21
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,560
and find the masters.

22
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,519
Thank you.

23
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,760
I didn't really help much.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,400
No need to thank me.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,519
I just want to know

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,200
your purpose is

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,319
for doing this.

28
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,400
Speak of the right timing,

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,319
a secret history of martial world
has come to light.

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,719
- Great!
- Great!

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,984
Nothing else.

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,560
Let me share a story.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,439
What if I don't want to listen?

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,280
Are you going to force me?

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:39,920
You can...

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,000
It's simply...

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,519
Choose.

38
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,319
Unimaginably cruel.

39
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,640
Let me elaborate in detail.

40
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,200
Twenty years ago,

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,439
Saintess Shen Jiyue from the Cult
and the wealthy

42
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,840
Su Shenyan fell in love.

43
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,519
Soon after, the two people
secretly married.

44
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,280
They had a son, Su Chenche.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,599
However, the Cult's hierarch, Yuyan,

46
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,800
issued a kill order for Shen Jiyue.

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,439
In the end, Shen Jiyue was
killed by Yuyan.

48
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,479
What a pity.

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,319
Exactly.

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,759
Father!

51
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,599
Where is mother?

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,080
Why?

53
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,080
Why couldn't I defeat him?

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,719
Why?

55
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,479
Father.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,759
Your mother's body was taken.

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,759
You are to be blamed too.

58
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,400
Father!

59
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,479
Do not forget

60
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,840
that making you the master
of Twelfth Night

61
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,199
is to make you remember this.

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,639
Eradicate the Cult, kill Yuyan,

63
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,680
and avenge my mother.

64
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,319
I have it kept in mind.

65
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,319
Still not enough.

66
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,039
Remember

67
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,280
that you must

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,199
find your mother's remains

69
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,719
and bring her back to life.

70
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,159
Father!

71
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,039
Father!

72
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,280
Yuyan!

73
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,639
Filial piety with the parents gone

74
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,840
truly makes one sigh.

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
- Right.
- Truely.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,479
It makes me...

77
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,719
(I will heed your teachings,)

78
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,080
(and avenge my mother.)

79
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,480
Therefore,

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,160
you want to bring your mother
back to life?

81
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,199
I do not believe it.

82
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,279
I do not believe that this thing

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
can revive a person.

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Do not believe?

85
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,560
Then why did you do this?

86
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,319
I just

87
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,759
want to bring that person to light.

88
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,720
That mysterious person.

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,160
What is his relationship with me?

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,040
Why must you use me

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,879
to bring him out?

92
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,079
He has always appeared by your side.

93
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,839
You must have felt it, right?

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,439
(This scent of medicine
belongs to that mysterious man.)

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,959
(He's nearby.)

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You finally came.

97
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,040
(It's this scent of medicine.)
Who are you exactly?

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
I will help you get the Ice Jade Bowl.

99
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,360
If he is under the protection
of Yu Lian from the Cult

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,319
and is also your enemy,

101
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,759
and Twelfth Night Splendor
and three core ingredients are required.

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,319
If what you say is true,

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,000
then the most likely person

104
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,920
is Yuyan.

105
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,720
Is it him?

106
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,920
After the time reset,

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,360
I returned to Huichun Valley.

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,759
Firstly,

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,680
to find out his relationship
with Huichun Valley,

110
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,120
secondly,

111
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,360
to kill him to avenge my mother.

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,000
So

113
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,800
you approached me?

114
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,560
When I first went to Huichun Valley,

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,759
I was following his tracks.

116
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
But that time,

117
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,120
before I could find anything,

118
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,560
you were killed by him.

119
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
I wanted to stop it.

120
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,639
But it was too late.

121
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,560
Who are you?

122
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,920
What do you want?

123
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,959
(So, Su Chenche,)

124
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,120
(in so many cycles,)

125
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,600
(I misunderstood you.)

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,720
(It wasn't you who killed me.)

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,519
Zhili!

128
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,272
Zhili!

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,839
Zhili!

130
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,399
How are you?

131
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,639
Are you okay?

132
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,319
I'm fine.

133
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,959
I never noticed

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
at that time,

135
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,759
there was a man in black.

136
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,360
it was Yuyan.

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,319
It was him

138
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,480
who killed me twice.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
He first helped me
find these core ingredients,

140
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,879
then he killed me,

141
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,519
used my blood

142
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,800
to draw out the effects of the medicine,

143
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
and to irrigate it on
the Twelfth Night Splendor,

144
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,680
making them bloom

145
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,279
to bring back the dead.

146
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,720
So,

147
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,000
all of this makes sense.

148
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,120
However,

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,480
the rumors say

150
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,879
he is already dead.

151
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,800
It was a feigned death.

152
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
What?

153
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,959
With his status,

154
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,639
spreading news of his death

155
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,000
could get the martial artists
to lower their guard.

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,600
This way,

157
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,720
he had the opportunity

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,319
to help you get those core ingredients.

159
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,000
If it is really so,

160
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,839
those who regard him as an enemy

161
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,879
will no longer hunt for him.

162
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,879
He will have more opportunities to act.

163
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,600
Zhili, can you believe me?

164
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,759
There is another matter.

165
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,360
In the last cycle,

166
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,159
is the death of my senior

167
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,720
related to you?

168
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,120
But you

169
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
were the last person to see him.

170
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,639
The last person to see him

171
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,200
might be Yu Lian.

172
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,240
So that's how it is.

173
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,480
Why didn't you explain it to Zhili?

174
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
I thought

175
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
when all matters were settled,

176
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,519
I'd find an appropriate time

177
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,879
to speak to her.

178
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,840
In that case,

179
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,799
why not explain to her earlier?

180
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,000
As for Yu Lian,

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,039
leave him to me.

182
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,776
Wait a moment.

183
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,279
What is it now?

184
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,159
Many Cult remnants persist.

185
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,600
Upon finding them,

186
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,600
fire this signal flare.

187
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,320
People from Twelfth Night
within ten miles

188
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,279
will come to your aid.

189
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,399
So that signal flare

190
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,559
was given to him by you!

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,039
Then what?

192
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,480
You said he was killed by Yu Lian.

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,559
What happened?

194
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,519
Later on,

195
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,000
Qing Xing and I examined
Hua Jiuye's body.

196
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,840
We found that his death

197
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,720
might be related to the Cult.

198
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,279
So we went to Ye Qianqian.

199
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:00,879
From her,

200
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
we got some information.

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,919
No.

202
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,600
No!

203
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,240
No!

204
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,279
I did not fail.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
I did not fail!

206
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,240
It was you.

207
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,600
It was you all.

208
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,120
It was you all who couldn't
approve of me.

209
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,720
Let go of me!

210
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,679
Be careful!

211
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,360
So,

212
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,120
senior died
as he tried to save Ye Qianqian?

213
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,720
At first,

214
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,960
I didn't believe Ye Qianqian,
until she took out the sleeve-arrow.

215
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,600
Yu Lian's sleeve-arrow,

216
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
cause of Jiuye's death.

217
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,799
(Sleeve-arrow?)

218
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,080
It matched
the wounds on Hua Jiuye's body.

219
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,840
Then I am certain.

220
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,840
(Those wounds were from a sleeve-arrow.)

221
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,279
No wonder she helped me that time.

222
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,759
Physician Shen,

223
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,759
please come back with me.

224
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,519
What if I say no?

225
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,399
Then I am sorry.

226
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,120
Leave now.

227
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,736
You...

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
Hua Jiuye let me protect you.

229
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,639
My senior, you guys...

230
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Go, I'll explain later.

231
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,440
About my senior,

232
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,679
I misunderstood you.

233
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,240
I apologize to you.

234
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,879
No,

235
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,720
I should apologize to you.

236
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,799
I should have shared

237
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,679
the information I had with you earlier.

238
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,240
But I was too arrogant,

239
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,919
always wanting to find evidence first

240
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,399
before proving it to you.

241
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,399
I never anticipated

242
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,399
that I would hurt you again.

243
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,480
I admit,

244
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,919
the purpose of approaching you

245
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,879
was not pure.

246
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
In order to stay by your side

247
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,200
unnoticed,

248
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
I learned about your preferences,

249
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
and exploited your weaknesses.

250
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,639
I schemed everything.

251
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,799
But I never predicted

252
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,919
that I would

253
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,840
fall in love with you.

254
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,440
Zhili,

255
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,159
could you give me another chance?

256
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,080
I want to make amends.

257
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,039
I bought this at a great cost!

258
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,480
What should I do now?

259
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,600
Ma'am, let me take it for mending.

260
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,679
You can't tell
if it's mended from the inside.

261
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,879
No matter how it's mended,

262
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,440
there is a crack.

263
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,759
How can it be as good as new?

264
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,639
Oh, my.

265
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
Uncle,

266
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,600
are there really free herbs in there?

267
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,039
Mother is still waiting for me.

268
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,639
Of course.

269
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,720
Have I ever lied to you?

270
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,960
Come back.

271
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,080
Let me tell you,

272
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,320
this is all for your own good.

273
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,240
Follow them,

274
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,519
then you won't suffer.

275
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,639
You bad guy!

276
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
That's my daughter!

277
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,720
Let go!

278
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,879
- You're courting death!
- Mother!

279
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,840
If you're not my sister,

280
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,679
I might sell you too.

281
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,799
That's my daughter, let go of her!

282
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,600
- Mother!
- I will kill you!

283
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,320
Mother!

284
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,240
Mother!

285
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,279
Mother!

286
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:41,824
Go!

287
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,759
- Where's the money?
- Mother!

288
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,320
Someone is dead!

289
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
I'm quitting this deal!

290
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,039
So inconsiderate.

291
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,320
Mother!

292
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,159
I'll never trust the one who lied to me.

293
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,320
Take care of yourself, Zhili.

294
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,080
I love you.

295
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,000
Mother!

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,720
Mother, don't leave!

297
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,519
Wake up!

298
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,120
Get up and look at me!

299
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,120
Is there really no way to fix it?

300
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,879
These guards.

301
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,480
I will let them stay
in the average rooms.

302
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,639
Mr. Sun, please keep an eye on them.

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,159
Those eight elders.

304
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,919
(Premier room)
I will let them stay in premier rooms.

305
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,360
They excel at crafting toxins.

306
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,039
This is the antidote I made.

307
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,879
It can repel most of the poisons.

308
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,560
Alright.

309
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,799
As for Yuanjiang King

310
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,120
and their Grand Elder,

311
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,240
these two

312
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,879
(Luxury room)
will be in luxury rooms.

313
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,080
Leave them to me.

314
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,799
Lady Shen,

315
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,879
these two are unpredictable.

316
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,120
Can you handle it alone?

317
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,679
Don't worry, I have my ways.

318
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,559
Here they come.

319
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,120
Ma'am?

320
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,039
Act to the plan.

321
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,688
Okay.

322
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,639
They're here.

323
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,200
Gentlemen,

324
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,320
do you come to stay the night?

325
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,480
Yes.

326
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm going to make a fortune today.

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,759
Please come inside.

328
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Waiter,

329
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,480
serve the tea.

330
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:44,840
Coming.

331
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,056
Gentlemen,

332
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,039
have some tea.

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Continue your work.

334
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,720
Please take a rest.

335
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,919
I will get your room keys right now.

336
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,200
Ma'am,

337
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,679
I'll get the room keys.

338
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,279
No need, I'll be right back.

339
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,279
You're so pretty.

340
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,440
I wonder if you need a man here.

341
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,840
Stop joking.

342
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,639
We are just running an inn here.

343
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,360
Why not give it a try?

344
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,480
Dear, are you alright?

345
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,399
You want to die?

346
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,720
Hold on.

347
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,360
What's wrong?

348
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,720
Be careful.

349
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,720
Why have they drawn a sword?

350
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,440
That's too much!

351
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,720
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,360
I didn't mean to.

353
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
I wanted to discuss it with you,

354
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,360
but I couldn't bear it any longer.

355
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,240
I was talking about people
from Yuanjiang.

356
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,679
I see.

357
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,279
Then, Dear...

358
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,559
Who allowed you to call me that?

359
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:01,888
Okay, I won't.

360
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,359
Can you not send me away?

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
At least let me stay until they go.

362
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,880
I can protect you.

363
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,960
No need.

364
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,720
But now,

365
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,400
they all know my relationship with you.

366
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,759
I can't also leave.

367
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,032
How about this,

368
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,519
as a reward,

369
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,160
I can help you catch Yuyan.

370
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
I can smell his unique scent.

371
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,279
So our relationship is...

372
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,640
A partnership.

373
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:32,960
Understood.

374
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,559
Grand Elder,

375
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,119
please let me destroy this inn.

376
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,680
The innkeeper is weird.

377
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,839
That was your own mistake.

378
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,680
Who can you blame?

379
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,680
Elder,

380
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,079
even if the innkeeper is fine,

381
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,519
that man must be something.

382
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,640
The one who can

383
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,960
hurt me like this

384
