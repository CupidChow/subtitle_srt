No way.

13

You can't die.

Su Chenche!

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,960
It's the Seven Poison.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,519
Don't worry.

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560

It's no use.

20
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,040
The Seven Poison from Yuanjiang,

21
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,840
no one in the world can cure it.

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,200
Dying in your arms

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,480
leaves me no regrets.

I won't let you die.

27
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,920
Dear, you look so worried.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,519
Is it because

29
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,359
you care a lot about me?

30
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,239
You fool.

31
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,760
Why say such things at this time?

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Knowing your true feelings

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,040
before death

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,680
will leave me completely satisfied.

35
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,200
I want to see

36
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,079
you dressed in your bridal attire.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,159
But in this life,

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,199
I'm afraid it's too late.

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,560
Next...

40
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,159

00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,479
Su Chenche?

42
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,759
Su Chenche!

43
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,680
Fortunately,

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,080
there's still time.

45
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,879
I can hardly breathe, dear.

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,719
Are you alright?

47
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,039
Is there any discomfort?

48
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm fine.

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,199
These flowers?

50
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,039
This isn't Huichun Valley.

51
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,639
Why am I the one lying in bed?

52
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,800
(The time hasn't been reset this time?)

53
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,599
Dear,

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,719
we're still in Mansha Land.

55
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,280
That body had hallucinogen on it.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
You've been afflicted.

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,840
Fortunately, around here,

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,400
there are flowers that can cure it.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,919
I picked some for you.

60
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,719
Dear,

61
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,400
what did you see in the illusion?

62
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,000
I saw you crying so sadly.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,439
It really broke my heart.

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
Dear, you look so worried.

65
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,879
Is it because

66
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,479
you care a lot about me?

67
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
(The illusions created by hallucinogen)

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,360

71
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,639
(what I fear the most is your death.)

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,479
(So,)

73
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,639
(what I fear)

74
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,560
(seems to be more than just
the reset of time.)

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,039
Dear,

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,199
what's wrong?

77
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,960
Ye Qianqian

78
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,040
actually just used me to leave the Cult.

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,879
She and I...

80
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,720
It is not important.

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,199
None of these matter anymore.

82

147
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,840
leave that to me.

168
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,240
The last time you appeared together

169
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,720
was ten years ago, I suppose.

170
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,840
Young master,

171
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,639
they said

172
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,200
the Second Prince
perished on the battlefield.

173
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,759
My cousin?

174
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,840
The Princess Consort sent
a secret letter,

175
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,240
suspecting a mutiny.

176
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,120
She specially requested you
to lead the Twelfth Night to help.

177
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,320
What if I don't go?

178
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,120
For the reputation of the Twelfth Night,

179
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,639
you should make the trip.

180
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,519
Getting a bit too bold, aren't you?

181
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,840
You stay here,

182
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,000
and protect them.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,039
Rest assured, young master.

184
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,720
I will definitely keep Hua Jiuye safe.

185
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,279
The first person you should protect
is Shen Zhili.

186
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,840
Yes.

187
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,039
He has been unconscious all this time.

188
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,559
The Poison Emperor sensed
its master's breath was weak.

189
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,159
To stay alive,

190
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,440
it turned to consume
his heart and lungs.

191
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,600
If this continues,

192
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,039
his organs will be completely destroyed.

193
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,159
He will certainly die.

194
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,639
What should I do

195
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,120
to lure it out?

196
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,280
(Gold Osmanthus Toad)

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
(The Gold Osmanthus Toad is a Yang.)

198
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,200
(Yin and Yang attract each other)

199
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600
(With the blood of utmost Yin...)

200
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,720
(Breeze Inn)

201
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
Your Majesty,

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,799
Hua Jiuye is inside there.

203
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,240
No matter what,

204
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,600
you must capture him for me

205
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,360
and secure the Poison Emperor.

206
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,159
Yes.

207
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,879
Let's go.

208
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,840
Guards!

209
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,559
Yes.

210
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,840
Take him.

211
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,240
Yes.

212
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,840
And her.

213
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,000
Take her too.

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,799
Yes.

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,639
Spill it.

216
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,759
Where exactly is the Poison Emperor?

217
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,279
What Poison Emperor?

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,279
I don't know.

219
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,360
Thief.

220
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,519
Thief!

221
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,240
All Huichun Valley people are thieves!

222
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,799
Your master, Shen Tianxing,

223
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,559
stole our Yuanjiang sacred object,
the Twelfth Night Splendor.

224
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,720
Now,

225
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,240
you've stolen our Poison Emperor.

226
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,519
(Master stole
the Twelfth Night Splendor?)

227
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,440
(How is that possible?)

228
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,679
I'll say it again.

229
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,519
I don't know.

230
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,279
Take her away.

231
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,759
Senior!

232
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,440
Zhili.

233
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,240
How are you?

234
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,720
Spill it.

235
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,600
Where exactly is the Poison Emperor?

236
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,039
Do you really want to know?

237
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,559
Then you might as well kill me.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
If you can't kill me,

239
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I will kill you sooner or later.

240
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,600
I know,

241
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,039
at the moment,

242
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,799
I still can't do anything to you.

243
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,919
But

244
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,080
do you remember you once had a sister?

245
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,879
Shut up.

246
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,159
Shut up!

247
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,720
It was also in such a place...

248
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,559
Shut up!

249
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Hua Liancheng,

250
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,960
I will make you pay for this!

251
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,639
Okay then.

252
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,720
Come on.

253
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,679
Zhili.

254
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,399
Senior!

255
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,600
If you don't give me the Poison Emperor,

256
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,279
what happened back then

257
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,919
will happen again here.

258
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,480
(Senior,)

259
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,840
(I will find a way to ambush him.)

260
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,559
Your Majesty!

261
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,879
Hua Jiuye, you...

262
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,559
Your Majesty.

263
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,159
Foolish.

264
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,519
You've brought Zhili to me.

265
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,600
Would I have any more concerns?

266
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,120
Senior,

267
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
stop it.

268
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,480
Stop killing.

269
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,840
I just saved you.

270
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,519
The Poison Emperor was taken by you,
wasn't it?

271
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,279
Yes.

272
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
It had been troubling you.

273
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,519
And taking it away

274
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,600
is good for your heath.

275
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,720
The poison in me

276
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,559
can only be suppressed
by the Poison Emperor.

277
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,360
I know.

278
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,320
But I have found a way to cure it.

279
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,480
You can rest assured.

280
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,679
Senior,

281
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,679
you have asked me two questions.

282
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,320
Can I ask you one?

283
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,279
I know what you want to ask.

284
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,279
I once had a sister.

285
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
Her name is Hua Runing.

286
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,640
She was very innocent

287
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,319
and cute.

288
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,400
Shen Tianxing,

289
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,519
I can give you the seeds
of Twelfth Night Splendor,

290
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,400
but you have to promise me

291
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,960
to take good care of my children.

292
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,720
(Hua Runing, Yuanjiang Queen, young Hua Jiuye)
Hua Jiuye,

293
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,400
Hua Runing,

294
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,839
pay respects to your master!

295
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,319
Look around!

296
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,240
Yes.

297
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,160
I beg you,

298
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,839
save my children!

299
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,079
They must survive.

300
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,079
Save them!

301
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,720
Okay?

302
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Okay.

303
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,960
I promise you that.

304
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,240
Keep searching.

305
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,400
Yes.

306
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,359
The kids,

307
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,599
I'll leave them to you!

308
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,759
The queen is here!

309
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,519
Mother!

310
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,079
Mother!

311
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,000
Runing!

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,224
Please, save my sister.

313
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:01,843
Please, save my sister.

314
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,839
Please.

315
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,640
Please...
