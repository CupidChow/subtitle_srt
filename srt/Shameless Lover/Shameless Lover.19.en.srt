10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,648
=Episode 19=

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,799
Seven years ago,

12
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,119
I said I'd take the Valley
and kill Shen Tianxing.

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,600
Now,

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,679
I'm ready to...

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,799
You are now the Lord of Huichun Valley.

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,960
Master also mentioned

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,479
that you could manage Huichun Valley.

18
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,319
Did the old man teach you this too?

19
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,200
Right, I heard he's dead.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,000
Take me to see it.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,799
Let's go.

22
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,088
(Tomb of Master Shen Tianxing)

23
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,480
Master.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,480
I'm Shen Tianxing from Huichun Valley.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,560
From now on,

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,480
would you like to follow me
and learn medicine?

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,879
After learning medicine,

28
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,959
you can help more people like your mum.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,200
I do, uncle.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,040
From now on, call me Master.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,319
You're awake.

32
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,359
What's your name?

33
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,000
Are you willing to be my junior sister?

34
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,159
We've buried your mum.

35
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,680
You should get well soon,

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,759
to mourn for her.

37
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,759
The medicine is getting cold. Drink it.

38
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,919
From now on, you will take my surname.

39
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,520
Your name will be

40
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,000
Shen Zhili.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,759
How about it?

42
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,479
Master.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Just died like that.

44
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,719
Too easy on him.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
How about

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,599
I dig up his corpse,

47
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,840
and turn it into a puppet
using Yuanjiang witchcraft?

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
How does that sound?

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,919
Senior.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,759
Senior.

51
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,520
Senior, what are you doing?

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
Master specially asked me

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
to bury it when he was dying.

54
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,800
He's always been thinking about you.

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
Agarwood.

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,280
Right.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,159
Back then, you often had nightmares.

58
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,919
You couldn't sleep night after night.

59
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,280
You were gradually losing vigor.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
To cure your nightmares,

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
Master traversed mountains and rivers,

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
into the agarwood forest.

63
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,560
He fought with the wolves
for three whole days and nights.

64
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
He suffered serious injuries.

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,400
Finally he got this agarwood.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,400
You always carried it with you,

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,879
saying that
only with it could you feel at ease.

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,360
All these are pretentious actions.

69
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,000
And this?

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,599
We reached the age
to practice martial arts.

71
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,960
You were extraordinarily gifted,

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,560
not only in medicine,

73
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,000
but also in martial arts.

74
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,199
In light of your characteristics,

75
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,000
Master specifically went to
the most famous swordsmith,

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,319
to forge this sword for you.

77
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,360
For this, he was even hunted
by the Southlanders,

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,759
and nearly lost his life.

79
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,520
You saved Master with this short sword.

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,160
It was also from that time

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,480
that you became a true physician.

82
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,279
Master was your first patient.

83
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,000
Shut up.

84
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,560
Well, you are still speaking for him.

85
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,680
To me, it's more hate than grace.

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,519
Mother, Mother.

87
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,720
Sister.

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,079
Please, save my sister.

89
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:36,992
Get up.

90
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,079
I won't leave.

91
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,160
Let go of me. I won't leave.

92
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
- Let me go.
- Hurry.

93
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,480
Help!

94
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,120
Move!

95
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,279
He got our Twelfth Night Splendor seeds,

96
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,199
and promised my mother.

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,040
He should have saved my sister and me.

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,839
But he broke his promise,

99
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,480
and abandoned my sister,

100
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,720
causing her to die miserably.

101
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Wanting to wipe the slate clean?

102
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,879
Don't even think about it.

103
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,759
Senior, senior.

104
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,000
You're having a poison seizure.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,839
Senior.

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
(This time,)

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,439
(I won't let you suffer that again.)

108
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,199
(Senior,)

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,199
(You and Master are my dearest family.)

110
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,000
(I really don't want to see you
become enemies.)

111
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,199
(I'll remove your misunderstandings.)

112
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,639
(When Master returns,)

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,040
(Huichun Valley will once again
be filled with laughter and joy.)

114
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,079
You're awake.

115
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,199
My Poison Emperor.

116
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,319
I have taken it away.

117
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,480
Senior,

118
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm doing this for your good.

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,839
Drinking poison to quench thirst
is not a long-term solution.

120
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,160
Moreover, Poison Emperor has been
consuming your essence and blood.

121
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,800
However,

122
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,920
rest for three days, and you'll recover.

123
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,720
Here you are.

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,040
You have no idea.

125
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,519
Without it, I simply...

126
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,040
I get it.

127
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,000
Without it, you simply could not
have survived till today.

128
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,319
Senior, rest assured.

129
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,680
Those who have hurt you.

130
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,600
I will surely make them pay.

131
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,720
So you just listen to him.

132
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,079
Senior, Master is not your enemy.

133
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,839
The one who killed your sister

134
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,839
is someone from Yuanjiang.

135
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,040
It seems

136
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,639
you haven't let him down.

137
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,759
You always stand on his side.

138
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,279
This time,

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,040
I want you.

140
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,399
No problem.

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,704
You...

142
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,600
have agreed.

143
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,959
I'm ready for a long time.

144
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,639
You have agreed!

145
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,439
Senior.

146
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:06,959
Is everything okay now?

147
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,120
Hold on tight.

148
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,480
We finally have something to celebrate
in Huichun Valley.

149
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,279
Exactly.

150
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
That's great.

151
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,439
Is this okay?

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,439
Young Master Su, your medicine.

153
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,240
Thanks.

154
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,279
Well.

155
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,199
What's all the commotion outside?

156
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
Today is the big wedding day of
Young Master Hua Jiuye

157
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,399
and Valley Lord Shen.

158
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,120
What?

159
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,439
Young master, young master.

160
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,439
Lie down now. Take a deep breath.

161
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,920
(Everything's a mess.)

162
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,439
(No way.)

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,199

causes unbearable pain when it strikes.

Dear, you're always thinking of me.

188

189

Master, please be noted.

190
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Brother and I, we're actually...

191
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
How about this?

192
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:30,112
♪I'd like to save two hearts
from being torn apart♪

193
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:37,440
♪Break free from the chains
of right and wrong♪

194
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,720
Is that okay?

195
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:48,672
♪Hold on to it♪

196
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,679

I...

198

♪You hand in mine♪

199
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,919
(Why has this reset)

200
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,519
(gone so far astray?)

201
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,399
Young master,

202
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,919
I came as soon as I got your message.

203
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,320
What happened to you?

204
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,720
These are the Exorcism Pill
and Energy-Boosting Powder.

205
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,559
Is your sword with you?

206
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,039
Yes.

207
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,200
Young master, are you going to...

208
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,440
Is everything ready there?

209
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,600
(Blessing)
Yes, ready.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,799
Almost, I suppose.

211
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,000
Almost, almost.

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Can I hang it here?

213
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,799
(Blessing)

214
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,840
Can I hang this here?

215
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,039
The auspicious moment strikes.

216
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,399
Stop.

217
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,120
Get out of the way.

218
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,960
Young master,

219
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,279
how is your wound?

220
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:25,952
Nothing serious.

221
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,679
Come on.

222
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,440
This is...

223
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,960
Fill it up. Cheers.

224
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,840
Come on, cheers.

225
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Come on, hurry, come over.

226
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,440
It is not yet sunset.

227
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,279
How come the celebration already ended?

228
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,639
For some reason,

229
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,639
our lord suddenly announced
it was moved forward.

230
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,519
Moved forward?

231
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,039
Where are they now?

232
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,159
Over there.

233
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,919
Fill it up.

234
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,720
Hurry, fill it up.

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
Fill it to the brim.

236
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
It's full, look.

237
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,200
Come on, come on.

238
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,440
Good, bottom up.

239
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,200
Young master.

240
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,000
Zhili, you really are incredibly astute.

241
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,952
(Two hours ago)

242
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,480
Zhili,

243
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,240
you're not thinking of using me again

244
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,200
to deal with that Su, are you?

245
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,320
Senior, I swear.

246
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,279
I am definitely not using you,

247
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,279
this time.

248
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,679
Right now,

249
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,759
you certainly don't intend to marry me.

250
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,279
What on earth are you up to?

251
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,720
Senior, I wish to be your sworn sibling.

252
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,559
Sworn sibling?

253
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,080
Senior.

254
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,519
Senior.

255
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,919
Senior.

256
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,320
Do you remember when we were kids,

257
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,399
why I proposed

258
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,960
to marry you?

259
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,879
It's surely because

260
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,000
you admired me.

261
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
I was only eight years old back then.

262
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,919
How would I know about admiration?

263
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,840
Then why?

264
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Because I wanted to be your family.

265
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,159
Family.

266
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,639
After my mum passed away,

267
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,960
I, back then,

268
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,039
had no idea about my future,

269
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,799
until I met you and Master.

270
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,399
Senior,

271
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,320
although we often don't see eye to eye,

272
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,600
always fighting,

273
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
I truly feel that

274
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,399
having an elder brother

275
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,840
is such a blessing.

276
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,919
In the freezing winter,

277
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,159
we roll in the snow.

278
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,360
During the scorching summer,

279
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,000
we fish in the river.

280
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,000
On lonely nights,

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,399
we stare at the starry sky.

282
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,600
During the day,

283
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,879
we study and grow together.

284
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,360
I remember that year

285
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,919
when we fished in the river,

286
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,080
and ended up being punished by Master,
standing in the river.

287
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,879
You were crying,

288
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,159
and even got your toes pinched by crabs.

289
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
It was you, coaxing me into it.

290
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,519
But when Master came,

291
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,240
you ran away yourself,

292
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,799
leaving me to take the punishment.

293
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,039
Don't you be so heartless.

294
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,360
I did come back for you.

295
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,519
That's because I told on you to Master.

296
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,240
Well, well, you ungrateful little thing.

297
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
I wondered how Master knew it.

298
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,480
You told on me.

299
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,720
I, Hua Jiuye, believe in revenge.

300
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,519
Today,

301
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,039
I'll settle old scores
along with the new.

302
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,399
Sure.

303
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,840
Families should share blessings

304
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,639
and face difficulties as one.

305
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,440
Besides,

306
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,440
you've long deemed me as your sister,

307
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,159
haven't you?

308
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,928
Senior,

309
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,559
let's become sworn siblings.

310
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,200
From now on,

311
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,720
no matter where we are,

312
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
be it in life or death,

313
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,159
as long as there's a place for me,

314
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,320
there'll a spot for my elder brother.

315
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,600
Though we are not from the same mum,

316
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,240
our bond is even tighter.

317
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,399
We will always be

318
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,480
tightly connected

319
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,159
family.

320
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,840
Why are you hitting me?

321
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,080
What do you mean by
'there's a place for you'

322
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,679
there'll be a spot for me?

323
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,480
As siblings,

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,080
the elder brother is the bigger one.

325
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,240
Disregard the order.

326
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,039
You asked for the hit.

327
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,720
Attention.

328
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,080
Today is a big day in Huichun Valley.

329
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,759
Except for on-duty physicians,

330
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,879
everyone else takes a day off.
Get drunk!

331
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,679
Great!

332
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,440
Great!

333
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, let's all give them a toast.

334
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,240
Cheers.

335
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,600
(Hopefully, Senior can keep him.)

336
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,919
(I need to hurry to the Mingyue Palace
to get the Night Shadow Pearl.)

337
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,480
Don't move.

338
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,720
This celebration,

339
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,639
what exactly is it about?

340
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,240
It's... it's that our lord

341
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,960
and her senior become sworn siblings
ahead of schedule.

342
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,919
We are just...

343
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,840
Sworn siblings?

344
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,000
Young master, what do we do next?

345
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,320
Chase.

346
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,712
Giddyap.

347
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,960
(Zhili has left the valley.)

348
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,240
(From Hua Jiuye, she should have)

349
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,559
(got the Poison Emperor Golden Toad.)

350
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,600
(Now she's going to the tea stand
to find Young Master Xiaoye,)

351
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
(and then enter the Mingyue Palace
to get the Night Shadow Pearl.)

352
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:49,664
Zhili.

353
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,039
Zhili.

354
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,559
Zhili.

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,599
(No matter what,)

356
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,000
(I must catch the man in black
at the tea stand.)

357
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,319
(Stop him from hurting Zhili again.)

358
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,079
On what grounds should I take you
into the Mingyue Palace?

359
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,240
Your symptoms of diarrhea

360
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,359
started seven days ago.

361
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,240
Three days ago,

362
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,279
granular rashes appeared on your arm.

363
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,039
This morning,

364
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
there should be sores in your mouth.

365
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,200
You can only drink tea now, right?

366
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
How do you know?

367
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,240
Didn't expect that

368
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,960
she met Young Master Xiaoye so quickly.

369
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,839
If this continues,

370
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,359
she would soon
talk Young Master Xiaoye into it.

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,039
The one we want has not yet appeared.

372
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,640
The Mingyue Palace is a complex place.

373
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,599
It's Ji Mingyue's private territory.

374
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,839
If he...

375
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,599
follows them in immediately,

376
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,279
Then...

377
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
(Didn't expect him to follow so soon.)
