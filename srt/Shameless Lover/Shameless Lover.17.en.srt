Murder!

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,200
Hurry, go send the message.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,679
Murder!

14
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,719
- Murder!
- Someone is dead!

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,600
Someone is dead.

16
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,959
(How can there be no wounds?)

17
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,000
(The injury was on the right arm.)

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,799
(There is no smell on his body.)

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
(It was that man, he killed Du Yizhi.)

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,560
(When did he...)

21
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,280
Su Chenche,

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,560
why did you kill my brother?

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,159
Young Master Su,

24
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,000
(Du Lianshan, Head of Hengshan Sect)
My disciple had no grievances with you.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,359
Why kill him?

26
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,400
I must avenge my eldest senior!

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,359
Right, seek revenge!

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,480
Martial contests are unpredictable.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,079
Moreover,

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,120
how can you be sure

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,480
it was Young Master Su?

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,159
Exactly.

33
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,159
How could you know

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,359
- it was Young Master Su?
- Exactly.

35
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,560
Who else could it be?

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,640
I am the one who killed him.

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,000
If you want to revenge,

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,519
sure.

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,000
One by one.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,359
It wasn't him.

41
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,680
Dear,

42
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,560
it doesn't matter.

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
Leave this to me.

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,159
I will not let you suffer an injustice.

45
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,599
Lady Shen,

46
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,800
your relationship is known to all.

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,280
How can we believe you?

48
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,120
Master Du, you misunderstood it.

49
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm standing on the side of truth.

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
I have met Du Yizhi a few times.

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,439
I don't want his death to be unfair.

52
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,080
Unfair?

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,199
What do you mean by that?

54
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,639
I just examined the body.

55
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,159
Judging by the degree of rigor mortis,

56
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,240
the time of death was at least
ten hours ago.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,039
You're talking nonsense!

58
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,759
If my brother died last night,

59
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,599
who was the one competing just now?

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,240
Did you notice that just now,

61
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,479
where did he get hurt when

62
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,560
fighting Su Chenche?

63
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,719
His right arm.

64
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,840
Right.

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,639
But his right arm is not injured.

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,759
Really not.

67
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,719
How could this happen?

68
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,400
Lady Du should be well aware.

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,479
It means that

70
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,520
the person who was fighting

71
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,080
and the one lying here

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,479
are not the same person.

73
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,840
Yet even so,

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,759
how can you prove

75
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,479
it wasn't Su Chenche who killed him?

76
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,960
After all, he was the only one
who went out.

77
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,624
No,

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,919
there was also the one
impersonating your brother.

79
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,800
- Impersonating?
- Impersonation?

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
How could this be?

81
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,919
How is this possible?

82
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,240
Although your words make sense,

83
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,719
they still can't rule out

84
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,759
Twelfth Night Young Master's suspicion.

85
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,759
Master Du,

86
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,639
in that case,

87
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,800
I'll vouch with the name
of Huichun Valley.

88
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
Within three days,

89
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,159
I will give you an answer.

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
If that's the case,

91
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,680
I shall await the good news.

92
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,120
Divine Physician, please be gentle.

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,879
It hurts!

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,719
Normally, when I see

95
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,199
you bandage the young master and others,

96
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,400
you're quite gentle.

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,479
How come when it's my turn...

98
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,280
There you go.

99
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,199
Who exactly took the Ice Jade Bowl?

100
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,000
It was...

101
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,960
Eh...

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,759
I didn't see clearly either.

103
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,319
Anyway, it was a person in black.

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,439
When we were not prepared,

105
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,039
he injured us.

106
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,120
By the time I woke up,

107
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,319
the Ice Jade Bowl was gone.

108
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,400
And I ended up here.

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:16,920
Then the ones who could injure

110
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,279
you Twelfth Night experts,

111
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
are there so many of them?

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Not many.

113
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
But not few either.

114
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,319
This person is hiding in the shadows.

115
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,759
It's really hard to tell.

116
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,480
Alright, I understand.

117
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,160
About your injury,

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
I will prescribe you a dose of medicine.

119
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,079
You should get some good rest.

120
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,920
Many thanks.

121
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
Young Master,

122
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,439
does Divine Physician know
that I was faking it?

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,959
Dear.

124
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,879
Zhili,

125
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,519
thank you.

126
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,920
There's no need for thanks between us.

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,439
Are you okay?

128
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,040
I feel like you have something
on your mind

129
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,879
I'm fine.

130
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,519
I am just worried about your safety.

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,720
Senior is no longer here.

132
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
You must not get into trouble.

133
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,720
I will find it as quickly as possible,

134
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,560
the person impersonating Du Yizhi.

135
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,720
I'll get to the bottom of this matter

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,079
and clear your name.

137
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,600
But this matter is with danger.

138
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,959
I don't want you to be involved in it.

139
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,800
Su Chenche,

140
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,319
I have no way out.

141
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,319
Do you really want to investigate?

142
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Qing Xing,

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,920
let's go.

144
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,488
Oh.

145
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,720
A few days ago

146
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,879
a body was discovered behind Wumo Villa.

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
Preliminary judgment,

148
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,240
it was a disciple of Hengshan Sect.

149
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,680
However,

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
when the body was discovered,

151
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,399
it was already beyond recognition.

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,519
Impossible to determine who it was.

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,519
Do you suspect

154
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,680
that the mysterious person

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,519
pretended to be the dead one

156
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,040
and infiltrated the Hengshan Sect?

157
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,528
Yes.

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
He must have first disguised himself
as the deceased

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
and infiltrated the Hengshan Sect,

160
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,120
then at some unknown time

161
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,360
disguised as Du Yizhi,

162
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,920
intended to kill in the arena.

163
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,519
So when you were fighting with Du Yizhi,

164
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,360
did you smell anything?

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
Smell?

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,439
No.

167
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,040
(It seems that only I can smell it.)

168
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,879
(So starting from Mingyue Palace,)

169
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,639
(that mysterious person
has been following us.)

170
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,160
(If it really is him,)

171
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,519
(what is his purpose?)

172
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,839
Zhili,

173
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,879
what's wrong?

174
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,360
So you admitted to killing Du Yizhi

175
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,040
and asked to challenge
Hengshan people one by one

176
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,079
because you were sure

177
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,879
he was still using the fake identity

178
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,439
and staying in the Hengshan Sect.

179
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,959
In this Martial Arts Convention,
the Hengshan Sect

180
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,360
sent seven people in total.

181
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Excluding Du Yizhi,

182
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,839
there were six people present.

183
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,360
Therefore,

184
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,680
he must be among them.

185
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,600
Why are you so certain?

186
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,120
Firstly,

187
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,920
he was seriously injured.

188
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,519
And now, all the people

189
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,680
are all on high alert.

190
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,399
If he wanted to escape,

191
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,000
it wouldn't be so easy.

192
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,959
Secondly,

193
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,720
I have ordered the Twelfth Night

194
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,519
to secretly monitor the factions,

195
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,480
especially the Hengshan Sect.

196
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
So,

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
the most dangerous place

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,639
is the safest.

199
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,759
Given his current situation,

200
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,560
the best way

201
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,959
is to stay the way he is.

202
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,439
So he must still be in Wumo Villa.

203
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
Dear, you're truly intelligent,

204
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,000
just like your husband.

205
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,839
Zhili,

206
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,639
what's wrong?

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
It's nothing.

208
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,480
I just suddenly feel a bit stifled.

209
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,800
I want to go out for some fresh air.

210
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,680
Young master,

211
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
something is not right with her.

212
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,959
Has she noticed something?

213
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,160
After all, she has drugged you before.

214
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,680
Right now, what we should do

215
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,480
is to handle our own affairs well.

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,000
As for why she would do such a thing,

217
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,360
there must be her reasons.

218
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,759
It won't be too late to find out later.

219
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,399
Yes.

220
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,440
(Senior,)

221
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,440
(I am close to the truth.)

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,240
(Wait for me a bit longer.)

223
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,120
(Wait until I finish all this.)

224
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,360
(I will surely bring you back to life.)

225
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,080
Zhili.

226
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,559
How are you doing?

227
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,519
I am a bit worried about you.

228
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,159
I am unharmed.

229
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,320
You're going
to Du Yizhi's memorial hall, right?

230
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,120
Let's go.

231
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,559
Master Du, please accept my condolences.

232
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,360
(Currently, there are four of
the Hengshan Sect.)

233
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,919
(There should be two more.)

234
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,360
(I need to find that mysterious man
before he does)

235
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,320
(and quickly find the Ice Jade Bowl.)

236
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,480
Poor disciple...

237
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,879
I want to take a walk.

238
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,519
I'll accompany you.

239
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,840
No need.

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,919
Do not delay that matter.

241
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,639
Rest assured.

242
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,559
I won't be in danger.

243
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,600
Then don't go too far.

244
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,639
Yizhi, I hoped

245
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,799
he would bring honor to our Sect.

246
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,279
We must severely punish the murderer.

247
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,279
I believe
with so many martial artists here,

248
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
we will surely find the real murderer.

249
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,159
(The memorial tablet of Du Yizhi)

250
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,159
I hope so.

251
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,639
Sorry for your loss.

252
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,480
(It's not them.)

253
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,720
My friends, please

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,600
seek justice for my disciple.

255
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,360
Master Du,

256
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,399
we will take our leave.

257
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,080
Master Du,

258
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,559
sorry for your loss.

259
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,600
Lady Shen, thank you.

260
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,879
Regarding the murderer,

261
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,600
do you have any leads?

262
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,759
The investigation is still underway.

263
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,159
Where have those two disciples gone?

264
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,360
They went out to make purchases.

265
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,840
They should be back soon.

266
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,480
Why inquiring about them?

267
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm just asking casually.

268
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Then I won't disturb you any further.

269
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,200
(There is no that smell here either.)

270
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,159
What a pity for this child, Yizhi.

271
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,039
Have you seen Physician Shen?

272
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,559
She has left.

273
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,879
With whom? Where did she go?

274
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,200
You gave me this note?

275
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,679
Junior Ding of Hengshan asked me
to give it to you.

276
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,879
They got held up on the road.

277
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,440
Someone is injured.

278
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,919
(For details, meet us at the back)
They want your help.

279
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,720
(It's not him.)

280
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
(But...)

281
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,360
You're finally here.

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,440
(This medicinal fragrance... It's him!)

283
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,879
Who exactly are you?

284
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,440
You only need to know
that I am helping you.

285
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Helping me?

286
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,519
Why do you want to help me?

287
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,320
These are all unimportant.

288
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,080
What's important is

289
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,720
I will help you get the Ice Jade Bowl.

290
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,960
You keep saying you want to help me,

291
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,559
but you framed Su Chenche,

292
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,679
poisoned the injured ones.

293
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,279
And your poison contains Huichun Grass

294
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,240
that can only be found
in Huichun Valley.

295
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,799
This is clearly dragging me down.

296
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,840
How did you help me?

297
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,799
It seems you have done your work.

298
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,080
What do you have to do
with Huichun Valley?

299
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,480
How did you get Huichun Grass?

300
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,360
You have quite a few questions.

301
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,399
(This person is very guarded.)

302
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,679
(I won't be able to make him talk.)

303
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,039
Don't you want to cooperate with me?

304
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,440
I will not cooperate with someone

305
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,120
whom I do not understand.

306
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,799
I came here today just to confirm

307
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,879
that from Mingyue Palace to Breeze Inn

308
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,120
and then to Wumo Villa,

309
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,879
it has always been you.

310
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,720
You are smarter than I thought.

311
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,080
(Indeed, it's him.)

312
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,679
Before I finish my task,

313
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,039
don't hurt Su Chenche.

314
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,519
Otherwise, I'll make you pay.

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,879
Ice Jade Bowl,

316
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,559
I know where it is.

317
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,919
Young master,

318
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,879
I've searched the entire manor

319
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,519
but didn't find any trace of her.

320
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,120
Has she discovered something?

321
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,279
Take your men and go home,

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,039
act according to the plan.

323
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,759
Yes.

324
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,039
(There's a dark tower
ten miles outside Wumo Villa,)

325
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,919
(hidden among the woods.)

326
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,440
(It belongs to Twelfth Night)

327
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,519
(I have led the people away.)

328
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,799
(You may not believe me, but I think)

329
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,039
(you shouldn't pass up any)

330
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,840
(opportunity to find the Ice Jade Bowl.)

331
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,279
(Point the finger at the Cult,)

332
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,799
(incite martial artists to attack
and disrupt the situation,)

333
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,679
(and then attribute the disappearance
of the Ice Jade Bowl)

334
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,440
(to the mysterious one.)

335
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,440
(Turn people against each other,
and then harvest the result.)

336
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,039
(Su Chenche, so this is your game.)

337
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,879
(Not only can you get Ice Jade Bowl,)

338
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,200
(but also leave unscathed,)

339
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,200
(and even gain a good reputation.)

340
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,639
(Truly a well-played strategy.)

341
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,639
Put down the Ice Jade Bowl.

342
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,399
(Qing Xing!)

343
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,000
I just want to know

344
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,600
all that you have done,

345
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,600
is it to bring back his mother?

346
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,960
Answer me!

347
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:03,960
Yes.

348
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,360
Give me the bowl.

349
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay.

350
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,799
If you dare come any closer,

351
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,960
I will smash this bowl.

352
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
And you will never get it.

353
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,759
None of you will get it!

354
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,360
The Ice Jade Bowl is mine.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,680
Go after them!

356
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,480
With just a few of you,

357
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,759
you think you can stop me?

358
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,799
