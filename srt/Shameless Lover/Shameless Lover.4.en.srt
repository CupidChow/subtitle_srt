Su Chenche!

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,079
Dear.

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,879
Dear.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,719
Wake up, dear.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,879
We've been drugged.

16
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,640
It's a muscle relaxant powder.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,879
It'll last two hours.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,280
It must be Young Master Xiaoye.

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,000
Actually,

20
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,280
I think this is quite nice.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,200
Still, we'd better think of a solution.

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,879
Ji Mingyue will be here soon.

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
I...

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
I have the antidote on my waist.

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
But I

26
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,079
have no strength.

27
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,680
Dear.

28
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,239
They

29
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,239
have placed my hand on your waist.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,199
(How shameless.)

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,840
(Forget it.)

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,439
(There's no other way.)

33
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,159
Then you give it a try.

34
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,280
See if you can find it.

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,080
Okay.

36
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,599
What are you doing?

37
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,879
Dear.

38
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,439
My hand seems to be out of my control.

39
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,800
Bear with it for now.

40
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,719
Dear.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,000
I think I've touched a jar.

42
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,240
But

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
it fell between us.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,240
It's okay.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,560
My hand is right between us.

46
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Let me try.

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,199
Okay.

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,879
Dear.

49
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,208
You...

50
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't make that noise.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,159
I'm a physician.

52
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,759
Dear, I...

53
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,800
I have seen

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,080
and touched everything.

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,280
I'll settle the score with you later.

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,039
Dear, you've regained your strength?

57
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,632
I...

58
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,439
I have got the medicine bottle,

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,759
but I can't lift it up now.

60
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,800
Go inform the master.

61
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,439
They are coming.

62
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,680
I think I have recovered.

63
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,879
Is it this one?

64
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,159
This is it.

65
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,759
There's only one detoxifying pill.

66
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,599
You eat it.

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,159
(Wait.)

68
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
(Why would I put him
in the first place?)

69
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,080
You...

70
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,439
Did you forget?

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm supposed to be here.

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,599
Someone is coming.

73
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,400
Dear.

74
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,240
Go find the secret chamber.

75
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,000
Right here.

76
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,680
Where is he?

77
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,360
Master.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,959
Every word I said is true.

79
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,000
You must believe me.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,399
Master.

81
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,519
What happened to me?

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Guards.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,879
Yes.

84
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,680
Take him down.

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,240
Yes.

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,079
Master!

87
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,279
Please spare me, Master!

88
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,160
Please, Master!

89
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,959
Master!

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,759
Don't worry.

91
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,120
Just rest here.

92
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,439
What is this smell?

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,279
(Oh no.)

94
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,480
(Su Chenche is in danger.)

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,319

96
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,199
Dear.

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,279
I couldn't help you.

99
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,519

if there are red rashes on your wrists.

196
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,200
In a little while,

197
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,039
they should appear on your face too.

198
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,559
Mirror!

199
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,159
Young master.

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Once this poison

201
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
takes effect,

202
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,799
it starts with red rashes,

203
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,440
then the skin begins to fester,

204
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,000
and eventually, you die.

205
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,440
Waiter!

206
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,840
Stop calling.

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,679
I was the one who poisoned it.

208
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,200
Just before you came,

209
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,480
I had already secretly

210
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,399
poisoned the food in the back kitchen.

211
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,559
What do you want?

212
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,200
Only one thing.

213
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,440
I just wish to serve you,
Young Master Xiaoye.

214
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Where are you?

215
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,039
Come out.

216
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,679
Shen Tianxing is dead.

217
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Shen Zhili just left with
Twelfth Night Young Master.

218
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,639
I really came at the right time.

219
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,320
Su Chenche.

220
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,720
You left with another woman?

221
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,832
(Mingyue Palace)

222
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,039
Master.

223
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,120
What should I do?

224
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
It's just a flower.

225
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,080
Don't take it to heart.

226
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,519
But it was a gift from you, Master.

227
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,279
It is more important than my life.

228
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,600
Nonsense.

229
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
How can a flower compare to your life?

230
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,759
I'll pick you another one later.

231
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,200
Really?

232
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,559
You will pick another flower
for me, Master?

233
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,360
Haven't I always kept my promise?

234
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,720
I will pick one for you right now.

235
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
If you're not feeling well,
don't just stand there.

236
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,679
Master, I'll be waiting here for you.

237
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,080
Let's do it.

238
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,360
The poison in you
requires two antidotes.

239
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,799
This is one of them.

240
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,840
If he is safe when I come out,

241
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
I will give you the other one.

242
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,360
What...

243
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,399
What are you doing?

244
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,519
There are many traps
in the secret chamber.

245
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,799
Getting hurt will be painful.

246
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,879
The pain doesn't matter.

247
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,120
Life is what matters.

248
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,440
That's why you need this even more.

249
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,879
But your life is more valuable.

250
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,440
Can you two stop?

251
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,679
Anyway, you must protect yourself.

252
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,960
I'll be back shortly.

253
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,080
Take care then.

254
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,519
(It seems she only treasures)

255
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,879
(my life.)

256
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,000
(Since that woman
cares so much about him,)

257
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,919
(I can use it against her.)

258
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,240
The Palace Master won't be back soon.

259
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,799
Just wait here.

260
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,240
This smell.

261
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,679
Why does it smell strange?

262
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,440
