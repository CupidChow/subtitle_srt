=Shameless Lover=

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,648
=Episode 31=

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,039
What are you doing?

12
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,159
I was raised on various poisons.

13
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,479
My blood

14
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,880
can neutralize all poisons.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,640
So, last time in the inn,

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,840
you used your blood

17
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,079
to help suppress the poison?

18
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,680
Unfortunately,
you were too deeply poisoned.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,879
It couldn't be cured at once.

20
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,200
But that's okay.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,760
Just do it several more times.

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,879
Your poison

23
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,799
can then be cured.

24
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,239
Why are you being so kind to me?

25
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,799
Because

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,799
I promised to do three things for you.

27
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,719
This is the third one.

28
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,959
Is that all?

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,799
Then what do you hope for?

30
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,640
I hope that...

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,840
The reason is not important.

32
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,200
What's important, I've fallen for you.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,680
Who says it's not important?

34
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,680
You are the first person
I've ever fallen for.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,560
Your wound.

36
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,280
What's there to fear?

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,159
I have you.

38
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,919
Dear,

39
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,319
tomorrow, you and Qing Xing
guard the Ice Jade Bowl.

40
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,159
Leave the arena to me.

41
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:33,919
Okay.

42
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,599
Physician Shen,

43
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,080
we've locked on the four
great sorcerer of the Cult.

44
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,400
The final is about to start.

45
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,280
(Su Chenche,)

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
(You must return safely.)

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,000
The Martial Arts Convention's final duel
officially begins.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,360
The one leading our upright factions

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,240
to encircle and attack the Cult

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,159
will be either Hengshan Sect's Ding Wuya

51
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,879
or Su Chenche,
Twelfth Night Young Master.

52
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,280
At that time,

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,120
The Ice Jade Bowl

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,520
will belong to

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,159
the victor.

56
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,520
Good!

57
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,479
I announce,

58
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,000
the competition officially begins.

59
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,360
(His moves are different from before,
why?)

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,240
Cover up your nose!
Protect the Ice Jade Bowl.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
Is the four great sorcerers.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,319
Kill this traitor of the Cult!

63
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,000
Kill her!

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
(According to the plan,)

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,439
(Twelfth Night has pinpointed
the four great sorcerers.)

66
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,719
(Outside the Wumo Villa,)

67
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,000
(they should've been handled.)

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
(Why are they here?)

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280
(What went wrong?)

70
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,199
Who exactly are you?

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,920
Young Master Su,

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,959
what is this?

73
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,000
The match rules state
to stop at the first touch.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Do you want to take Wuya's life?

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,839
Master Du,

76
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,759
be patient.

77
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,160
The real Ding Wuya

78
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,639
is right here.

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,120
Let go!

80
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,000
I can walk by myself!

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,959
This...

82
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,519
How can there be two Wuya?

83
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,240
Exactly.

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,639
How come he looks just like me?

85
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,720
Who is this person?

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,439
Exactly.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,439
Yu Lian?

88
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,360
Yu Lian?

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,000
Yu Lian, who is this?

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
The Right Guardian of the Cult.

91
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,879
The Cult?

92
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,399
I did not know you're here,

93
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,480
please forgive me.

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,240
You have been fooled by them.

95
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm sorry!

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,120
You should be.

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
You almost ruined my grand plan.

98
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,319
However,

99
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,000
you can make amends.

100
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,000
The final
of the Martial Arts Convention,

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
you go in my stead.

102
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,240
I will certainly give it my all.

103
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,839
For you, anything.

104
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,720
So, I used your own scheme against you,

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
catching you off-guard.

106
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,600
Fighting with my hierarch?

107
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,240
You are still far from being a match.

108
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,000
(This is bad.)

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000
- What happened?
- What happened?

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
- Don't know.
- Why did he leave?

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Keep an eye on him.

112
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,959
How come he left too?

113
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,639
Yeah.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,199
(It's the scent.)

115
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,240
(The one coming is Yuyan.)

116
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,199
(Then Su Chenche...)

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,639
(Must not let him get Ice Jade Bowl.)

118
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,240
(This is a special drug)

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
(that Master gave me.)

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,040
(It can make people
temporarily lose consciousness.)

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,800
(Master,)

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
(may your spirit in heaven)

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
(help me.)

124
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,279
How could it be?

125
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,920
This thing is of no use to me.

126
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,360
Such a familiar voice.

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,639
Give me the Ice Jade Bowl.

128
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,560
Who are you exactly?

129
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,240
Silly girl.

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,959
Can't even recognize my voice?

131
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,639
From now on,

132
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,000
you shall take my surname.

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,160
I name you

134
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,240
Shen Zhili.

135
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
How does that sound?

136
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,920
Don't think

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,240
that you, disguised as my master

138
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,439
can deceive me.

139
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,120
The Twelfth Night Splendor
I entrusted to you,

140
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,759
do you carry it with you?

141
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,360
(Looks can be changed,)

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,199
(voices can be altered,)

143
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,759
(but the tone of speaking)

144
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,800
(is hard to mimic so closely.)

145
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,399
Are you really my master?

146
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,759
Impossible.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,839
My master has already passed away.

148
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,879
Impossible.

149
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
Zhili!

150
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,039
Zhili!

151
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,519
Want to know why?

152
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,240
Follow me and you will understand.

153
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,080
Master,

154
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,159
is it really you?

155
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,240
Girl,

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,039
do you remember your birthday?

157
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,639
It was in the Yin year,
Yin month, Yin day, at the Yin hour.

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
(It turns out)

159
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,639
(ever since you took me in,)

160
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,519
(I am now caught in your scheme.)

161
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,279
(Master...)

162
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,919
Hierarch, hurry away!

163
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,960
Zhili!

164
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,399
Zhili!

165
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,919
Go!

166
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,519
Your

167
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,120
antidote...

168
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm already cured.

169
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,799
It seems

170
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
you

171
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
no longer need me.

172
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,399
You're awake.

173
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,639
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,039
I really didn't want you

175
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,000
to see him that way.

176
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,200
But I...

177
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,759
You've known that Yuyan is him,

178
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,080
right?

179
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
I've been looking for a chance
to tell you.

180
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,200
But I didn't know how.

181
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,039
I know.

182
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,279
You were afraid that I

183
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,080
wouldn't be able to accept it,

184
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,480
even more afraid I'll be mired in pain

185
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
and can't get out.

186
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,039
In fact,

187
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,720
during these few hours,

188
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,840
I thought about many things.

189
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Once upon a time,

190
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,960
in order to bring him back,

191
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I worked so hard to find
the three core ingredients.

192
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
But...

193
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,559
Before,

194
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,679
all my hope and motivation

195
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,279
were to save my master,

196
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,639
and suddenly,

197
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,200
everything changed.

198
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,120
My perseverance

199
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,600
became meaningless,

200
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,679
even ridiculous.

201
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,480
Zhili,

202
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,559
no matter where you want to go,

203
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,759
I will always be with you,

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,399
even if we go through another time loop.

205
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,159
No.

206
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,519
Not even after a thousand times,

207
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,679
ten thousand times,

208
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,600
the outcome will be the same.

209
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,039
I know.

210
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,840
I must

211
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,080
accept this truth.

212
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,960
Zhili,

213
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,000
with me,

214
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,799
you don't have to be so strong.

215
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
After this battle,

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,960
two of the four great sorcerers died,

217
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
two have fled.

218
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,679
The Right Guardian, Yu Lian, died.

219
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,759
We've suffered
over a thousand casualties.

220
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,679
The Cult's power has waned.

221
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
But

222
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,799
Yuyan has not yet been captured.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,320
Therefore,

224
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,480
no matter what,

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,240
I have an unshirkable duty.

226
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,279
Everyone,

227
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,799
what are your plans?

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,919
Here,

229
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm in for sure.

230
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,159
The true location of the Cult
is not easy to find.

231
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,559
And it's full of traps.

232
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,600
Without me leading the way,

233
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,480
you probably won't even
find the entrance.

234
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay.

235
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,200
To avoid unnecessary sacrifices,

236
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,639
let's send a few people to scout first.

237
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,759
It's just that

238
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,080
one person must stay behind

239
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,000
to care for Zhili.

240
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,120
Dear.

241
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,679
Dear.

242
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,480
Why are you here?

243
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,360
I want to go.

244
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Why?

245
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,919
I want to find out

246
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,399
why he did all this.

247
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,840
What it was all for.

248
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,440
This is the small town that leads
to the Cult's cave.

249
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,639
Young master,

250
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,399
our main forces

251
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,360
have been stationed ten miles away,

252
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,159
ready to move on our scout's signal.

253
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,559
The house up ahead is the entrance.

254
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,559
These people were taken by force.

255
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,399
The doctrine of the Cult,

256
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,480
everyone has a demon inside.

257
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
They capture ordinary people
to refine them,

258
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,919
thinking they are helping them

259
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,320
to face their true nature.

260
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Ultimately,

261
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,279
these people have become

262
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,039
walking corpses with evil in hearts.

263
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,200
Awaken the demon in your heart,

264
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,759
thereby controlling you.

265
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,759
This is indeed Shen Tianxing's doing.

266
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,279
Fine leather.

267
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,679
Do you want leather?

268
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,639
Don't touch them.

269
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,120
Zhili,

270
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,639
you and Su Chenche go in first.

271
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,639
We'll hold them off here.

272
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Then be careful.

273
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,480
Remember our agreement.

274
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,399
Don't be credulous.

275
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,519
Don't be soft-hearted.

276
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,360
Don't look back.

277
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,320
See you in a bit.

278
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,279
(We walked through that door together.)

279
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,679
(Why am I in Huichun Valley?)

280
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,000
(Where did Su Chenche go?)

281
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,759
Here it comes.

282
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
Your favorite hibiscus cake.

283
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,360
Come on, eat it while it's hot.

284
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,960
This scene,

285
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,679
I played it in my mind countless times.

286
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,039
But I never imagined

287
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,480
the master I have always missed,

288
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,120
now

289
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,440
would meet me in this way.

290
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,399
Zhili,

291
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,600
am I not just the same as before?

292
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,200
What?

293
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,159
Do you dislike me for being a bit old?

294
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,399
Don't you want me anymore?

295
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,480
Su Chenche,

296
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,200
where is he?

297
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,640
You,

298
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,960
why did you do this?

299
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,799
When you're little,

300
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,480
you always pestered me saying

301
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,839
that you'd never marry.

302
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,559
Wherever I go,

303
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,200
you would go there too.

304
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,160
Having you chatter beside me every day

305
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,920
made me feel that time flies.

306
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,079
Later on, we gained some fame.

307
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,880
So I treated patients every day,

308
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
grew some vegetables.

309
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
I just felt

310
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,640
satisfied.

311
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,359
So satisfied that I gradually forgot

312
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,519
why I hid myself here.

313
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,480
You have been frail since childhood.

314
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,759
A gust of wind would make you cough.

315
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
Today it was my oversight.

316
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,160
Back at that snowy night,
with the charcoal fire lit,

317
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,880
I wrapped you in a fox fur
and told you stories.

318
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,960
You

319
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,799
ended up falling asleep right away.

320
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,599
Yes, indeed.

321
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,640
You had old wounds at that time.

322
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,880
Pain in the rainy night
was often unbearable.

323
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,759
I found the herbs

324
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,880
to relieve your pain.

325
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,079
You praised me
for making rapid progress.

326
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,240
At that moment,

327
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,599
I finally felt

328
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,039
the significance of being a healer.
