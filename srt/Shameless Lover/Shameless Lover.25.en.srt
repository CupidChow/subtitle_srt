10

=Episode 25=

11
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,920
I have placed 281 types of poisons
in this Yuanjiang.

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,799
How did you make it into my Mansha Land?

13
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,640
I have a Poison Emperor in me.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,200
And he

15
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,280
has your specially made

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,239
Poison-proof Pill.

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,280
So you have

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,879
the Poison Emperor.

19
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,719
Then you must be

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,840
Hua Jiuye's junior sister

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Shen Zhili.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,359
Correct.

23
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,680
Disciple of Shen Tianxing.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,040
Then you must be carrying

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,439
Twelfth Night Splendor's seeds.

26
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
Master and disciple share the same root,

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,200
all thieves.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,560
You are quite good at pointing fingers.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,879
Speaking of thieves,

30
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,120
aren't you

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,200
the greatest thief?

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,599
The principle of 'winner takes all'

33
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,120
isn't alien to you guys

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,400
from the Central Plain?

35
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,759
I heard that
once the old thief Shen Tianxing died,

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,039
you carried the Twelfth Night Splendor
with you again.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
I'm afraid you are still unaware of
the legend of Twelfth Night Splendor

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,639
in our Yuanjiang Royal Family.

39
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,280
What do you mean?

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,479
Two drops of blood.

41
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,560
Twin flowers.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,439
Yin and Yang seeds
turn into Yin and Yang.

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,159
With Yin and Yang ready,

44
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,159
things transform,

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,759
resulting in birth.

46
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,120
Yin and Yang shift,

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
towards the cycle of birth.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,360
What does this mean?

49
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,520
This is naturally for you
to figure it out on your own.

50
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll take your life.

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,759
Hua Liancheng.

52
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,808
(Hua Lianchi, Hua Jiuye's father)

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,879
Royal brother!

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,224
It can't be.

55
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,080
He's dead.

56
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,439
Who are you?

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,680
When we just entered here,

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
I placed a mirage poison on him.

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,240
Now the poison starts to work.

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,479
This person is evil.

61
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,360
But he fears

62
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,960
his royal brother the most.

63
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,080
That's Hua Jiuye's father.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Liancheng.

65
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,759
For a mere throne,

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,159
you exterminated my entire family.

67
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,120
How cruel you are.

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,599
I took such good care of you
when you were a kid.

69
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,680
You've greatly disappointed me,

70
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,400
and broken my heart.

71
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
You can't just blame me.

72
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,360
I do have the talent for governance.

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,319
But our father,

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
he didn't even give me a chance
to compete for the throne.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,800
You should blame our father.

76
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,599
Nice speech.

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Aren't you just for
getting the Poison Emperor?

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
I've been frail since childhood.

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,479
I need it.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,840
Liancheng.

81
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,439
I have said

82
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,519
that once I ascend the throne,

83
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
I will give you the Poison Emperor.

84
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,399
I will also find you the best physicians
in the world.

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,120
Why are you so impatient?

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
Can't you just wait for me

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,000
to arrange everything properly?

88
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
What did you say?

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,800
I didn't know.

90
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,120
I thought
my royal brother would abandon me.

91
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,720
I...

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,519
I thought...

93
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,160
So because of your conjecture,

94
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,000
you killed me,

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
your sister-in-law,

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
your niece,

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
and hundreds of lives
from the royal palace.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
Royal brother, I was wrong.

99
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,399
It's my fault.

100
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,360
Please forgive me.

101
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,560
Royal brother.

102
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,399
Royal brother.

103
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,160
Where did you

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,680
bury our remains?

105
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,959
At

106
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,079
Mount Suoluo.

107
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,680
Come in.

108
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,959
Senior,

109
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,399
heading to Mount Suoluo tomorrow?

110
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,680
After so many years,

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,560
I finally found them.

112
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,720
I

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,279
never had the chance to give it to you.

114
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,319
Consider it a farewell gift.

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,199
As we part,

116
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,079
take care.

117
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,519
Only you are still foolishly persisting.

118
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,399
Twelfth Night Splendor

119
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,000
is from Yuanjiang.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,199
Do you know its use?

121
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,920
Don't you already know it?

122
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,680
What about you?

123
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,759
Going to
the Martial Arts Convention?

124
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,120
That guy is going with you, huh?

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,160
It seems that guy

126
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,360
still has some true feelings for you.

127
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,839
But you seem to have some reservations.

128
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,560
Well,

129
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,600
did he bully you?

130
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,160
I knew it.

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,319
Then I'll fix him

132
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360

134
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,199
Don't want me to do it?

135
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,560
So

136
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,120
you still care about him.

194
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,600
Things transform.

195
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,919
Two drops of blood.

196
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,320
Twin flowers.

197
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,399
Yin and Yang seeds
turn into Yin and Yang.

198
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,480
With Yin and Yang ready,

199
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,559
things transform.

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,399
Resulting in birth.

201
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,559
Yin and Yang shift,

202
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,320
towards the cycle of birth.

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,039
What does this mean?

204
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,879
I have consulted many classics.

205
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,840
No records.

206
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,759
Look.

207
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,360
Your seed is red.

208
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,720
Mine is black.

209
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,679
So this color is
to distinguish Yin and Yang.

210
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,159
Two drops of blood.

211
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,120
Twin flowers.

212
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,399
Yin and Yang seeds
turn into Yin and Yang.

213
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,679
Dear,

214
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,799
do you still remember

215
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,840
our first reset?

216
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,559
Who are you?

217
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,120
What do you want?

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,399
(So)

219
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,200
(it's our blood)

220
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,440
(dripping on these two seeds
simultaneously.)

221
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,799
(That started the time reset.)

222
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,519
Yin and Yang.

223
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,639
Could it be
that your body is extreme Yang?

224
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,559
So it is.

225
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,519
No wonder your wounds

226
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,759
always heal so quickly.

227
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,559
In that case,

228
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,279
the first half of this proverb

229
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,159
makes sense now.

230
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,919
But the second half is still unclear.

231
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:33,559
(The Yin and Yang proverb)

232
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,519
Perhaps the essence
lies in the second half.

233
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,039
But what exactly does it mean?

234
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,120
We still need to dig into it.

235
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,759
It's getting late today.

236
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,120
Let's rest first.

237
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,080
Have some.

238
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,840
You too.

239
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,416
(Guangju Hall)

240
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,039
Qing Xing.

241
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,399
Why are you here alone?

242
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,519
Where are the others?

243
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,080
Sun and Li have already left,

244
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,279
asked me to say goodbye.

245
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,759
Young Master Hua also left.

246
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,960
He said to give you this.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,080
(Letters live.)

248
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
(Just skip the farewells.)

249
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
(Bye for now.)

250
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,759
So the young master has left as well?

251
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,759
He...

252
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,759
You'd better be quiet.
