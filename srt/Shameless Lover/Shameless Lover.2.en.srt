124
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,639

that I love you

126
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,800

155
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,200
You should have said so earlier.

156

If I were to put you down now,

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,159

159
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,039
It is said that only when

161
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,120

167
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,519
Just like in the legends.

168

Somebody's coming. Let's go.

169
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,919
The palace master of Mingyue Palace,
Ji Mingyue

170
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,200
has a fascination with men.

171
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,960
He has a new set
of playthings every month.

172
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,360
Look.

173
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,120
(Xiaoye, Young Master of Mingyue Palace)
That Xiaoye is one of them today.

174
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,080
We can follow him and sneak in later.

175
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,759
Okay.

176
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,360
Right.

177
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,919
Women are forbidden in Mingyue Palace.

178
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,200
We have to disguise ourselves
as brothers, okay?

179
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,399
Yes, dear.

180
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,639
Brother.

181
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,000
I've only known him for a few days.

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,320
How could I possibly let him know

183
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,559
something so important?

184
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,159
Luckily, he is an obedient dimwit.

185
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,600
I shook him off with just a few words.

186
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,840
Where is the Night Shadow Pearl?

187
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,759
Searching aimlessly

188
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,080
is like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

189
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,679
I must think of a way.

190
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,399
Where are you from?

191
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,279
Who sent you here and
what is your purpose?

192
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,559
You'd better come clean.

193
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,639
We have plenty of ways to torture you.

194
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,720
He was captured?

195
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm asking you a question.

196
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,879
How dare you

197
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,080
be so disrespectful?

198
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,136
(Ji Mingyue, Master of Mingyue Palace)

199
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,600
Master.

200
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Master.

201
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,080
My brother and I are servants
of young master Xiaoye.

202
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,519
We are not familiar with Mingyue Palace
and have offended you.

203
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,960
Please forgive us, master.

204
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,879
There is a new group who arrived today.

205
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,120
But I have not seen you before.

206
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:22,919
Guards.

207
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,440
Yes.

208
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,720
I have not seen

209
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
such a handsome
young man in a long time.

210
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
You can stay.

211
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,840
I don't want to.

212
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
Yes, he will.

213
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,759
Mingyue Palace never forces anyone.

214
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,720
I will make him come to me willingly.

215
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,519
Master, rest assured.

216
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,279
My brother will be yours
sooner or later.

217
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,080
Take care on your way.

218
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,320
(I was trying to find an excuse)

219
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,039
(to stay and search for
the Night Shadow Pearl.)

220
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,720
(I didn't expect Ji Mingyue
to fancy him.)

221
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,039
(That saved me trouble.)

222
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,960
Is this woman

223
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,120
thinking of betraying me?

224
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,120
Brother.

225
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,168
Dear.

226
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,840
Dear, what's wrong?

227
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,039
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm so sorry.

229
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,039
I should never have brought you here.

230
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,000
Then you wouldn't
have ended up like this.

231
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,200
No.

232
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,320
I have to protect you.

233
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,279
Take the chance and escape.

234
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,360
I won't leave.

235
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,360
If I leave, what about you?

236
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,240
Although you always call me Dear,

237
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,200
although you've said

238
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
that you would help me
no matter what I do,

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
it's okay.

240
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,879
Don't worry about

241
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,000
what will happen to me after you escape.

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
And don't worry

243
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,919
if I can get out alive

244
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,159
to see you.

245
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,600
In any case,

246
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,039
you'd better go now.

247
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,279
I know you're doing this for my sake.

248
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,200
But I want to be with you forever.

249
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,399
I will not live alone.

250
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,720
Even if

251
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,600
you have to reluctantly
be her plaything?

252
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,399
I will do it for you.

253
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,720
(At this point,)

254
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,159
(there is no other way.)

255
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,200
(I must go along with it and see.)

256
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,440
(So,)

257
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
(this is your purpose.)

258
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,559
(I can only play along for now.)

259
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:33,888
(Mingyue Palace)

260
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,480
You didn't tell me

261
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,879
that I'd have to do this.

262
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,440
I didn't know, either.

263
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,279
Ji Mingyue has gathered such a crowd.

264
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,159
This may well be
a good opportunity to approach her.

265
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,679
You must take this chance.

266
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,879
If you can

267
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,159
gain her favor exclusively,

268
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,960
it might be helpful to me.

269
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,519
Alright then.

270
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,400
Master.

271
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
Everything is ready.

272
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
Now that the gifts are here,

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,839
get out, the rest of you.

274
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,000
Young master.

275
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,960
Behave yourself.

276
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,480
Remember the three prohibitions.

277
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,759
I'll come to get you when I'm done.

278
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,559
Enough.

279
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,960
Tonight, I am destined to prevail.

280
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
The Palace Master will surely keep me.

281
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,039
That's not easy.

282
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,119
(An unknown newcomer.)

283
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,160
(I must outshine him today
no matter what.)

284
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,359
Although everyone is a young master,

285
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,599
it's your performance that decides

286
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,480
whether you can stay.

287
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,400
Stand in your place.

288
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,119
