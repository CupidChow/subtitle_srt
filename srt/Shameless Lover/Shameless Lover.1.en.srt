=Episode 1=

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,079
This time,

12
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,920
you still want to kill me.

13
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:13,498
(Three months ago)

14
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:18,432
(Huichun Valley)

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,312
Huichun Valley

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,519
(Shen Zhili, Lord of Huichun Valley)
(Master, god bless.)

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,200
(From your belongings,)

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,480
(I found the seeds of
the Twelfth Night Splendor.)

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,840
(You once told me)

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,599
(that the Twelfth Night Splendor
can bring the dead back to life.)

21
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,959
(It just requires the aid
of Night Shadow Pearl,)

22
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,920
(Gold Osmanthus Toad,
and the Ice Jade Bowl.)

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,439
(Rest assured, no matter how difficult,)

24
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,159
(I will find these medicines)

25
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,400
(and bring you back to life.)

26
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,239
Dear physicians.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,959
My lord.

28
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,760
My lord.

29
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,239
It's been days
since the late Lord passed away.

30
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,799
Thank you all for your care.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Now I need to leave for a few days.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
I have to leave Huichun Valley

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,599
to all of you.

34
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,919
Rest assured, my lord.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
My lord, there's someone outside
seeking medical help.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,960
We have many physicians here.

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,919
Find them whoever's available.

38
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,800
But they specifically asked for you.

39
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,039
I am Qing Xing.

40
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,759
(Qing Xing, Twelfth Night Master)
Please save my young master.

41
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,240
Who is your young master?

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,400
Twelfth Night Young Master, Su Chenche.

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,159
Twelfth Night Young Master

44
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,479
who is admired by all
in the martial world?

45
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,280
Yes.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,199
Please help him.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,439
He looks healthy and energetic to me.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,599
He's fine.

49
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,439
I have urgent matters to attend to.
If needed,

50
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,159
I can ask a physician from the Valley

51
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,240
to examine you further.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Please come inside.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,599
Stop there.

54
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,319
It's the rules of Huichun Valley

55
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,319
that we do not save those
who enter the Valley without permission.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
You enter the Valley and
coerce a physician with swords.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,840
Are you sure you want to do this?

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,199
My apologies, Physician Shen.

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,919
It was my subordinates' fault.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,560
But still, I implore you
to treat me personally.

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,439
Any physician

62
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,479
in Huichun Valley can treat your injury.

63
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,159
There's no need for me.

64
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,319
I'll take my leave.

65
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,280
Physician Shen, don't go.

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,856
Young master.

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
What's wrong?

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Are you okay?

69
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,680
Young master!

70
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
Our young master is dead!

71
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,560
(How could it be?)

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Young master!

73
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,800
Young master, wake up!

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,439
(There was nothing wrong
when I took his pulse.)

75
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,592
Young master, please!

76
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,719
- Young master!
- (What is going on?)

77
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,680
Young master, please wake up.

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Young master!

79
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,480
Why do I feel a bit dizzy?

80
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,920
My lord!

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,000
My lord, wake up.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,920
How is the Lord?

83
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:29,839
(Two hours ago)

84
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,680
My lord.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,879
(What's going on?)

86
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,519
(Why is this happening?)

87
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:44,992
My lord.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,639
The Twelfth Night Young Master, right?

89
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,079
Okay, I can treat him.

90
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,199
Please come inside.

91
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,399
A divine physician indeed.

92
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,079
Bring him over.

93
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,759
What do you want to say?

94
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,680
I know the rules of Huichun Valley.

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,439
(It is a generous offering.)

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
(Since I cannot leave,)

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,360
(it's better to wait and
see how things unfold.)

98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,439
(This money)

99
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,639
(will be of great help
to Jiyang Hospital.)

100
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,879
I wonder how many days
it will take for him to recover.

101
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,360
He can be cured immediately.

102
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,879
(He is indeed a handsome young man.)

103
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,199
(Those rumors are not false.)

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,519
(This is the last step.)

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,759
Physician, our young master...

106
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,480
Our young master's injury
isn't that severe, is it?

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
He's been in there for six hours.

108
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,279
Your young master's sword wound
seems severe,

109
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,639
but he's not affected by it greatly.

110
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,439
Very interesting.

111
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,519
(Young master, you are
really harsh on yourself.)

112
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,800
Physician Shen,
why hasn't he woken up yet?

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,639
You said he could be cured immediately.

114
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,160
What does that mean?

115
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Are you questioning my medical skills?

116
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,160
After half an hour,

117
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,319
if he doesn't come to,
you can question me.

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,639
I certainly didn't mean to question you.

119
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,600
I'll give you some more banknotes.

120
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,680
This is a one hundred tael banknote.

121
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,480
Dear.

122
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,560
What did you call me?

123
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,920
Dear.

124
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,720
How dare you!

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,720
Dear.

126
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,800
That

127
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,079
isn't right, is it?

128
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,319
Young master.

129
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,040
This couldn't possibly
be your plan, could it?

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,759
(Twelfth Night)
Physician Shen's information is here.

131
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,560
Young master,

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,279
can we really find the person

133
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,560
by doing this?

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,704
(Personal information of Shen Zhili)

135
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,199
As long as we follow her,

136
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,240
that person will show up.

137
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,319
(Shen Zhili, this time I will
keep a close eye on you.)

138
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,480
How about this?

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,319
I'll refund half the treatment fee.

140
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,360
No.

141
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll refund it all then, alright?

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,319
No.

143
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,439
The men of the Twelfth Night

144
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,959
have camped near the Huichun Valley.

145
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,839
If we don't see the young master cured,

146
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,839
we won't leave.

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,240
Are you threatening me?

148
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,240
If even you

149
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,800
cannot save our young master,

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,240
no one in this world can.

151
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,160
(If word gets out,)

152
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,959
(it will harm the reputation
of Huichun Valley.)

153
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
(This must be settled quickly)

154
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,199
(so that I can set off
to find the medicinal herbs.)

155
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,736
Dear.

156
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,360
Let go of me.

157
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,240
No, dear.

158
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,039
Apart from the treatment fee,

159
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,600
I'll also give you
some money for cooperation.

160
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,159
How much?

161
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,480
Holding hands...

162
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,360
Ten taels.

163
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,879
Master Qing.

164
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,919
Do I look like someone who can be swayed

165
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,440
by money?

166
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,279
Ten thousand taels.

167
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,759
Wh-What did you say?

168
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,480
Holding hands,

169
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,600
ten thousand taels.

170
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,360
(That'll surely keep you.)

171
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,679
Deal.

172
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,639
I went through so many medical books

173
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,720
but still didn't find

174
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,440
a case similar to Su Chenche.

175
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,840
What should I do?

176
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,840
Dear.

177
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,879
It's been a whole night.

178
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,000
I miss you so much.

179
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,039
You need to pay for hand-holding.

180
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,840
I miss you too.

181
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,519
Dear, this is for you.

182
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,159
Then you can lean on me a bit longer.

183
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,399
Drink it up.

184
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,559
Good boy.

185
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
This isn't for you.

186
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
There's more.

187
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,600
(It seems his symptoms)

188
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
(can't be solved shortly.)

189
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,360
(It can't be delayed any longer.)

190
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,639
(Tonight I must use my finishing move.)

191
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,559
Dear.

192
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,840
Are you trying to cure me

193
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,279
or kill me?

194
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,039
What do you think?

195
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,279
It seems

196
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,480
you are quite eager.

197
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,600
Dear.

198
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,679
You're trying to murder
your own husband?

199
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,519
Of course not.

200
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,799
(This should work.)

201
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,240
I can't wait any longer.

202
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
I must leave now.

203
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,200
Everyone, last night,

204
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,000
they had such a passionate time

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,159
that the bed even collapsed.

206
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,279
Physician Shen,

207
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,480
I never thought you'd be the type

208
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,200
who doesn't take responsibilities.

209
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,639
What are you talking about?

210
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,919
Come with me and see.

211
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,960
Let me go.

212
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,840
Why are you putting on

213
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,399
this miserable performance?

214
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,120
What is this for?

215
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,639
You must take responsibility
for my young master.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't you have work to do?

217
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,960
My chastity is gone.

218
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,639
Why should I dwell in this world?

219
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,320
Young master.

220
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,799
Don't do anything foolish.

221
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,039
Fine, I'll take responsibility.

222
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,600
Does that make you happy?

223
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,519
Stop this.

224
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,440
Come back with me.

225
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,600
The Twelfth Night Young Master
is a passionate lover.

226
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,159
(Everyone has a plan up their sleeve.)

227
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,080
(I shall run away now.)

228
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,480
Our young master died!

229
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
(It can't be.)

230
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,559
(What exactly went wrong?)

231
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:32,736
(A day ago)

232
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,600
Dear.

233
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,559
Dear.

234
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,240
(Here we go again.)

235
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,559
(What exactly went wrong?)

236
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,320
Our young master died!

237
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,352
My lord!

238
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,159
Greetings, my lord.

239
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,240
Don't die, young master.

240
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,200
Young master!

241
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,720
Physician Shen, our young master died!

242
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,480
(Every time he dies,)

243
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,799
(time will reset?)

244
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,960
(I have to confirm it.)

245
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,799
Dear, it's time to take your medicine.

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,519
(If my guess is wrong,)

247
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,919
(wouldn't I be murdering him?)

248
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,320
Wait.

249
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,879
It's gotten a bit cold.

250
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,080
I'll go warm it up for you.

251
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,120
It's okay.

252
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,519
How could I waste

253
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,679
my dear wife's kind intentions?

254
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,639
Su Chenche!

255
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Dear.

256
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,360
The medicine...

257
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,000
Su Chenche...

258
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,320
Su Chenche.

259
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,879
Su Chenche!

260
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
Nothing happened to me this time.

261
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,679
Qing Xing.

262
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,240
(As expected.)

263
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,240
(Since I can't get rid of him,)

264
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,879
(I might take him with me.)

265
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
That's all, right?

266
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,080
I am not going out with you.

267
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,639
Why not?

268
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,279
My wound has not yet healed.

269
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,399
How can I go for a trip?

270
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,360
You tricked me into going out

271
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,399
just to abandon me.

272
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,159
Dear.

273
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,559
You misunderstand me.

274
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,360
I am so sad.

275
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,240
I just want

276
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,039
to take you out for a trip.

277
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,559
We can stop by

278
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,919
at the Mingyue Palace.

279
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,919
Perhaps we can find

280
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,559
a cure for your amnesia.

281
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,960
Since you don't want to go,

282
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,519
then I'll go by myself.

283
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,080
You care about me so much.

284
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,000
Does it mean

285
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,039
you really love me?

286
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,879
I do.

287
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,840
I do love you.

288
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,519
Really?

289
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,639
Of course.

290
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,000
If you don't believe me, I can swear...

291
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,279
Swearing won't do.

292
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,320
You must demonstrate it with your heart.

293
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,840
So,

294
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,559
on this journey,

295
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,720
I'll see how you perform.

296
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,480
Right.

297
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,799
I will perform well.

298
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,399
During our trip,

299
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,240
I will make the accounts
with no omissions.

300
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Rest assured.

301
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
I will be honest.

302
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,399
Go see if we've packed all we need.

303
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,920
I have something to attend to
before leaving.

304
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
I will be back in a moment.

305
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,160
Keep this secure.

306
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,720
It's not needed anymore.
