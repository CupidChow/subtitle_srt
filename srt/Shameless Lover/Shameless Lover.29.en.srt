=Shameless Lover=

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,648
=Episode 29=

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,560
To my knowledge,

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,399
Even with the medicine he could only
temporarily hold his breath,

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,679
after the effect wears off,

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,920
he wouldn't still have a pulse.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,000
Could it be

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,840
he has truly mastered Breath Holding?

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,759
This skill has long been lost.

18
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,039
But I heard there's
medicine in Western Regions,

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,960
after using,

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,560
one can feign death for twelve days.

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,240
After that,
the person would have no pulse.

22
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,159
And there would be a strange fragrance.

23
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,400
But ordinary people

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
cannot smell it.

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,319
That's right.

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,120
Yuyan has this unusual scent on him.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,400
It's like sandalwood or clove.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,719
It's quite peculiar.

29
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,560
But this medicine

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,319
has also been lost for long time.

31
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,719
Why?

32
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,840
Are the ingredients hard to find?

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
No.

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,439
Huichun Valley has an herb
known as Huichun Grass.

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,959
It's just that

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,959
its ingredients and purification process

37
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,920
are relatively complex.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,480
(It's the Huichun Grass again.)

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,680
(This time
I've investigated Huichun Valley)

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,480
(inside and out,)

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,359
(still haven't found the Cult's spy.)

42
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,079
(How did the Cult)

43
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,359
(get Huichun Grass?)

44
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,159
(I must first get close to Yu Lian)

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,719
(and search for clues.)

46
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:50,432
(Puji Hall.)

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,439
(Last time I encountered Yu Lian)

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
(was right here in this medicine shop.)

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
Sir, two ounces of dried tangerine peel,

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,159
and some Chuanxiong and Xiangfu.

51
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,359
I'm really sorry,

52
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,200
we've out of Xiangfu.

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,840
This place is far from the city,

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,520
the medicine you mentioned
is not commonly available here.

55
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,280
However, we do have another herb

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,560
called Hongsharen,

57
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,080
whose effect is same as Xiangfu.

58
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,039
(Surely this time,)

59
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,360
(he must be nearby.)

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,919
Hey, do you have Xiangfu?

61
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,120
Sorry, miss, it is all sold out.

62
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,680
This place is far from the city.

63
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,520
The herb you just mentioned
are not commonly found here.

64
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,159
However, we do have another herb

65
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,840
called Hongsharen,

66
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,319
whose effect is same as Xiangfu.

67
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,479
We're fellow on the same path.

68
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,360
Pleased to meet you.

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,159
Pleased to meet you.

70
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,479
Are you a local?

71
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,960
I wonder if

72
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,360
we could exchange knowledge on medicine?

73
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,919
Didn't expect
Shen Zhili to be so enthusiastic.

74
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,680
This indeed saves me a lot of trouble.

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
Then how about today?

76
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,479
I wonder if you are willing

77
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,479
to visit the Herbal Hut.

78
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,120
Please lead the way.

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,759
Please.

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,360
I presume you're
well-versed in medicine.

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,199
I wonder

82
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,159
if you've heard of Huichun Grass.

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,360
Huichun Grass?

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
That is an herb found in Huichun Valley.

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,639
Its medicinal properties are unique.

86
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,759
It is both a poison and an antidote.

87
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,159
It's just a pity.

88
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,159
I have never been to Huichun Valley,

89
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,520
nor have I ever seen it.

90
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,159
(He doesn't seem)

91
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,319
(to know the Cult)

92
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
(can get the Huichun Grass.)

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,360
(If that's the case,)

94
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,680
(Huichun Grass was obtained
by Yuyan himself.)

95
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,719
That is truly strange.

96
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
As the Right Guardian of the Cult,

97
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,120
even such a small wish

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,199
cannot be fulfilled.

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
You are smarter than I thought.

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
It's just a pity.

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,960
You still haven't seen
through Su Chenche.

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
If you have something to say,

103
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,479
just say it outright.

104
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,280
Back then,

105
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Shen Jiyue betrayed our hierarch

106
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
and eloped with Su Shenyan.

107
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,759
And soon after, she had Su Chenche.

108
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,919
Surely my hierarch
can't let them get away.

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
Master Yuyan searched for four years,

110
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,920
finally found their hiding place.

111
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,759
Lady Shen, you're intelligent.

112
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,120
It should not be hard to see

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,360
He approaches you

114
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,519
for getting the core ingredients.

115
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,480
So he can revive his mother.

116
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,600
No, he wouldn't deceive me.

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
What is the truth after all,

118
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,160
Lady Shen, you can find out by yourself.

119
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,759
I will be waiting here.

120
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
Dear,

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
I saw you ate very little at dinner.

122
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,959
Is something troubling you?

123
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,480
I was just thinking

124
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,439
what kind of magic does Yuyan have

125
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,800
to be able to disrupt
the entire martial world,

126
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,759
and even get us involved.

127
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,680
This person,

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,639
regarding martial arts skills,

129
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,920
or wisdom,

130
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
is almost at the pinnacle.

131
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,759
Upon his takeover, the Cult expanded

132
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,079
day by day.

133
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,160
It's just a pity,

134
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
he is cruel by nature,

135
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
using all his talent

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,519
for evil deeds.

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,319
There is still one thing.

138
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,920
Just how did Yuyan get his hands on

139
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
the unique herbs of our Huichun Valley,

140
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,160
the Huichun Grass?

141
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,720
I once suspected there were spies

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
in the Huichun Valley,

143
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,639
but both the result of my investigation

144
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,120
and Yu Lian's reaction

145
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
made me feel

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
the Cult were not involved.

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
But the Huichun Grass,

148
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
only Master, my senior

149
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,879
and I could have access to it.

150
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,839
Master has already passed away.

151
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,319
Senior couldn't possibly...

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
And it's even more impossible for me.

153
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,759
Zhili,

154
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,279
I've long pondered something.

155
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,959
I feel

156
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,120
I should tell you.

157
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,000
Actually,

158
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,680
Your master

159
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,800
and Yuyan, actually...

160
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,680
My master knew Yuyan?

161
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,279
That's not right.

162
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,560
Master was such an upright person.

163
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,879
How could he possibly know that demon?

164
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,560
Unless he was bewitched by him.

165
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,800
What did you just say?

166
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,680
Young master.

167
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Come in.

168
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,959
Young Master Hua asked me
to hand him to Physician Shen.

169
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,879
Du Yizhi?

170
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,519
It seems

171
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,120
your senior made a move earlier.

172
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,040
But this is good.

173
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Originally, Du Yizhi

174
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,279
was to represent the Hengshan Sect.

175
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,720
Now that he has fainted.

176
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,319
This matter is considered resolved.

177
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,800
But what should we do

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
to let the fake Ding Wuya

179
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,959
replace Du Yizhi in the competition?

180
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,879
This way, you can expose it in public,

181
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,720
the true face of the fake Ding Wuya.

182
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,439
It looks like

183
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,600
we need to pay a visit to Hengshan Sect.

184
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,319
Dad, please have Physician Shen
save my brother!

185
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,600
Master Du,

186
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,560
Du Yizhi has a heart condition.

187
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,160
Recently,
for the Martial Arts Convention,

188
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,920
he intensified his training.

189
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,199
This has led to
poor circulation of blood,

190
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,759
resulting in his unconsciousness.

191
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,079
What should we do now?

192
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,079
I was counting on him

193
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,040
to win glory for our Hengshan Sect.

194
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Master Du,

195
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,560
for his sake,

196
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
I suggest that you

197
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,360
should reassign another disciple.

198
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,120
After all,
there will be other opportunities.

199
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,696
Don't sacrifice the big for the small.

200
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Xiaoxiao,

201
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,079
go fetch Wuya.

202
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,040
Yes.

203
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,560
Please excuse me.

204
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,959
(I'm sorry, Master Du.)

205
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,279
(Only by letting
the fake Ding Wuya fight)

206
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,160
(can Du Yizhi avoid the disaster)

207
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
(and not suffer.)

208
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,639
Dear, what great acting skills.

209
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,079
Even I almost believed that Du Yizhi

210
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,720
fainted due to excessive practice.

211
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,639
You are even better.

212
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,279
Master Du believed you

213
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,600
and agreed right away.

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
It seems that

215
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,720
we are truly a match made in heaven.

216
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,919
But our actions

217
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,679
are clearly "evil".

218
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
Zhili,

219
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
What have I done?

220
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,519
Why do you treat me like this?

221
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,440
You're overthinking it.

222
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,759
I'm just a bit tired.

223
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,879
I'll go back.

224
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,679
What do you mean?

225
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,559
What do you mean by that?

226
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,240
Physician Shen, Young Master Su.

227
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,559

228
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,080

Don't worry, he won't follow.

Why?

232
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,360
We just had an argument.

233
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,759
Isn't it just to prove

Because the thunder's roar

305
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,919
reminds me of the cold

306

thunderstorm nights have
not only cold and fear,

311
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,159
they can also have light

312
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,879

313
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,159

it's time to settle that last account.

358

Let's go.

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,160
It's temporarily suppressed.

385
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,920
I'll leave the rest to you.

386
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,519
What do you mean "leave the rest to me"?

387
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,799
You're the physician.

388
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,960
