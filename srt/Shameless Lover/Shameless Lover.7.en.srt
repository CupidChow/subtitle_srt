=Episode 7=

11
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,200
Master!

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,200
Master.

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,040
I wanted to avoid this wedding.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,079
Why did it turn out this way?

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Young Master Xiaoye!

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,159
For her,

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,120
I might just be one of the many men.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,439
But for me,

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
she is my only love.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,719
If it weren't for her,

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,680
I would have been dead

22
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,040
a year ago.

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,519
I owe her

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,799
my life.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,000
So it can only belong to her.

26
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,120
Why do you carry me again?

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
Because

28
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,400
I don't want to leave you ever again.

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,199
Why are you still carrying me?

30
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,360
I'm not injured.

31
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,960
You should have said so earlier.

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,479
If I were to put you down now,

33
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,919
it would be quite
an embarrassment for me.

34
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,879
Just now in the cave,

35
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
he helped me.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,319
It turned out

37
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
Young Master Xiaoye is so devoted.

38
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,599
He gave up his flesh and blood

39
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,319
to meet his love in the netherworld.

40
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,759
If it were you,

41
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,400
I would do the same thing.

42
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,560
You...

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,199
Oh.

44
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,439
You...

45
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,919
You're a bit heavy.

46
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,759
I'm heavy?

47
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,280
You think I'm heavy?

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,319
Just a bit.

49
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,479
What?

50
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,120
Hey.

51
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,680
Su Chenche, you stop right there.

52
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,752
(Nanluan Town)

53
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,319
(Breeze Inn)

54
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,120
Cakes.

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
Pearls.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,159
Look.

57
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:11,919
(Breeze Inn)

58
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,719
We're here.

59
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:17,888
(Breeze Inn)

60
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,399
Welcome, dear guests.

61
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,199
Come inside.

62
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,399
Are you two here for a meal

63
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,279
or staying for a night?

64
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,920
We're staying.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,600
I see.

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,920
I'll take you upstairs to see the rooms.

67
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
Come this way, please.

68
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,199
This way.

69
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,639
Over here.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
Right here.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,079
How do you two like it?

72
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,439
We'll have two rooms.

73
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,519
This is the only one left.

74
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,519
Can you two make do together?

75
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,000
I can give you a discount.

76
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,439
How would that work?

77
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,560
Let's go. We'll find another inn.

78
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,879
It's okay.

79
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,959
We'll take this room.

80
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,199
Then I won't disturb you any further.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
Thank you.

82
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,319
Dear!

83
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,279
What are you doing?

84
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,079
I paid for it,

85
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,720
so I'm the one staying.

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,639
Then where will I stay?

87
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,399
The innkeeper will take care of you.

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Master.

89
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,319
Did you see your demeanor?

90
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,199
Of course she'd see through it.

91
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,199
It can't be my fault.

92
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,920
Practice again.

93
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,360
(Now I need the Gold Osmanthus Toad
and the Ice Jade Bowl.)

94
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,480
(Master.)

95
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,079
(I will surely revive you.)

96
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,319
The survivors in the Mingyue Palace

97
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,800
have also left the valley.

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,120
I kept guard there

99
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,519
and didn't see anything unusual.

100
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,839
Go confirm again

101
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,839
if Xiaoye is dead.

102
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,680
Xiaoye.

103
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,079
Are you suspecting...

104
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,519
He is very cunning.

105
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,839
The closer the person,

106
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,959
the more vigilant I must be.

107
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,879
I understand.

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,399
Go on with your duties.

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,000
Is there anything else?

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,439
This was sent by your aunt.

111
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,079
She also has a message for you,

112
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,800
saying you should celebrate
at least one of the two festivals.

113
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,279
If you don't like
celebrating your birthday,

114
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,680
then celebrate
the Mid-Autumn Festival instead.

115
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
You are here loafing around

116
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:19,584
(Young Su Chenche)

117
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:20,800
instead of practicing?

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Father,

119
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
it is the Mid-Autumn Festival today,

120
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,199
and also my birthday.

121
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
I want to...

122
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,319
You mother couldn't rest in peace.

123
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,680
Yet you want to have fun?

124
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,279
Go back to your practice.

125
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,000
Get out!

126
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,199
You take it.

127
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,000
But...

128
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,680
Take it away.

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Why are you here?

130
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,000
This is my inn.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,519
I have responsibility for my guests.

132
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,040
Come, let me see your hand.

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,920
It's a minor injury.

134
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Don't worry about it.

135
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,759
It's a big scar.

136
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,920
When will it heal?

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,079
It seems

138
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,720
I have to come and
change your dressing every day.

139
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,920
I am a physician myself.

140
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,279
You need not trouble yourself.

141
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,879
Don't be so courteous with me.

142
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,319
Thank you.

143
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,199
Dear, you made these?

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,279
Every year during
the Mid-Autumn festival,

145
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,480
I would sew one for my master

146
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,879
and senior brother each.

147
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,040
I've gotten used to it.

148
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,720
Then this year,

149
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,000
would you sew one

150
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,600
for me?

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,800
We only give gifts on birthdays, right?

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,600
Today is my birthday.

153
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,279
It doesn't matter.

154
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,279
Your hand still hurts.

155
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,040
I understand.

156
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,160
Your blessing is enough for me.

157
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,360
Happy birthday.

158
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
You're here too, Master.

159
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,919
Miss Shen,

160
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,279
our owner said

161
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,519
that no matter what festival it is,

162
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,360
you must prepare a gift
for your beloved.

163
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
He went through the entire street

164
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,480
to get these for you.

165
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,080
Dear.

166
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,759
I need to check the accounts.

167
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,639
I have to go.

168
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,039
Oh.

169
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,759
Remember to eat these.

170
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,679
Today is his birthday.

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,279
I add too much water.

172
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,279
I'll add some more flour.

173
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,120
But too much flour now.

174
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,200
(More water then.)

175
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
(There's not enough time)

176
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
(to prepare a decent gift.)

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,559
(I can make him a longevity peach)

178
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,000
(or a bowl of longevity noodles.)

179
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,360
Qing Xing.

180
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,159
Come.

181
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,600
Physician Shen.

182
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,639
How does your young master
usually celebrate his birthday?

183
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,320
My young master's birthday

184
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival.

185
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:48,200
But he has never truly
celebrated a birthday.

186
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Why is that?

187
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,440
You might not be aware.

188
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
After the young master's mother
passed away,

189
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,840
his father changed completely.

190
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,679
He missed the Madam so much

191
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,879
that he took to drinking

192
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,559
and was prone to sudden fits of rage.

193
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:02,159
He was especially harsh
on the young master

194
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,320
either by scolding

195
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,679
or by whipping.

196
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,840
My young master has many scars.

197
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,000
The Mid-Autumn Festival,

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,759
which is also his birthday,

199
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,159
has become a nightmare for him.

200
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,000
He has such a miserable past.

201
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,080
Are you bringing me here

202
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,440
to celebrate my birthday?

203
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,639
But...

204
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,000
This pretty one is too expensive.

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,519
The cheap ones aren't pretty.

206
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
Guanyue Tower has launched a challenge.

207
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Whoever passes the challenge

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,039
can eat and drink as they please.

209
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,592
Really?

210
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:47,639
And the best painter in the whole city

211
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,919
is painting portraits in the tower.

212
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,440
Let's hurry.

213
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,320
Hurry up.

214
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,159
Should we go too?

215
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,200
It's there.

216
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Alright.

217
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

218
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,759
our Guanyue Tower is
hosting a challenge today.

219
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,039
(Owner of Guanyue Tower)
Those who pass may enter our tower

220
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,919
and enjoy the wine without charge.

221
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,519
Plus, the city's best painter
will paint for you.

222
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,000
(Guanyue Tower)
There are seven floors in Guanyue Tower.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Therefore, the challenge
has seven levels.

224
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,200
Among them,

225
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,519
the challenge on the top floor
is the most difficult.

226
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
Will any of you take on it?

227
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,360
So,

228
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
we aren't looking for the cheap ones

229
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,080
but the free ones?

230
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
Rest assured.

231
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,320
Now you can enjoy the Mid-Autumn Moon,

232
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,039
drink to celebrate a birthday,

233
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,200
and have someone paint for you too.

234
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
Isn't that perfect?

235
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
Mister.

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,320
He wants to challenge the seventh floor.

237
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Miss,

238
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,759
my tower is known
as a dating spot for couples.

239
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,360
So this challenge

240
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
must be completed by a couple.

241
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,960
Then you'll have to join me.

242
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
It's all free, isn't it?

243
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,200
Okay.

244
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,799
We're in.

245
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,759
Good.

246
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,159
The challenge on the seventh floor

247
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,480
is simple to explain.

248
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,159
One person drinks a cup of
my ancestral strong liquor,

249
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,559
Wenxiangzui.

250
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,360
The other person

251
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,320
uses a bow and arrow

252
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,600
to hit the center of the copper coin
hanging on the door.

253
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,159
That counts as a success.

254
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,879
This liquor can get
an ordinary person drunk

255
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,440
just by smelling it.

256
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,399
Which of you will drink it?

257
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,919
Then I'll have to drink it.

258
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,639
But I don't know archery.

259
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,399
I'll teach you.

260
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,279
Take a deep breath.

261
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,080
Relax.

262
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Aim at the copper coin.

263
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,919
Brilliant!

264
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,279
It's a hit.

265
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,480
That's amazing.

266
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,600
Mister.

267
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,759
May we go upstairs?

268
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
Certainly.

269
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,399
Please come in.

270
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,159
Bravo!

271
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,879
Bravo!

272
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,639
Do you want some sobering-up pills?

273
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,360
I can hold my liquor very well.

274
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,759
Hey,

275
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,080
what do you think Chang'e is doing now?

276
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,519
Is she waiting for Hou Yi?

277
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,960
On the festival of reunion,

278
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,639
she must feel very lonely.

279
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,600
Hey...

280
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
I thought you could
hold your liquor well.

281
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,519
Su Chenche.

282
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,519
Happy birthday.

283
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,799
Thank you, dear.

284
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,399
I am truly happy today.

285
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,159
Finally, I have someone celebrating
the Mid-Autumn Festival

286
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,080
and my birthday with me.

287
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
But I haven't done much for you.

288
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,639
Your company is enough.

289
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,279

Why did you bring this?

309
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,120
This is the birthday gift you gave me.

310
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,159
I must carry it with me all the time.

311

I need to buy some things.

312
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,240

What do you have to buy?

314
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,279
I'll pay for it.

315
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,440
No need.

316
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I just need to buy some things
for our trip to Yuanjiang.

317
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,279
Yuanjiang?

318
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,960

Of course not.

321

I'll take you with me this time.

322
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:09,879
Oh.

323
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,879
Can you speak the Yuanjiang dialect?

324

Yes.
