00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,600
(This is Hallucination Pill. With fire,
its scent can cause hallucinations.)

12
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,159
(Looks like
the Hallucination Pill starts to work.)

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,640
You've known some for over a decade,

14
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
but it seems you've just met.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,000
You've known some merely days,

16
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,840
but it seems
you've undergone many together.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,159
So you know her well.

18
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,400
Then tell me.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,079
What is she doing now?

20
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,159
It's been on Ji Mingyue's mind
for more than ten years.

21
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,920
Removing it in just one night

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,120
is no easy task.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,400
Master,

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
do you

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,519
still remember me?

26
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,519
You.

27
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,400
Aren't you...

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,599
Who is it again?

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
Then, do you remember Su Shenyan?

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
I do.

31
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,799
He is the one who cares only about me.

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Be careful.

33
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,159
Look.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,599
So beautiful.

35
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,640
They're all in full bloom.

36
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,280
Shenyan.

37
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,400
Shenyan.

38
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,439
No.

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,120
Not possible.

40
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,199
Not possible.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,919
What is this?

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,400
Not possible.

43
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm so pretty.

44
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,159
And I love him so much.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,159
How could he possibly not like me?

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,599
To love someone,

47
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,199
learn to love yourself first.

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,759
If you don't even love yourself,

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,240
how can you expect others to love you?

50
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,599
I?

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,240
I don't love myself?

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
I am Ji Mingyue.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,960
The entire Mingyue Palace is mine.

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
Those handsome men in the world.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,639
I can have as many as I want,

56
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,919
in whatever way I like.

57
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,240
How dare you

58
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,520
Judge me here?

59
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,599
Is that real?

60
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,159
But when I look at
this vast Mingyue Palace,

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,759
it's not the Peach Garden of love,

62
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,400
but a cage of self-admiration,

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
where you escape from the reality.

64
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,039
It's the abyss you've created for men.

65
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,120
Cage.

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,479
No. Living in such an abyss...

67
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,080
Abyss.

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Are you truly happy?

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,919
Zhili,

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,599
here you are.

71
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,919
Then,

72
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,199
why not let it go?

73
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,199
Let it go.

74
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,199
Just like your pair of thumb rings.

75
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,159
Put them down.

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,120
Maybe then you'll find

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,199
the one

78
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,599
who truly loves you.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,159
Zhili, look.

80
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,400
So beautiful.

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
Think about it.

82
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,560
All sweet memories

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,479
are merely your fantasy.

84
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,159
The person you love

85
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,000
has never loved you.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,280
All are illusions of your fantasy.

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,879
Stop deceiving yourself.

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,439
Let it go.

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Let it go.

90
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,839
Let it go.

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,079
(Both the jade toggles are here.)

92
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,000
(Su Chenche did not swap them.)

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will let go of them all.

94
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,399
Master.

95
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,519
Pass on the Master's decree.

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
(Mingyue Palace)
Mingyue Palace is disbanded right away.

97
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,879
Let's go.

98
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,600
You are...

99
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,079
Mingyue Palace is disbanded right away.

100
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,959
All the young masters may return home.

101
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
The master has moved on
from that person.

102
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,936
Her mental burden is gone.

103
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,160
Mingyue Palace will henceforth
return to normal.

104
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
We can go home now.

105
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Let's go.

106
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
Let's go.

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,519
Then congratulations.

108
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,759
Although it's not easy,

109
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,600
I believe,

110
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,120
having me, the one who is fully
in tune with her, by her side,

111
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,399
nothing is impossible.

112
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,399
Is it you and her fully in tune,

113
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,519
or me and her as soul mates?

114
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,639
It's still too early to tell.

115
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,399
He didn't say much
in the Huichun Valley.

116
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,136
He didn't tell her anything either
in Mingyue Palace.

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,720
Obviously, she's not expected
to be too involved,

118
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,480
especially in the upcoming encounter
with people from Yuanjiang.

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,680
Send him away.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,399
Yes.

121
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,480
Zhili.

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,120
Your senior is no longer here.

123
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,839

Lady Shen,

171
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,600
to book our entire inn,

172
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,879
it costs fifty taels of silver.

173
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,159

May I know the surname of your owner?

177
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,840
Well, this...

178
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,279
I don't like
to take advantage of others.

179
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,679
Here is a hundred taels.

180
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,159
Take it

181
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,080
and clean up the rooms for me.

182
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
I have some business

183
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,399
and have to go out first.

184
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,919
Alright, alright.

00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:55,960

Miss, you look new here.

186
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,759
It's your first time to Juxian Hall?

187
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,000
May I ask your surname? How can I help?

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,799
be it striking deals or cooking meals,

190
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,159
fighting bandits

191
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,159
or punching bad guys.

192
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,120
Be it for daily care or traveling,

193
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,559
you'll be in good hands.

194
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,799
Great.

195
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,279
I need to hire a few masters.

196
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,559
The very top ones.

197
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,600
Got it.

198
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,960
He is the top assassin

199
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,039
in the assassin's organization.

200
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
He is

201
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
a renowned Qing Kung master.

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,399
He may

203
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,480
look average,

204
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,440
but he is a master of traps.

205
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,360
He is proficient in various languages.

206
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,159
Getting intelligence is a piece of cake.

207
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,399
Various languages?

208
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,279
Then he also speaks Yuanjiang dialect?

209
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,159
Naturally.

210
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,399
His ancestry is from Yuanjiang.

211
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,559
You are rather sharing my mind.

212
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,080
I haven't yet stated my request.

213
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,519
You've already brought the people here.

214
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,399
This is the advantage of Juxian Hall.

215
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,279
The service is always up to standard.

216
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
What do you think about them?

217
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,960
If they are not good enough,

218
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,600
I have more choices.

219
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,399
No rush.

220
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,799
I have a few questions to ask.

221
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,240
Is it okay?

222
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,879
You wouldn't think showing up

223
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,960
would be enough
for her to make a decision, right?

224
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,799
Please enlighten us.

225
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,600
She

226
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,600
is clever.

227
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,000
The first question
she wants to ask is...

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,159
Whether you know each other.

229
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,159
Whether you work well with each other.

230
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,200
It seems to be about your abilities.

231
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
But actually,
she is probing into your backgrounds.

232
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,240
How should we respond then?

233
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
Since we're all working in Juxian Hall,

234
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,159
we're somewhat familiar with each other.

235
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
We've cooperated a few times.

236
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
I think we work well.

237
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,399
If I were to employ you,

238
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,720
you'll serve

239
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,799
one employer or two?

240
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,559
If she asks this question,

241
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,039
it means she's already guessed

242
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,360
that I am your employer.

243
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,519
No need to hide. Just tell the truth.

244
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,320
Two.

245
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,600
(What exactly do you want?)

246
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,320
(Do you think it's touching)

247
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,159
(to do this behind?)

248
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:55,879
Young master.

249
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,559
If she employs you,

250
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,200
it means there's still hope for me.

251
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,279
Since you are already employed,

252
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,320
it's better
that I just leave you to him.

253
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,159
Boss,

254
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,879
please find someone else for me.

255
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,904
Here's the commission.

256
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,399
The right amount.

257
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,159
Miss, would you like to think about it?

258
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,720
They are all top experts.

259
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,600
They are...

260
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,399
Miss.

261
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,279
Young master, you can't always

262
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,559
hide like this.

263
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,639
Now, no matter what I say,
she does not believe.

264
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,559
Only by unveiling the truth

265
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,080
will she see everything clearly.

266
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:42,840
(Zhili,)

267
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,000
(you want to draw a line between us.)

268
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,759
(Then I'll help you behind the scene.)

269
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,080
Has Qing Xing returned?

270
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,279
Move.

271
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,039
I'm too tired.

272
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,200
Hey man.

273
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
You've taken half a day
for just three miles.

274
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,879
Can you walk more quickly?

275
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,000
My hands are tied up like this.

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,519
How can I walk fast?

277
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,120
Why don't you help me untie it?

278
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
Untie it?

279
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,399
To let you run away?

280
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,519
This rope of the Mo family

281
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
really went through careful efforts.

282
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,240
Afraid that I would run away?

283
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,559
Just save it.

284
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,759
The earlier we arrive,

285
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,759
the earlier we end it.

286
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
I'll be fine then.

287
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,519
But don't you

288
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,600
worry about your young master?

289
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,519
Are you sure he's fine on his own?

290
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,879
I've heard

291
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,240
that the head of your young master

292
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,519
is worth a fortune in the Cult.

293
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,559
As you leave now,

294
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,200
if the Cult attacks,

295
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,559
your young master will be in danger.

296
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,639
I...

297
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll take a pee.

298
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,399
(During the Mid-Autumn Festival
over the past years,)

299
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,399
(I had tied a knot for my master)

300
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,639
(and senior each.)

301
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,480
Then you will also

302
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,360
tie a knot for me as a gift.

303
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:46,919
Is it okay?

304
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,519
Aren't gifts

305
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,759
only for birthdays?

306
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,559
Today

00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,840
