=Episode 28=

11
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,960
Physician Shen, please.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,960
Physician Shen,

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,000
thank you for just now.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
Let me toast to you.

15
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,640
Thank you.

16
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,799
(You can't hold your liquor at all.)

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,760
(Don't drink it.)

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,079
(You've had recent stomachaches.)

19
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,920
(Don't drink it.)

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,840
It was my oversight.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,359
I shouldn't have urged her to drink.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,040
Have some tea.

23
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,159
Young Master Su?

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,159
(I can't even drink tea?)

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,040
(No, it's that I want it.)

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,359
(Are you sure you're not jealous?)

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,159
Young Master, he is here.

28
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,879
(He is here.)

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,079
(Why has he come here too?)

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
(Didn't I ask my senior
to keep an eye on Ding Wuya?)

31
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,639
By my calculations, it's about time.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,960
I have to renew a pill for you,

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,919
lest you wake up and run around,

34
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,719
ruining our plan.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,439
(Someone intends
to harm the Hengshan Sect,)

36
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,759
(I need to notify them quickly.)

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,919
(Once they show up at the same time,)

38
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,520
(Yuyan's plan to disguise as Ding Wuya)

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,599
(will fail.)

40
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,199
(Then all we've done)

41
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,759
(will become useless.)

42
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,360
(Then we won't be able
to control Yuyan's actions,)

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,639
(and we'll lose the initiative.)

44
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,280
Senior, Wuji wine is here.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,159
It's just

46
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,360
a piece of cake.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,960
Do I even need to be sent for this?

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
It was overkill.

49
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,320
(Wuji)

50
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,599
So you are Ding Wuya.

51
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,520
Your senior was just talking about you.

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,400
Pleased to meet you.

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,432
Pleased to meet you.

54
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,919
Twelfth Night, Young Master Su,

55
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,719
pleased to meet you.

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,199
There's no time like the present.

57
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,280
Let's spar.

58
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,800
All right.

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Young Master Ding,

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,360
I am truly sorry.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,520
Young Master Su is a bit drunk.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,536
Qing Xing, help him back to rest.

63
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,159
Yes.

64
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,719
Excuse me.

65
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,399
Monitor him closely.

66
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,040
Yes.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
Dear, just now,

68
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,920
were you worried I would fight him?

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,120
No, not really.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,240
You feared the two Dings might meet

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
and ruin our plan.

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,519
In urgency, you grabbed his shoulder

73
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,839
to divert everyone's attention.

74
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,920
It's just that,

75
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,399
he was standing right in front of me.

76
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,079
I got a bit flustered.

77
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,360
I don't know his true face,

78
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,759
but thinking that

79
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,199
time and again he has thwarted
my efforts to revive my master,

80
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,879
I could hardly wait to capture him.

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,639
It's just that

82
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,560
we have more important things to do.

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,240
Do you know how my master

84
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,399
died?

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,839
Master, what are you doing?

86
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,959
My body is extreme Yang.

87
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,360
Once I start bleeding,
it doesn't stop easily.

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,439
You know that.

89
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,560
This time, the injury is a bit severe.

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Just wait.

91
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,240
I will save you.

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,839
Wake up!

93
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,680
Senior.

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
Master took us

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,759
to get herbs for you.

96
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,319
We got separated.

97
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,000
When we found him,

98
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,160
he was already...

99
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,839
Senior.

100
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,480
Master!

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,439
How could this happen?

102
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,439
Master!

103
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,959
He taught me medical skills,

104
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,639
and gave me the feeling of a family.

105
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,639
He didn't seem like my master,

106
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
but more like my father.

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,160
To save me,

108
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,079
he lost his life.

109
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,639
And yet even now,

110
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,879
I couldn't bring him back.

111
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,639
Zhili,

112
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,839
everyone's fate is determined.

113
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,360
Do not carry such a heavy burden

114
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
on your own shoulders.

115
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,399
Now that you are here to share it,

116
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,639
I am truly fortunate.

117
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,879
I will always be with you,

118
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,560
in life or death.

119
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,399
Why speak of death?

120
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,319
Don't say it.

121
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,439
We have eyes on the fake Ding Wuya.

122
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,000
Next,

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,279
we just need to follow the plan.

124
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,000
Those two actually invited us again.

125
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,519
After yesterday's interaction,

126
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,120
they still can't see our relationship?

127
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,879
So persistent.

128
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,560
Alright.

129
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,639
However, the Hengshan Sect

130
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,199
has been practicing daily
in the nearby courtyard.

131
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
It's a good opportunity to watch
Ding Wuya.

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,519
That being said,

133
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,519
I still have to remind you.

134
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,279
Not to get too close to Du Yizhi.

135
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:51,879
But,

136
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,040
I am

137
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,279
about to walk with another woman
in Wumo Villa.

138
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,199
I hope you take it seriously.

139
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,959
Young Master Su.

140
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,000
Brother,

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
later on, draw away Physician Shen.

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,759
I want to be alone with Young Master Su.

143
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,680
Physician Shen,

144
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,439
the flowers over there are blooming.

145
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,160
How about we go for a walk?

146
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,279
Okay.

147
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,040
Please.

148
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,320
Look.

149
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,399
To win this Martial Arts Convention,

150
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,600
our Hengshan Sect has been working hard.

151
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,879
You will definitely

152
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,320
see us shine in the competition.

153
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,799
It's to chop first then push, right?

154
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,279
(Ding Wuya's move seems
different from others.)

155
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,960
The competition is about to begin.

156
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,919
How about I take your pulses

157
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,600
to check on your condition in advance?

158
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,879
Your heart condition

159
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,279
requires some tonics.

160
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,320
Alright.

161
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,600
Divine Physician, this way.

162
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,639
If you need any help,

163
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,480
come to me anytime.

164
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,639
Okay, senior.

165
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,120
Okay, thank you, senior.

166
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,840
You've been staying up late too much.

167
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,039
You're a bit deficient in qi.

168
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,879
I'll write you a prescription.

169
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,000
Come and get it tomorrow.

170
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,519
Wuya,

171
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,279
come here.

172
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,039
Let's have a check.

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,919
I don't like you.

174
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,840
Don't rush to reject me.

175
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,600
Give me a chance.

176
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
I'll show you how good I can be.

177
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,639
(Strange, how come there's no pulse?)

178
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,919
Physician Shen,

179
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,080
I've been
practicing a mysterious martial art,

180
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
called Breath Holding.

181
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,799
This technique is forbidden
by the Hengshan Sect.

182
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,279
Please don't tell others.

183
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,960
You seem to be very diligent.

184
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,840
You're very healthy.

185
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,600
Here you go.

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,519
Thank you, Physician Shen.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
(Something's off with him.)

188
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,399
Physician Shen, thank you.

189
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,080
It's nothing.

190
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,000
Physician Shen,

191
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,399
I like you.

192
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,039
Is there already someone you like?

193
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,320
It's not that I like her.

194
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,120
It's love.

195
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,360
So you don't know it yet.

196
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,200
Xiao confesses her love
to Young Master Su.

197
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,720
Perhaps

198
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
she has already succeeded.

199
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,159

what I was thinking was

that this open space is suitable for him
to practice martial arts,

So,

214
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,440

what he will do with other women,

215
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,799

Not at all.

229
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
I was looking for someone else.

230
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,840
But I

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,039

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,480
Consider it returning a favor.

243
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,679
Let's go.

244
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,039
The usual place.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,759
You'll have it.

246
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,320
No need, you go.

247
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,720
You go.

248
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,559
You can't possibly think that

249
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,240
seeing the two just now

250
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,320
was why I'm in a bad mood, right?

251
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,639
You can't possibly think that

252
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,679
I'm upset because of that too, right?

253
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
The reason I was clinging to Su Chenche

254
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,120
was because I wanted to use his power

255
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,039
to escape the Cult.

256
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,039
I didn't have any other intentions.

257
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,000
Now I want to form an alliance with him,

258
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,519
I can't have other intentions.

259
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,519
My relationship with Zhili
is just like brother and sister.

260
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,519
So with that said,

261
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,480
you really did want to drink with me

262
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,639
and come to comfort me?

263
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,679
After all, you're my lifesaver.

264
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,399
It's the least I can help with.

265
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,399
You promised to do three things for me.

266
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,720
This is the first one.

267
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:04,279
What are you looking at?

268
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,159
Your face.

269
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
After all,

270
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,200
only for the sake of your face

271
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,279
did I saved you.

272
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,720
Right now, I really want

273
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,559
to ask you to do the second thing.

274
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,120
Pledge yourself to me.

275
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,600
Are you sure?

276
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,159
Do you not dare?

277
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:48,800
(Drinking Restaurant)

278
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,399
My apologies to you.

279
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,039
Today

280
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,519
we're fully booked.

281
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,639
Sir,

282
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,000
my wife would like to have a meal.

283
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,879
If you

284
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,399
really find it inconvenient,

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,879
I don't mind booking the entire place.

286
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,759
This...

287
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,960
This is a bit hard.

288
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,159
Don't trouble the innkeeper.

289
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,480
We have a place to sit now.

290
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,919
Senior.

291
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Why didn't you return
to Wumo Villa last night?

292
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,639
I went to gather information for you.

293
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,200
So, what did you uncover?

294
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,480
You went to gather information?

295
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,919
Then I must listen carefully.

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,399
Right Guardian, Yu Lian,

297
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,320
has come to Wumo City.

298
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,679
Can we speak in private?

299
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,120
I won't do

300
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,000
anything behind her back.

301
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,319
We are all acquaintances.

302
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,359
Speak freely.

303
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,440
I know you've always wanted
to eradicate the Cult.

304
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,200
I can offer you a helping hand.

305
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,799
But in return,

306
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,839
you'll need to help me
break away from them.

307
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,160
And grant me an identity

308
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,279
recognized by martial world.

309
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,599
Why should I trust you?

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,279
Because, like you,

311
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,799
I detest the Cult.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,240
Senior,

313
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,079
in order to keep him from waking up,

314
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,400
you actually used needles

315
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,359
to seal all his meridians.

316
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,200
You are quite ruthless.

317
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
Because last time

318
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,680
this guy nearly spoiled everything.

319
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Go ahead,

320
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
what do you want from me?

321
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,960
Senior,

322
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
I wanted to ask you...

323
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,359
No idea.

324
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,680
I haven't even asked yet.

325
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,839
And you said you don't know?

326
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,279
Do you think

327
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,720
I was going to ask about
you and Ye Qianqian?

328
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,680
No.

329

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,599

333

334
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,079

However,

336
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,279
