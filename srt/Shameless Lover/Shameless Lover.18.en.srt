=Episode 18=

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,759
How could it not be?

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,280
Under the guise of justice,

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,920
seizing what one desires.

14
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,719
In my opinion,

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,320
your unscrupulous methods

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,600
are hardly more noble than ours.

17
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,039
Killing me would be futile.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,239
We have already won.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,840
You will never get the Ice Jade Bowl.

20
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,319
Ice Jade Bowl.

21
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,280
It's finally my turn, isn't it?

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,000
This time,

23
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,599
you still want to kill me?

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Last time?

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,719
Kill you?

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
You remember?

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,239
Yes.

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,719
I remember it all.

29
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,560
But I remembered

30
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,120
too late.

31
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,280
This time,

32
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,400
I won't let you succeed.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,240
Hold on,

34
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,599
(Dear.)

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
(Whether it's my life)

36
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,800
(or my chastity,)

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
(they're both yours.)

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,039
Shen Zhili

39
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,240
is my, Su Chenche's,

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,400
only love of life.

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
If I tell you Su Chenche
is faking amnesia,

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,719
would you still send me away?

43
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,400
Why are you still holding me?

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm not hurt.

45
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,479
Because

46
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,400
I don't want to be apart from you again.

47
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,520
Even until mountains are edgeless

48
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,919
and rivers run dry,

49
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,599
I will not

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
leave you.

51
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,960
(Master, Senior,)

52
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,240
(I'm sorry.)

53
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,439
(I still couldn't do it.)

54
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,319
(Su Chenche,)

55
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,199
(if there's another chance,)

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,039
(I will definitely)

57
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,360
(make your life worse than death.)

58
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,368
(Three months ago.)

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,800
Greetings, Lord.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,839
(So, if I die, time resets too.)

61
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,399
Starting from
the first time he killed me,

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,920
for some unknown reason

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,240
we fell into a cycle of time resets.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
Either of us, whoever dies,

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,319
will initiate a time reset.

66
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,399
Last time,

67
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,600
I suffered a severe blow to the head.

68
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
After the time reset,

69
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,639
I lost my previous memories.

70
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,079
Therefore, he took the initiative.

71
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,439
(Twelfth Night Splendor seeds)
His purpose in approaching you

72
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,560
is to get the three core ingredients

73
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,839
to revive his mother.

74
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,839
Deceived me,

75
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,000
fooled me,

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,639
killed me,

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,560
and even killed my innocent senior.

78
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
If I stood in his way,

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,240
he will surely kill me again.

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,279
Su Chenche,

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,839
this time,

82
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,959
I come with memory.

83
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,639
I won't let you

84
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,199
succeed.

85
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,439
Lord.

86
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,480
I need you to do something.

87
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,279
Yes.

88
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,319
Young master,

89
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,360
are we really going to Huichun Valley?

90
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,759
If this is exposed...

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
(From the first cycle,)

92
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
(she does not remember before death.)

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
(Then this time,)

94
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
(perhaps she also doesn't remember.)

95
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,839
What are you doing?

96
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,160
Young master,

97
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
those unharmed and without an invitation

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,120
cannot enter Huichun Valley.

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,040
I'm helping you.

100
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's take a look first.

101
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,560
Yes.

102
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,120
(This is a trap.)

103
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,959
(I didn't see it last time.)

104
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,519
(Why would it be this way this time?)

105
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,920
(Not seeing me.)

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,399
(What exactly is she planning?)

107
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,480
(I can only try it out.)

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,839
Young master.

109
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,896
Be careful.

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,519
Su Chenche,

111
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,879
how does it feel
to be shot through the heart?

112
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,519
Did you feel the pain I felt then?

113
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Young master!

114
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,040
Young master!

115
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,184
(Half an hour ago)

116
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,240
That trap was deadly.

117
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,480
What on earth does she mean?

118
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,759
Trap?

119
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,319
Young master,
what are you talking about?

120
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,519
And who is she?

121
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,920
I must find out.

122
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,319
Zhili.

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
You killed my senior,

124
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
fooled me,

125
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
and kept me from
bringing back my master.

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Su Chenche,

127
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,319
even dying ten thousand times
isn't enough for you!

128
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,120
(Half an hour ago)

129
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
Qing Xing,

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,240
dig a tunnel leading

131
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
to the inside of Huichun Valley.

132
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,759
Yes.

133
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:54,879
Lord,

134
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,919
Twelfth Night Young Master
entered that room.

135
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,559
It's about time.

136
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,879
Go and see how he died.

137
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,600
Yes.

138
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,240
Dear.

139
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,080
(Fortunately, I prepared)

140
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,799
(this sharp dagger)

141
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,240
I finally found you!

142
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,559
Why?

143
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,440
Why?

144
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
Because you spoke out of line,

145
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,759
recklessly calling me "Dear".

146
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,159
You truly don't remember.

147
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,720
I am Su Chenche.

148
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,559
You are my wife.

149
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,600
Young Master Su,

150
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,039
you might not know
the rules of Huichun Valley.

151
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,360
Without invitation or agreement,
those who broke in

152
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,000
will all die.

153
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,799
So,

154
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,039
you want to do it yourself this time?

155
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,919
I don't know what you are talking about.

156
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,200
But my doing this

157
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,639
is to help you.

158
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,960
(Serious injuries,
paralyzed on one side,)

159
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
(that's when I have an opportunity.)

160
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,440
Stabbing twice,

161
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,000
avoiding the vital points.

162
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,000
Do you hate me?

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,879
(Su Chenche, how can I not hate you?)

164
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,440
(You claim to control everything.)

165
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,360
(Yet you're unaware I have the memories
from the last cycle.)

166
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,120
(You try to repeat the same old tricks.)

167
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,039
(This time, I will not let you win.)

168
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,799
Young Master Su, you're overthinking it.

169
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,840
We met only for the first time.

170
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,600
Where is the love and hate from?

171
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,440
But if you want to see me,

172
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,799
you must have a fatal wound.

173
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,840
(Now, we can have a proper talk.)

174
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,159
(Crow Silver Needle)

175
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,519
(will surely paralyze half of you.)

176
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,120
(In such case, you'll have to spend
the rest of your life lying here.)

177
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,039
(And I)

178
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,759
(can then obtain
the three core ingredients)

179
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,759
(to revive Master.)

180
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,240
You were badly injured.

181
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,879
How did you...

182
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,159
I've been pondering a question.

183
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,120
Even if you don't remember your death,

184
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,559
don't you even remember

185
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,399
the feelings between us?

186
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,000
Let go of me.

187
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,279
Or I'll make your death suffering.

188
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,879
In your hands,

189
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,600
I've already lost count
of how many times I've died.

190
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,000
I just want to understand one thing.

191
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,480
Why are you acting so out of character?

192
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,559
(After doing so many treacherous deeds,)

193
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,559
(you still have the audacity to ask.)

194
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,080
(It's time to attend to the business.)

195
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,279
(Unable to move.)

196
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,200
(It has come to this.)

197
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,840
It's not good.

198
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,559
Young Master Su committed suicide
by biting his tongue!

199
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,240
This is bad.

200
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,759
(Can't let him off so easily.)

201
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:30,752
(One day ago.)

202
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,559
(Zhili,)

203
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,919
(this time,)

204
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
(don't blame me for using the hard way.)

205
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,559
Answer the question I asked last time,

206
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,480
or we'll repeat the loop forever.

207
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,320
(This time,)

208
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,000
(Senior should show up.)

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,799
(I'll take the risk.)

210
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
What are you going to do?

211
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,799
You're bullying me!

212
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,720
I am not!

213
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,120
Who's bullying Zhili?

214
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,639
Long time no see.

215
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,279
You've become even more foolish,

216
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,519
to actually be entangled by a patient.

217
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,759
Senior.

218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
Great.

219
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,080
You have returned.

220
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,279
(That time, it must be very painful.)

221
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,679
(It's all my fault.)

222
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,080
Zhili, what is this?

223
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,679
You know that he once died.

224
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,679
That's why you're reacting this way now.

225
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,440
You did that just now because

226
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,919
you knew Hua Jiuye's getting here.

227
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,752
So,

228
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,120
you haven't forgotten.

229
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,720
You are pretending.

230
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,960
Why is this?

231
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,480
Senior, he bullied me.

232
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Even cursed you to die.

233
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,399
He must think we're weak.

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,200
You want to die?

235
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Senior!

236
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,120
(Su Chenche,)

237
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,639
(last time, you killed my senior,)

238
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,720
(and this time, you should pay for it.)

239
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,720
Senior, spare his life.

240
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,000
Fortunately, not dead.

241
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,079
(Must resolve this trouble quickly.)

242
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,880
Senior,

243
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,039
I want to borrow your poison.

244
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,119
You, a physician,

245
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,599
want do you want my poison?

246
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,119
He's no ordinary man.

247
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,119
I need a special way

248
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,200
to make him suffer unbearably pain,

249
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,680
the kind that leaves him bedridden.

250
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,799
How so, is he your enemy?

251
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,640
Keep a good watch on Young Master Su.

252
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Yes.

253
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,519
Gnawing at the heart, eroding the bones,
draining the blood,

254
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,119
yet hanging on by a breath.

255
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,519
Zhili,

256
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,400
we haven't seen each other for years.

257
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,880
You've become more and more ruthless.

258
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,079
I like it.

259
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,559
Next,

260
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,799
