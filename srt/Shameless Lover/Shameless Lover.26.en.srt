Dear.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,079
Hungry?

20
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,280
Hibiscus cake.

21
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,439
Why do you know I'm craving this now?

22
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,959
I haven't told you yet, have I?

23
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,400
My mother loves making hibiscus cakes.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
She...

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,040
That little girl

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
reminds me of my childhood.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
Back then,

28
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,959
if I hadn't trusted my uncle,

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,680
I wouldn't have put myself in danger.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,759
And my mother wouldn't have...

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,120
Since then,

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,159
I often regret it.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
Why did I trust someone

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
who once deceived me.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm also thinking

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,360
that if I had money,

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,479
or medical skills,

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,960
could

39
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,240
I have saved my mother?

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,599
Zhili,

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
you did it.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,560
Moreover,

43
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,360
you did it very well.

44
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,080
Really?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,960

84
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,680
Okay.

85
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,600
By the way, I've almost recovered.

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,839
I plan to go to Wumo Villa soon.

87
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,879
I'm sorry to let you

00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,199

89
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,000
It's just that

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,680
Huichun Valley is never involved in
martial world strife.

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,879
This time we...

92
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,560
Last time we had no opportunity.

93
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,040
(Invitation)
This time, I got an invitation

94
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,336
to serve as a volunteer physician.

95
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:08,480
This way, we're not
against Huichun Valley's principle

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
of no involvement in martial conflicts.

97
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,879
(Special invitation to Divine Physician Shen)
We can also attend it openly.

98
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,839
This is perfect.

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,480
Young master.

100
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,079
How is it?

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,079
From now on, Physician Shen
can fully represent me.

102
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,560
No need to hide anything from her.

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Go ahead.

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,480
Yes.

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,079
Our people chased after him all the way,

106
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,199
but lost him after about a hundred li.

107
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,000
Then we ran into Young Master Hua.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
He learned about the situation,

109
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
then went chase him,

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,680
and asked me to tell you.

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,079
What? My senior is chasing after him?

112
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,560
He's no match for Yuyan.

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,800
Physician Shen, don't worry.

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,959
Top masters of Twelfth Night
are with him.

115
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,600
He also asked me to tell you

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,079
he'll wait for you at the convention.

117
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,160
It is what it is.

118
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,959
Don't worry.

119
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,024
(Wumo Villa)

120
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,240
Lady Shen, Twelfth Night
Young Master, it's an honor

121
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,319
for Wumo Villa to have you two here.

122
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,879
Please come in.

123
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,360
Quite a gentleman!

124
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,680
Exactly, extraordinary demeanor.

125
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,120
So handsome.

126
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,600
Act as planned.

127
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,439
- Copy that.
- Truly seeing is believing.

128
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:34,016
(Wumo Villa)

129
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,399
This is

130
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,240
the stronghold of the Cult we found

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,480
near Wumo Villa previously.

132
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,839
This time,

133
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,279
we're here several days in advance.

134
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,720
We can set up surveillance early,

135
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,279
and search it more thoroughly,

136
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,759
in case of any missing ones.

137
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,600
Yes.

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,399
Right,

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,040
Yu Lian has an Herbal Hut.

140
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,240
It's ten li away from the Villa.

141
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,639
Last time, Yuyan also appeared there.

142
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,560
Don't worry.

143
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,759
I have arranged more people

144
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,720
lying in ambush there.

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,319
It's a pity

146
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,079
that we cannot capture them directly
this time.

147
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,680
Just capturing Yuyan

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,800
may make the Cult harm even more

149
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,120
people in the martial world.

150
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,399
So we can only act accordingly.

151
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,040
When the time comes,

152
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,079
we capture them all.

153
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,600
Yes.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So this time,

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
we need to craft strategies

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,199
to deal with Yuyan and the Cult,

157
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,199
but also protect

158
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,079
those innocent victims involved.

159
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,240
If Yuyan and Yu Lian

160
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,600
take the same actions as last time,

161
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
that would be the best.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,519
But if they change their actions,

163
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,480
it would be somewhat tricky.

164
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,600
We need to come up with a new plan

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,639
to respond.

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
If they repeat their actions

167
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,960
last time,

168
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,840
is Ding Wuya,

169
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
whose identity got used and died,

170
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,759
the first person we need to protect?

171
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
I've asked Qing Xing

172
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,200
to ambush at the location

173
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
where Ding Wuya's body was found

174
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,519
last time.

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,600
I want to go there and have a look.

176
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,240
Okay.

177
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,159
This is Windless Cliff.

178
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,200
Cross here

179
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,679
and across the slope. There it is.

180
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,879
What's wrong, dear?

181
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,440
Last time, my senior was here...

182
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,159
I thought

183
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,480
when he went to Yuanjiang,

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,279
and wouldn't get involved.

185
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,440
I didn't expect

186
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,480
that he's still involved.

187
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,679
This Yuyan is so cunning and sly.

188
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,759
I'm worried about my senior.

189
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,879
Dear, don't worry.

190
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,399
He asked you

191
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,159
to await him
at the Martial Arts Convention.

192
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,279
He's got his plan.

193
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,919
Don't worry.

194
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,480
If you want to stay alive,

195
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,840
come here and stop my bleeding now.

196
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
The last one
who dared to threaten me like this

197
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,080
has already died.

198
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,480
But, for the sake of your face,

199
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll save you.

200
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
What a beauty.

201
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,519
It's you.

202
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,000
I saved you.

203
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,399
Where are my clothes?

204
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Thrown away.

205
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,919
What?

206
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,600
What are you shy about?

207
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,240
When you were unconscious,

208
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
I applied the medicine like this.

209
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,320
I must kill you.

210
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,919
I know you are a martial expert,

211
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,679
both in drugs,

212
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,159
and in poisons.

213
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,679
You kill people unnoticeably.

214
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,039
But now you can't move, can you?

215
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,960
You.

216
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,720
A witch and a demon-physician,

217
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,039
why care for manners?

218
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,799
Didn't expect

219
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,039
the change of the weather.

220
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,679
You're not omniscient.

221
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,480
How could you predict the weather?

222
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,759
Here.

223
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,440
I had Qing Xing prepare these.

224
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,080
Let's hang our clothes there now.

225
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,159
Don't get sick.

226
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,799
Okay.

227
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,879
It's really hard to predict the changes.

228
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,679
As you see, can we

229
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,240
capture Yuyan this time?

230
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,399
Can we protect those

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,480
innocent people involved?

232
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,840
What if everything changes?

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
It doesn't go as it did last time.

234
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,799
What should we do then?

235
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
Is Lady Shen at home?

236
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,600
At home or not?

237
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,320
Young Master Su left a message to you.

238
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,440
He said, Lady Shen, do not worry.

239
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,879
This time we have the upper hand.

240
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,440
There should be no problem whatsoever.

241
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,519
He also wanted to tell you

242
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,080
to take it easy.

243
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
No matter what,

244
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,200
he will always

245
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,600
be with you.

246
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,639
But...

247
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,600
My dear.

248
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,039
My dear.

249
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,360
Where is my beautiful, charming,

250
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,720
and wise lady?

251
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,879
Like this?

252
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,039
My dear,

253
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
it's getting dark.

254
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,080
Come home with me.

255
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,879
There's a bad wolf out there.

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Okay, then let's go home.

♪My best expectation♪

276
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,360
Based on Young Master's description,
the place that fits best

277
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,480
is probably here.

278
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,480
Last time, Qing Xing found the body,

279
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,840
directly sent it to Yi Manor.

280
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,679
So, the exact location,

281
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,600
I can not...

282
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,880
The slope has dry soil.
The foot of the hill has clay.

283
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,279
Here, it's moist soil.

284
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,759
Based on our last experience,

285
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,599
when Ding Wuya's body was found,

286
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,400
it had decomposed beyond recognition.

287
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Within the same amount of time,

288
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,880
a body buried in moist soil
decomposes more easily.

289
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,839
Yuyan certainly knows it.

290
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,359
So, the most likely place

291
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,759
is right here.

292
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,039
Five more chi down.

293
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,319
If it's really as you said,

294
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,279
the few concealed surveillance spots
we've set up

295
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,440
are easily discovered.

296
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
We need to expand the area,

297
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
and adjust.

298
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,039
I'll relay the orders now.

299
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,880
Dear, this is...

300
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,680
This is the potion I made.

301
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,759
It can repel insects and ants
within one zhang in the soil.

302
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:10,240
In this way,
if something does happen to Ding Wuya,

303
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,039
his body can be protected

304
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,680
from insects and ants
as much as possible.

305
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,599
This increases our chance of saving him.

306
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,400
My dear,

307
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,920
this time, we will make it.

308
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Sure.
