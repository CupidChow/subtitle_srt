00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:43,008
(Drinking Restaurant)

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,200
Please enjoy your meal.

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,600
Sir?

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,560
Yeah.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,280
What are these dishes?

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,520
This is "Monarch's Steadfast Cake".

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,159
This is "Concubine's Reed Tea".

18
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,079
This is "Endless Love Noodles".

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,719
This is "Wings in Pair".

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Sir,

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,920
your dishes

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,359
all have such unique names.

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,519
That's because we specialize
in meals for couples.

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,200
(Matchmaker's Delight)

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,719
Then, sir,

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,040
do you have any other signature dishes?

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,159
Yes, we do.

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,480
"Joyous Union Soup",

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,719
"Bridal Chamber Candle Cake",

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,480
"Wedding Night Rice".

31
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,079
Are you feeling better?

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,319
Much better, dear.

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,719
You truly share a deep love,
a match made in heaven.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,920
This is the "Joyful Reunion Soup".

35
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,079
Enjoy your meal.

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280
Look, the Hengshan Sect has arrived.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,120
It's their Master Du.

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,000
They're here.

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,392
(Inn)

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,588
(Wumo Villa)

41
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,920
(Ding Wuya, Hengshan Sect Disciple)

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Hengshan Sect, Ding Wuya.

43
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,080
Twelfth Night, Su Chenche.

44
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,039
Ding Wuya
is the youngest disciple Hengshan.

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
He is simple,

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,960
good at martial arts,

47
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,039
naive and passionate.

48
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,759
He has just come of age this year.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
He's just fifteen now.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,039
This time,

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,039
we must act before Yuyan makes a move

52
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,879
and save him.

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,520
You said he doesn't yet have that scent,

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
which means Yuyan hasn't approached him.

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
There's still time.

56
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,680
But the problem is,

57
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,680
how do we get close to protect him

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
without being detected?

59
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:05,919
Here's the Resurrection Pill.

60
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,280
If taken, it causes severe injury

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
and a deathlike state in six hours.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
He'll briefly cease breathing,

63
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,879
and at the brink of death,

64
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,360
it'll protect his heart meridians.

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,280
However,

66
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,759
we need to get him to take it.

67
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,280
How do you think he will

68
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,520
make him take the medicine?

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
Given my young master's cautious nature,

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
I believe he will adopt

71
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,280
a very gentle approach

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,520
to make Ding Wuya feel comfortable.

73
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,919
Ding Wuya

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,639
is too cautious.

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,280
Once begun, he is hard to deal with.

76
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,479
This is the fastest solution.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,599
Alright.

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
But after taking this medicine,

79
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,520
he needs to sleep for ten hours,

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,680
and must not be disturbed.

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,719
We need an absolutely quiet place.

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,080
I know a place.

83
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,279
Young Master, then I will take my leave.

Ding Wuya woke up fine this morning.

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,639
So I pretended not to have woken up

120
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,639
and let him go.

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Rest assured.

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
Qing Xing will secretly follow him.

123
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,040
So the petty thief

124
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,120
dare come to Wumo Villa too.

125
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,879
I didn't expect

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,680
that you would dare to address

128
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,560
Lifesaver?

129
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,040
The lifesaver stripped me bare.

130

Inch by inch, time after time.

From top to bottom, outside to inside.

Even the birthmark on your rear,

135
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,720
I remember it all.

136
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,560
I never owe anyone favors.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
I would fulfill three tasks for you.

138
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,120
Hurry and tell me.

139
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,519
You're going to owe me again.

140
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,519
You want to enter the Wumo Villa.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,279
Only I can help you with it.

142
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
How?

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,920
Follow me.

144
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,040
Is this going to work or not?

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,360
Wait a bit longer. What's the rush?

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,959
What are we waiting for?

147
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,839

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,879
Put it on.

151
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,279
I won't.

152
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,839
Whatever.

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,279
(the rumors about me.)

156
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,920
(Better let me handle it directly.)

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,680
(This isn't only about the three of us,)

158
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
(but also the Cult behind her.)

159
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,360
(As Left Guardian of the Cult,)

160
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,040
(and having a connection with Yu Lian,)

161
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,000
(perhaps,)

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
(she could bring us
some news about the Cult.)

163
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,679
You and I are not

164
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,759
in such a relationship

165
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,279
that can drink tea together, right?

166
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,879
With mutual pining,

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,759
the wedding day is near.

168
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,759
I warn you,

169
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,120
don't destroy my happy marriage.

170
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,159
I didn't expect Yuyan to be so good.

171
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,720
Highly skilled in martial arts,
extremely good at disguise.

172
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,840
This is also why after so long

173
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,320
I still can't capture him.

174
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,559
I've discovered something strange.

175
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,519
When he crossed hands with me,

176
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,720
he knew my moves and poisons

177
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,080
very clearly.

178
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,440
Otherwise, with your skills,

179
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,279
you shouldn't have been injured by him.

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,519
Could it be...

181
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,879
He understands me so well.

182
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,720
Has he seen me?

183
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,519
Do you know something?

184
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,360
Look,

185
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,720
mulberries are just mulberries.

186
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,360
They can't turn into a flower.

187
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,879
Just like rumors.

188
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,720
No matter how they're exaggerated,

189
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,039
they're just a dark pool.

190
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,279
Sooner or later, they'll be exposed.

191
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,559
If you really want to leave the Cult,

192
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,679
marriage is not the only way.

193
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,720
I suggest you think it over.

194
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,240
I take my leave.

195
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,360
Senior,

196
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,879
how are your injuries?

197
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,679
I heard

198
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,720
The Cult has mastered martial arts

199
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
of all the sects,

200
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,080
even including the Huichun Valley.

201
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,279
I really wonder

202
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,080
what their next move will be.

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,679
How we can catch Yuyan?

204
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,879
Rest assured, Senior.

205
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
He has a unique scent on him.

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,279
As long as he shows up, I can find him.

207
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,559
We've found the body.

208
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
It's Ding Wuya.

209
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,480
He was buried by Yuyan on that hillside.

210
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,840
We've already dug him out.

211
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,480
The Resurrection Pill has taken effect.

212
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,320
He now looks no different from a dead.

213
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
But within four hours,

214
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,960
he will wake up.

215
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,519
Qing Xing has just reported

216
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
that the Hengshan Sect
is still unaware of this.

217
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,080
It seems everything is within our plan.

218
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,320
The next step is to watch over him

219
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,279
to ensure he doesn't appear
before the others,

220
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,759
especially the Hengshan Sect.

221
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,279
But Qing Xing has another task tonight.

222
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,240
We are

223
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,240
going to the oath-taking ceremony.

224
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,159
Then who will guard Ding Wuya?

225
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,840
Half of our plan has been completed.

226
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Now we just wait for
the fake Ding Wuya to show up.

227
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,639
Tonight's ceremony,

228
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,080
all Hengshan Sect people will be there.

229
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,759
He should be there too.

230
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,519
Do you remember the three agreements?

231
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,519
The first agreement

232
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,720
is not to lose sight of each other.

233
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,120
That was the last loop.

234
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,360
This time,
I only remember the new rules.

235
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,919
Must not approach Ding Wuya.

236
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,679
He is very dangerous.

237
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,639
If you can confirm it,

238
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,720
do not act rashly.

239
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,559
First, ensure your own safety.

240
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,279
Leave the rest to me.

241
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,720
Alright.

242
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:00,440
(Loyalty is Always Evident)
Twelfth Night, Su Chenche,

243
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
Huichun Valley, Shen Zhili are here.

244
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
- Young Master Su.
- Young Master Su.

245
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,279
- Physician Shen.
- Physician Shen.

246
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,799
I hope at the convention,

247
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,200
we can capture Yuyan

248
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,600
and annihilate the Cult,

249
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,399
as well as prevent
a martial world catastrophe.

250
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,080
And save more innocent people.

251
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,279
Dear,

252
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
this is helping people, isn't it?

253
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,720
Dear, eat while it's hot.

254
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,480
Okay.

255
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,840
Young Master Su, Physician Shen.

256
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,720
You must be Master Du's only daughter,

257
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Du Xiaoxiao, right?

258
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,159
You know about our Hengshan Sect?

259
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,799
Sure.

260
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,200
The Hengshan Sect is renowned.

261
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,679
I've long heard of it.

262
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,919
I'm delighted to meet you today.

263
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,240
It's just that,

264
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,639
I don't see the others of your Sect.

265
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,480
They've gone to get items.

266
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,399
They'll arrive shortly.

267
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,759
Do you have something to say?

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,480
I've known for a long time

269
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,080
the relationship of Young Master Su
and Ye Qianqian is fake.

270
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,200
It seems you know
Young Master Su very well.

271
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
You see,

272
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,960
do I have a chance?

273
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,960
You might as well try.

274
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,919
You two talk,

275
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,200
I shall take my leave first.

276
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,559
Want to destroy my holy sect?

277
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,440
How ridiculous.

278
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,919
Look, mulberries are just mulberries.

279
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,639
They can't turn into a flower.

280
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,080
Just like rumors.

281
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,960
No matter how they're exaggerated,

282
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,279
they're just a dark pool.

283
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,639
(Sooner or later, they'll be exposed.)

284
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
I have warned you.

285
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,480
When I am speaking,

286
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,759
you should listen carefully.

287
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,480
Don't you forget

288
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,320
that I am the Left Guardian.

289
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,360
Left Guardian?

290
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,120
You are more and more interesting.

291
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,120
How did you acquire this title?

292
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,840
Aren't you clear about it?

293
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,440
I want to leave.

294
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,840
You can't stop me.

295
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,279
Tonight is the night of the full moon.

296
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,120
It's already nighttime.

297
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,919
Your poison should be acting up.

298
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,240
I can only tolerate

299
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,279
your willfulness this one time.

300
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,960
Do your job well.

301
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,360
Otherwise, you won't get the antidote

302
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,960
for this month.

303
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,080
(If you want to leave the Cult,)

304
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,120
(marriage is not the only way.)

305
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,840
(I suggest you think it over.)

306
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,440
Our Hengshan Sect's swordsmanship

307
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,279
is ranked within the top ten.

308
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,840
What's your ranking?

309
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,159
How dare you vie for a seat.

310
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,759
What's so great about Hengshan Sect?

311
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,120
Then let's have a contest.

312
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,600
Come on.

313
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,639
Please calm your anger.

314
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,320
- Physician Shen.
- Physician Shen.

315
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,879
You have gathered here

316
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,679
to exterminate the Cult

317
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,480
and to prove oneself

318
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,440
fair and square to on the arena,

319
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,480
not just to gratify a momentary impulse

320
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,159
and bring disgrace to your own sect.

321
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,440
Liu Chu,
go to the leader for punishment.

322
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,120
Yes.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,799
I'll take my leave.

324
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,639
Physician Shen,

325
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
nice to meet you.

326
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,320
I've long admired you.

327
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,360
I am Du Yizhi from the Hengshan Sect.

328
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,119
I see, I know you.

329
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,039
I heard Hengshan Sect
is brimming with talent.

330
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,240
Not just you,

331
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
there's also a young and brave one,

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,839
Ding Wuya.

333
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,160
Where is he?

334
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,480
You flatter me.

335
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,039
Junior Ding

336
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,799
was sent by our leader to get

337
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,119
the Hengshan Sect's specialty,

338
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,160
Wuji wine.

339
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,319
Brother.

340
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,720
Let's go.

341
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,359
Physician Shen,

342
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,400
let's go together, this way please.

343
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,759
If we want to get close to Ding Wuya,

344
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,119
these two

345
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,720
will give us a good chance.

346
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,839
