11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,600
The incense...

12
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,359
It's a muscle relaxant powder

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,399
that renders you completely weak.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,520
Fool.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,799
Dear.

16
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,959
What is this?

17
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,239
A life-saving pill.

18
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,280
It can detoxify all poisons.

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,759
(You've finally shown yourself.)

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,439
(This face...)

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
This painting...

22
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,039
So the men of the Mingyue Palace

23
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,319
are all selected based on his likeness.

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,719
He is indeed extremely similar
to Su Chenche.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,199
No wonder Ji Mingyue
treated him differently.

26
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,360
August lily?

27
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,680
(Why is this underneath the painting?)

28
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,639
There are no signs of rummaging here.

29
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,800
Seems the Night Shadow Pearl isn't here.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
I won't be able

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,319
to leave this palace soon.

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
I've taken a fancy to you.

33
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,520
If you behave,

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,759
you'll have everything you wish for.

35
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,599
Thank you, Master.

36
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
But I already have a wife.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,639
I'm afraid I cannot comply
with your request.

38
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh?

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,960
What about your companion
in the secret chamber?

40
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,520
You lured me out

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,439
so that she could have a chance

42
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,919
to leave safely, right?

43
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,639
But what a pity.

44
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,319
You've underestimated
the Mingyue Palace.

45
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,520
Wait!

46
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,360
Why did you come here?

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,680
Put away the sword.

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,919
Put it away!

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Forgive us, Master.

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,400
My brother and I are new
to the Mingyue Palace.

51
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,879
I apologize for trespassing

52
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,079
into your chamber.

53
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,800
Please spare us,

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
Master.

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,759
You trespassed at a curious time.

56
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,560
Could it be that you are here

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
for the Night Shadow Pearl?

58
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
We wouldn't dare.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,839
This is all my fault.

60
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,759
I will do anything to compensate.

61
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,160
But

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,079
my brother is innocent.

63
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,560
Please let him go home, Master.

64
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,759
Interesting.

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,199
We will go home together.

66
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,600
I can defeat her.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,319
Shut up.

68
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,439
You're not qualified to serve me.

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
Your brother, however,
can stay and atone for it.

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
But...

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,399
What?

72
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,600
You refuse?

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,879
Master, surely you've noticed.

74
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,879
We...

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
Do you know
the consequences of deceiving me?

76
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,160
Master, please have mercy.

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,639
We are...

78
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,639
Take them down.

79
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,399
Yes.

80
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
Who do you think you are?

81
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,680
I don't understand why the Master

82
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,480
keeps you alive.

83
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,560
You...

84
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,519
If you touch her,

85
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,519
that will be the end for you.

86
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,160
If you ever do that again,

87
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
you won't see make it out alive.

88
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,839
Do you think I would let you

89
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,319
get out of here alive?

90
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,200
Su Chenche.

91
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,080
Dear.

92
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,039
Are you trying to murder
your own husband?

93
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,200
No.

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,919
How did you get out?

95
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,080
I borrowed Xiaoye's clothes to get out.

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
Xiaoye

97
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,879
lent you his clothes?

98
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,799
Without him knowing though.

99
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,399
Strip.

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
Not bad for
the Twelfth Night Young Master.

101
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
Simple and direct.

102
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
But this is good.

103
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,159
With these clothes,

104
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,159
it'd be easier to leave.

105
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,600
Leave?

106
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
Where to?

107
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
Just follow me.

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
I'll see you off from here.

109
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,519
Go.

110
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,519
Aren't you leaving with me?

111
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,600
I must obtain the Night Shadow Pearl.

112
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,919
Is that more valuable than your life?

113
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,519
It is.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,879
Take care of yourself.

115
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,399
Do you really want me to go?

116
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,159
Okay.

117
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,519
Let me rephrase the question.

118
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,159
Do you want me to stay with you?

119
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,000
This is my own affair.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,080
You don't need to risk your life.

121
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,039
You are my wife.

122
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,759
Fake wife.

123
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,120
(The Mingyue Palace has three halls:
left, center, and right.)

124
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,720
(The Night Shadow Pearl
is not in the main hall)

125
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,000
(or the sleeping chamber
within the main hall.)

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,799
(It can't possibly be
in the left or right halls.)

127
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,039
(Then where could it be?)

128
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
You were told not to wander around.

129
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,960
The stone forest in the back courtyard
is forbidden to your like.

130
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,039
That is where the Master practices.

131
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,240
A forbidden area.

132
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
I apologize, young master.

133
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,120
I won't do it again.

134
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,399
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
Please spare me.

136
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,759
It won't happen again.

My master once said

143
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,720
that August lilies grow in stony places.

144
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,559
Perhaps,

145
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,799

The Yang side has a dragon pattern.

The Yin side has a groove.

Young Master Su.

167
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,279
Are you looking for her?

168
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,559
The more you care about her,

169
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,799
the more I want to torment her.

170
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,840
Your love

171
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,240
will only harm her.

(This jade toggle and the groove
on the secret chamber door)

173
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,919
(are the same.)

174
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,960
What do you want?

175
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,240
What do I want?

176
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,200
I want you

177
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,399
to marry me.

178
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,440
Su Chenche.

179
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,480
Don't be coerced because of me.

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Of course I won't.

181
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,759
I'm the one who coerces others.

182
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,960
If you don't let her go,

183
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,559
I'll never be yours.

184
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,120
Don't!

185
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,080
You can't die.

186
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,720
Do you know
the consequences of doing this?

187
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,120
I assume the last thing you want

188
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,200
is my death.

189
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,159
It depends on who is faster.

190
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,759
(Ji Mingyue is by nature stubborn.)

191
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,799
(She's capable of anything when pushed.)

192
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,120
(Now that I'm so close,)

193
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
(I must first calm her down.)

194
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,279
Please calm your anger, Master.

195
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,759
You have misunderstood.

196
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,039
He and I

197
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,279
are just patient and physician.

198
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,600
Nothing more.

199
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,919
The reason he did this

200
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,559
is just to get your attention.

201
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,960
There's an old saying that goes

202
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,320
"What you can't have is the best."

203
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,919
He is only

204
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,200
playing hard to get.

205
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,480
Should I put in a few words for you?

206
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,440
Su Chenche.

207
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,279
Can you please stop this farce?

208
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,840
Put the knife down.

209
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,360
The Master is so affectionate to you.

210
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,519
How could you let her down?

211
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,440
Pick an auspicious day

212
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,600
and get married.

213
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
You sure know how to read the room.

214
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
So, what do you think, Young Master Su?

215
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,159
You...

216
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,879
You really want to see me marry her?

217
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,720
Of course.

218
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,279
Good.

219
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,679
As you wish then.

220
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,240
(Shen Zhili.)

221
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,360
(Don't you have any feelings for me?)

222
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,440
(How could you just gift me)

223
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
(to another woman?)

224
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,159
(He must be very mad now.)

225
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,480
(If it were me,)

226
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,399
(I'd probably...)

227
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,159
Ji Mingyue has already
sent out the wedding invitations

228
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,799
to Twelfth Night.

229
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,759
If it weren't for you,

230
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,519
my life

231
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,519
would have been in jeopardy.

232
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
Write it down.

233
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,080
What?

234
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,559
A divorce letter.

235
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,919
I can't serve two women
at the same time.

236
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,039
What are you talking about?

237
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,519
That's only an expedient measure.

238
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,919
Don't take it seriously.

239
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,360
Words said cannot be retrieved.

240
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,600
How can I not take it seriously?

241
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to get married.

242
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,039
I've no time for chats.

243
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,879
Get married?

244
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,960
You belong to me.

245
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,480
Moreover,

246
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,559
if I didn't have a plan,

247
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,919
do you think I'd let you
agree to marry her?

248
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,519
Empty rhetoric.

249
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,519
You have a plan?

250
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,159
Let's hear it then.

251
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,919
I already know where
the Night Shadow Pearl is.

252
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,320
As soon as I get it,

253
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,399
we can leave Mingyue Palace tonight.

254
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,960
So,

255
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,319
letting me marry her

256
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,480
is also part of the plan?

257
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,960
Of course.

258
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,000
I will never abandon you,

259
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,720
no matter when.

260
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,720
Moreover,

261
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,559
without you,

262
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,680
this plan could never be accomplished.

263
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,759
