10

=Episode 11=

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,039
He clearly promised my mother.

12
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,359
But then he betrayed her trust.

13
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,600
He caused the demise
of my father, mother, and sister.

14
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,880
After their deaths,
even their bodies could not be found.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,039
Hua Liancheng and the Yuanjiang people

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,520
are unforgivable,

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,680
but he, Shen Tianxing,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,599
definitely cannot escape culpability.

19
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,719
Are you referring to our master?

20
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,879
What?

21
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,359
You don't believe

22
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,120
that your master, the great healer

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,799
would do such a thing?

24
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,599
Senior,

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,680
we've been with Master for so long.

26
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,280
You should know
what kind of person he is.

27
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,040
Shen Tianxing is much more complicated
than you think.

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,239
When you have the chance,

29
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,920
go and ask him yourself

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,840
and find out what sort of person he is.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,200
I will get you out of here first.

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
What about you?

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,359
Quickly!

34
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,599
Stop right there!

35
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,719
Then let's perish together.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,840
Your master, Shen Tianxing,

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,599
stole our sacred treasure,
the Twelfth Night Splendor.

38
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,560
He promised my mother,

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,560
but then he betrayed her trust,

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,719
causing the demise
of my father, mother, and sister.

41
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,840
Your sister was also at this place...

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,879
Shut up!

43
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,639
After death,
even the corpses could not be found.

44
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,319
(Master is definitely not like this.)

45
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,080
(There must be some misunderstanding.)

46
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,680
(But,)

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,719
(what if it's true?)

48
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,919
I only left not long ago.

49
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,159
How did you protect her?

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,080
This meal hasn't been touched.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,439
It seems she hasn't had a bite again.

52
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,639
Go and get paper and pen.

53
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,400
Yes.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,439
Su Chenche?

55
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,439
Su Chenche?

56
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,328
(Meet your husband at the bridge.)

57
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,439
Dear,

58
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,039
happy birthday.

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
Today is my birthday?

60
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,199
Only my mother and Master
have celebrated it for me.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
How do you know?

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
In this world,

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,199
there is nothing
the Twelfth Night can't find out.

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,040
So,

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,639
the wealthy Twelfth Night Young Master,

66
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,680
is this all you're giving me as a gift?

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,839
Tell me

68
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,319
what do you want.

69
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,439
Anything.

70
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,319
I want the Huichun Valley to grow.

71
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,600
I want the children in Huichun Valley

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
to have new houses to live in.

73
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,560
And I wish...

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
I asked Shen Zhili,

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
not the Lord of Huichun Valley.

76
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,560
Today, on your birthday,

77
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,079
you can just be Shen Zhili.

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,720
Think about it.

79
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,639
What do you really want?

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
(I've never thought about)

81
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,319
(what the real Shen Zhili will be like.)

82
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,000
(What does she want to do?)

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,360
(What her wishes would be?)

84
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,360
When my mother was still alive,

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
my birthday wish

86
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,199
was for her illness to be cured.

87
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,160
So that

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
I could always be with her.

89
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,879
Unfortunately,

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,399
later, she...

91
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,399
Later, I went to Huichun Valley,

92
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,040
and met my master and senior.

93
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,360
They were like my family.

94
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,319
So I hoped they could be safe,

95
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,399
healthy,

96
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,240
and happy.

97
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,720
Sadly,

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
things didn't go that way.

99
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,319
Sometimes,

100
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,079
I feel like fate is toying with me.

101
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,079
So on my birthday today,

102
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,720
I suddenly miss them very much.

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,040
When my mother left, she told me

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,399
if I miss her,

105
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,600
I can look up at the stars.

106
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,759
The brightest one

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,240
would be her.

108
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,680
Dear, look.

109
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,360
Your gift.

110
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,480
Glowing stone?

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,480
Whenever you miss your mother,

112
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,079
take a look at it.

113
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,000
Dear,

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,560
did I make you unhappy?

115
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,680
I am happy.

116
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,240
You fool.

Dear,

00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to hear you say again

121
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,879
what you said that day.

122
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,720
That day?

123
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,079
I didn't say anything that day.

124
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,000
I think I have truly
fallen in love with you.

125
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,199
I didn't say which day it was.

126
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,879

127
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040

129
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,519
and rivers run dry,

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,600

135
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,559
Qing Xing, go get some hot water!

136
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,120
Okay.

137
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,159
Luckily, he has a heart armor.

138
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,279
The wound is only two inches
from the heart.

139
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,320
And the arrow was poisoned.

140
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,720
Within an hour,

141
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,879
the poisoned arrow must be removed.

142
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
Otherwise, the poison
will spread throughout the body.

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,960
Only one step remaining.

144
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,759
Maybe...

145
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,960
I'll do it.

146
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,679
Even until mountains are edgeless

147
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,799
and rivers run dry,

148
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,000
I would never part with you.

149
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:28,000
(Secret Prescription)

150
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,360
Senior,

151
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,799
your wounds have healed.

152
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,200
What are your plans next?

153
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,120
That's none of your business.

154
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,679
You're thinking of ways
to heal Su Chenche again.

155
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:48,399
You said that you haven't found
your family's remains.

156
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,200
Are you going to go...

157
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
Mind your own business.

158
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,799
I'm warning you,

159
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,120
Shen Tianxing, he...

160
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,200
Is the medicine almost ready?

161
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,519
Do you really like Su Chenche?

162
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,080
You and I have been healing people
since we were young.

163
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,159
This is the first time I've seen you

164
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,799
at a loss when faced with a patient.

165
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,600
Senior,

166
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,919
I practice medicine to save people.

167
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,720
But for the first time,
I've experienced the feeling of fear.

168
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,519
I'm afraid something will happen to him,

169
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,919
that I won't be able to save him,

170
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,399
even more afraid that from now on,

171
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,200
I may never see him again.

172
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,639
So...

173
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,360
Yes,

174
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,879
I like him.

175
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,039
A brat you haven't known for long,

176
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,279
can he really compete with

177
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,600
the bond between us of so many years?

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,799
Senior,

179
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,360
love cannot be measured by time,

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,559
nor can they be compared.

181
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
To me,

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,120
he is the source of my instant joy.

183
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,519
And the longer I'm with him,
the greater my affection grows.

184
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,279
That day in the prison cell,

185
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
you did not want me
to suffer as your sister did,

186
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,919
so you protected me at the risk
of your own life.

187
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,519
Do you see

188
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,919
your sister in me?

189
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,879
Mother!

190
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,679
Mother!

191
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Runing!

192
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,279
Please, save my little sister.

193
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,080
When I first arrived in Huichun Valley,

194
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,679
you gave me

195
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,000
the sweetest candied haws in the world.

196
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,519
At the moment I lost my family,

197
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,799
it was you and Master who told me

198
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,879
that in this world,

199
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,799
I'm never alone.

200
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,519
From that moment on,

201
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,559
I came to believe that

202
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
in this life,

203
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,759
you are my forever family.

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mother!

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,200
Please save my mother.

206
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,919
Take care on your way!

207
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,879
Hurry up and go, go!

208
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,120
Don't hinder my business.

209
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,159
(Yide Shop)
Come on.

210
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,399
Have some hot food.

211
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,440
Master,

212
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,080
this little girl is so pitiful.

213
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,679
I am Shen Tianxing from Huichun Valley.

214
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,679
Would you like to follow me
and learn medicine?

215
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,879
After learning medical skills,

216
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,600
you can help people like your mother.

217
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,080
I am willing to.

218
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,200
From now on, you must call me Master.

219
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,320
Yes, Master.

220
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,480
You're awake.

221
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,519
The medicine is about to cool.

222
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,360
Drink it now.

223
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,759
Here, eat this and it won't be bitter.

224
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,360
Family?

225
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,519
Family.

226
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,240
But only by getting married,

227
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,200
can we become a true family!

228
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:22,840
Senior,

229
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,440
family don't have
to be bonded by marriage

230
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,320
to grow old together.

231
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,480
In this world,
there is also a bond of siblinghood,

232
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,360
which cannot be separated or given up.

233
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,399
Senior,

234
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,080
I really want to become family with you.

235
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,720
From now on, let's support each other

236
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,879
and watch over each other.

237
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,159
What is this?

238
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,679
With your skill,

239
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,320
yet you wish to completely remove scars?

240
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
You must practice for three years.

242
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,559
Be careful.

243
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,279
Dear, what are you doing?

244
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,440
I have said

245
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,799
I won't let you be scarred.

246
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,720
Look at my poor memory.

247
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,960
I don't remember anything after a sleep.

248
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,919
When did you ever say these words?

249
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,360
Then you surely don't remember

250
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,919
I truly am in love with you.
