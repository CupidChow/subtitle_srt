=Episode 21=

11
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
Zhili.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,640
Zhili, how are you?

13
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,400
If you must protect her,

14
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,519
then I'll kill both of you.

15
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,640
Zhili, leave here first.

16
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,799
Leave now!

17
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,840
Just die.

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,159
Su Chenche, you can't die.

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,360
Zhili,

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
you still care about me.

21
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,639
No.

22
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,840
I just don't want to start over.

23
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,639
Zhili.

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,000
Lie down now.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,680
No need.

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,120
The arrow must be removed now.

27
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,919
Hang in there.

28
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,599
I can do it myself.

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,319
I know you're angry with me.

30
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,319
But don't take it out with your body.

31
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,680
If this wound isn't treated in time,

32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,000
your life will be in danger.

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,759
Wouldn't that be just what you want?

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,599
Well.

35
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,159
Don't remember it?

36
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,719
You stole my three core ingredients,
killed my senior,

37
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,400
and even killed me twice.

38
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,719
going to deny all these?

40
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,520
Zhili,

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,199
I didn't...

42
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,080
I didn't steal your core ingredients.
I didn't kill your senior.

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
And I didn't kill you.

44
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,199
It has started over.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,879
All traces of the past are gone.

46
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,599
You can say anything you want.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,000
But I only believe what I see.

48
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,039
I won't waste words on you.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,840
Just go.

50
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,400
Actually, I...

51
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,400
And,

52
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,400
I must get the Night Shadow Pearl.

53
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,719
If you stand in my way again,

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
I won't let you off.

55
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,159
This is for healing wounds.

56
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,560
This is for detoxification.

57
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,800
This is for neutralizing.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,800
I have all of these. Take them away.

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,959
You'd better keep them,

60
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,000
just in case.

61
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,120
Since you don't trust me,

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,120
then I will prove it to you.

63
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,000
Give me three days.

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,000
I will let you know the truth.

65
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,319
Okay.

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm waiting.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,839
I'm here to treat the master's headache.

68
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,000
Divine Physician Shen,
Young Master Su is inside.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,800
You can't enter without summoning.

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,600
The flowers in the garden
are in full bloom.

71
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,399
Accompany me to take a look.

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
(This is how you prove it.)

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,639
(Su Chenche, I underestimated you.)

74
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,839
Right, Young Master Su offered

75
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,000
a potent drug for treating headaches.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,040
I'm alright now.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,160
You're no longer needed here.

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,839
Yes.

79
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,519
(Sorry, Zhili.)

80
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,160
(I do this only to find the mastermind.)

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,800
(Catching him,)

82
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,519
(then you will believe me.)

83
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,480
(No matter what,)

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,000
(the three-day promise won't change.)

85
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,800
Thank you

86
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,279
for saving my life last night.

87
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,360
I didn't expect

88
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,160
the young master
saved from drowning last night

89
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,560
to be so handsome.

90
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,040
You were just awesome.

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,879
Upon making a move...

92
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,560
Shut up.

93
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,639
Talk too much.

94
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,839
Ji Mingyue said you drowned.

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,279
Don't you know how to swim?

96
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,360
You have the nerve to ask?

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,519
So you pretended to drown

98
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,600
to enter Mingyue Palace.

99
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
You knew the answer.

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,959
So you're here specifically for me.

101
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm concerned about Su Chenche.

102
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,319
What's going on between you and him?

103
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,360
What has he done to you?

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
For money or relationship?

105
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,600
For both!

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,519
How dare he harm my people?

107
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,839
Message from the main hall.

108
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,360
Ji Mingyue will host a banquet at noon

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,399
to celebrate newcomers
in Mingyue Palace.

110
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,639
Young master,

111
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,680
you sacrificed yourself
to get close to Ji Mingyue,

112
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,480
just to force that person to show up.

113
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,439
But now Hua Jiuye has intervened.

114
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,480
If he wins over Ji Mingyue,

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,360
our plan

116
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,839
may be disrupted.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
It's made according to the dress style

118
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,360
of your father in his youth.

119
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,000
If you wear this,

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm sure that in Ji Mingyue's eyes,

121
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,639
there's no space for others.

122
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,959
All the young masters in Mingyue Palace

123
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,680
bear some resemblance to Su Shenyan.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,319
If you want to win Ji Mingyue's favor,

125
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,480
you have to be more like him.

126
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,279
For example,

127
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,079
wear this white outfit.

128
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,319
But do not overdo it

129
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,639
like Young Master Xiaoye.

130
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Speaking of resemblance,

131
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,800
wouldn't Su Chenche be more like him?

132
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,279
Don't worry.

133
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,519
Your senior is here.

134
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,639
Even if Su Shenyan were still alive,

135
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,799
Ji Mingyue would only choose me.

136
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:41,856
(Mingyue Palace)

137
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,279
Young Master Hua arrives.

138
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,879
I knew that in white clothes,

139
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,360
you would look even more handsome.

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
Thank you, master.

141
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,816
Be seated.

142
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,799
Closer to me.

143
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,360
Since Physician Shen is your junior,

144
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,000
take a seat as well.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,320
Thank you, master.

146
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
Why aren't you in white?

147
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,159
My white clothes got stained.

148
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,519
I'll have more white outfits
prepared for you.

149
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,759
Remember.

150
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,159
In the Mingyue Palace,

151
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,759
you can only wear white outfits.

152
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,159
Yes.

153
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,399
Take a seat.

154
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,440
I'm counting on you for this.

155
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,840
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

156
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,200
Sorry, young master.

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,799
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

158
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,120
Now that everyone is here, let's start.

159
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,679
Don't take it to heart.

160
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,759
I just like seeing you in white.

161
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,200
You seem to have lost some weight.

162
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Have more food.

163
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,600
Thank you, master.

164
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,464
(No.)

165
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,159
(We must take the initiative.)

166
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,879
Master,

167
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,320
this tremella soup
is good for beauty and skin care.

168
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,080
Please try this.

169
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,799
Actually, the cook makes this every day.

170
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,440
But no matter how much tremella soup,

171
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,279
I can never be young.

172
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,519
Master, do not be sad.

173
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,759
Just a few rejuvenation pills

174
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
can help you regain youth.

175
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,399
Rejuvenation pill?

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,759
Does such miraculous pill really exist?

177
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,519
Master, you may not know.

178
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,320
My senior was born
in the royal family of Yuanjiang.

179
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,960
Rejuvenation pills are secret ones
of the royal family.

180
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,200
They do have
miraculous rejuvenation effects.

181
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,080
That's right.

182
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,559
To thank you for saving my life,

183
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,159
I'd like to offer rejuvenation pills,

184
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,519
only for you

185
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
to enjoy youth forever.

186
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,039
You are the most considerate.

187
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,279
I am very pleased.

188
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
(How about that?)

189
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,759
(This time I will surely defeat you.)

190
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,080
Have some fruit to cool it down.

191
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,559
Master, we've been talking for a while.

192
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,440
You must be thirsty.

193
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Have some fruit to moisten your throat.

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,519
Master,

195
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,440
besides taking the pills orally,

196
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,039
you also need to apply herbal medicine.

197
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,639
Except for me,

198
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,919
no one else can do it.

199
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,320
So?

200
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,840
Come and serve in the main hall tonight.

201
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,799
Zhili will come along.

202
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,519
Yes.

203
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Thank you, master.

204
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,480
Master,

205
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,559
here is the herbal remedy
I prepared for you.

206
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,919
Just have a good sleep.

207
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,559
Once you're up,

208
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,720
your skin will become smooth and tender.

209
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,320
Do not open your eyes.

210
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,279
Or fine wrinkles will catch up.

211
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,120
Got it.

212
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,360
Master.

213
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,559
Master.

214
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,440
Found it.

215
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,240
(This dragon pattern
is Su Chenche's jade toggle.)

216
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,039
What's wrong?

217
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,600
It was swapped by Su Chenche.

218
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,879
He should have got it.

219
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,399
Keep an eye on the master.

220
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,519
I'll go and settle this.

221
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,000
You finally showed up.

222
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
Today is your last day.

223
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,120
Su Chenche, stop.

224
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,080
Senior.

225
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,679
You want to kill him again?

226
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,919
I won't let you do it.

227
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,559
You.

228
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
You leave here first.

229
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,519
Zhili,

230
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,240
are you sure he is Hua Jiuye?

231
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,559
Hasn't he done enough disguises?

232
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,799
(There was that peculiar smell.)

233
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,600
(The smell is fading.)

234
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,759
(He)

235
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,759
(isn't...)

236
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
Here you are.

237
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,000
Senior.

238
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,720
(This is the real one.)

239
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,200
Senior, just now...

240
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,320
He was ambushed by someone.

241
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Ask him yourself.

242
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Young Master Hua.

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,159
Save me.

244
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,039
Save me, Young Master Hua.

245
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,519
(Zhili,)

246
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,320
(are you sure he is Hua Jiuye?)

247
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,159
(Hasn't he done enough disguises?)

248
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,960
Who can it be?

249
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,799
Who is he?

250
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,080
Su Chenche said

251
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,519
that he didn't swap the jade toggle.

252
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,279
He placed his own there.

253
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,360
Although we can't believe
everything he said,

254
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,039
it is possible

255
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,120
that the jade toggle
engraved with the phoenix

256
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,679
is still in Ji Mingyue's hands.

257
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
I'm asking you.

258
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,039
What's on your mind?

259
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,816
- What do we do next?
- What do we do next?

260
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:56,992
Senior,

261
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
I have a plan.

262
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,120
But I need your help.

263
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,159
(I planned to catch him)

264
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,000
(in Mingyue Palace within three days)

265
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,279
(to reveal the truth.)

266
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,159
(But now,)

267
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,759
(I haven't caught him.)

268
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,639
(I've even deepened
Zhili's misunderstanding.)

269
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,399
(How useless I am!)

270
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,159
Twelfth Night Young Master,

271
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,519
why are you so depressed?

272
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,159
Zhili asked you to come and stop me?

273
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,639
She went to Ji Mingyue alone?

274
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,360
Master,

275
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,919
my senior is a bit tired today.

276
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,240
I'll take over for him

277
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,519
for the following job.

278
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,400
I've no idea where Zhili goes,

279
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
or what she does.

280
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,160
But today you're going nowhere.

281
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,119
Don't you worry about her safety?

282
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,559
Alright, alright.

283
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,440
How long does the medicine take to work?

284
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,640
Rejuvenation pills are better.

285
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,839
Bring them over.

286
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Rejuvenation pills contain graphene.

287
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,960
It's harmful.

288
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,759
You can have it at most twice a month.

289
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,839
In my Mingyue Palace,

290
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,559
nobody dares to defy me.

291
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,440
Zhili has thorough plans.

292
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,160
She's gonna be fine.

293
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,599
The one with thorough plans
and meticulous thinking.

294
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,039
Quite typical of the current Zhili.

295
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,079
I've known Zhili for over a decade.

296
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,839
You've only known her for a few days.

297
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,200
How dare you call her Zhili?

298
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,079
(It seems that Zhili hasn't told him
about what happened before.)

299
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,839
(This is Hallucination Pill. With fire,
its scent can cause hallucinations.)
