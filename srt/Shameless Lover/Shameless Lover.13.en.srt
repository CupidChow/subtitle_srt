=Episode 13=

11
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,520
Horse Stance.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,399
Stabilize the Horse Stance.

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,039
(Du Yizhi, Hengshan Sect)
Power comes from the back foot.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,719
The Horse Stance must be stable.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,159
This is Du Yizhi, the senior disciple
of the Hengshan Sect.

16
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,408
He had exceptional martial arts talent.

17
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:06,000
Withdraw.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
He is the most accomplished disciple
of the sect leader, Master Du,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,519
one of the candidates for victory

20
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,959
in this martial arts tournament.

21
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,519
With his help,

22
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,239
our plan will be more successful.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,000
I've heard he has a bad temper.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,599
The Du family has a long-standing feud
with Lu Qinqin.

25
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,120
Exert force with the wrist.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,040
What should I do

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,239
to get close to him?

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,040
You all continue to practice.

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,239
(I still haven't thought of a reason.)

30
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,400
(What am I going to do?)

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,239
Lady Lu,

32
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,359
I have been waiting for you.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
It turns out you've long intended
to visit Lady Lu,

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,599
which is me.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
A blood feud is meaningless in itself.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,719
It's just the grievances of
the older generation.

37
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,239
It should not involve you and me.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
I've heard that although
you're in the temple,

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,439
your heart is with the martial world.

40
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,560
I truly admire it.

41
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,840
I also want to thank you

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,239
for giving me the opportunity
to know you.

43
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,800
(I should be the one thanking you)

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,039
(for giving me this chance.)

45
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,840
Be careful.

46
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,400
It's just a small thorn.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Don't worry about it.

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,520
This rose thorn can be pulled out.

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
But the color of your blood is too dark.

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,039
Perhaps there is a hidden heart issue.

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,319
I didn't expect that

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,719
you are proficient in medicine.

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,360
I once learned from a renowned master.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,719
So I have a little understanding.

55
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,400
My judgment was not wrong.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,240
I will prescribe you some medicine.

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,039
It's nothing serious.

58
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,840
Young master,

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
you just raised your eyebrow.

60
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,639
How could she understand what you mean?

61
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,199
(I'm dating other men behind his back?)

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,759
What does she mean by that?

63
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,120
She actually said
I have no right to be jealous.

64
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,719
Young Master Su.

65
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,400
How did these two start talking?

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,800
What's wrong?

67
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,919
Are you looking for me?

68
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,680
It's not like I came here on purpose.

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,360
On purpose?

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,919
Did you come here for me?

71
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,639
I...

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,000
So, are these flowers for me too?

73
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,479
(Strange.)

74
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,919
(Why isn't she coming over yet?)

75
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,759
(Could it be she didn't hear me?)

76
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,680
(Or she just isn't jealous at all.)

77
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
(She doesn't care.)

78
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,039
Forget it.

79
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,240
I'll go for a stroll with you.

80
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,520
You?

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,039
What are you doing here?

82
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,960
My husband's brother is handsome,
isn't he?

83
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,439
Indeed, he's very handsome.

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,120
It's just that

85
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
since I'm your sister-in-law,

86
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,920
if you want to meet with any girl,

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,959
you need to get my approval first.

88
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,759
After all, the elder sister-in-law
is like a mother.

89
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
(You're jealous.)

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
(But I don't think you have the right.)

91
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,839
(Unless you and I make it public.)

92
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,920
(That's true.)

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,439
(Though the elder sister-in-law
is like a mother,)

94
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,439
(after all, you are an adult.)

95
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,120
(So do whatever you want.)

96
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,399
(I won't meddle anymore.)

97
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,839
I must excuse myself.

98
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,839
Young Master Su,

99
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,680
how about I show you around?

100
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,399
I'm busy.

101
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
And I have to trouble you

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,160
to fetch
muscle-and-bone-strengthening powder.

103
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
Sure.

104
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,920
This medicine needs to be applied
every morning and evening.

105
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,720
This is...

106
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,959
I don't care what you want.

107
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,560
As for what I want to do,

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,560
please do not interfere.

109
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,120
Before my brother left,
he specially instructed me

110
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,439
to take good care of my sister-in-law.

111
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,160
Especially keeping an eye on you.

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Is that so?

113
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
But you rushed over there

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,839
after your brother passed away.

115
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,600
How did you hear his last wishes?

116
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,399
In a dream.

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,519
Is that not possible?

118
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,560
Young Master Su, this is not right.

119
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,040
Lady Lu's husband has passed away.

120
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,439
Do you want her to spend her life

121
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,879
in widowhood?

122
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,439
Anyway,

123
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,879
you must stay by my side.

124
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,920
Otherwise I will...

125
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,319
How can you threaten her?

126
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,959
She is from the martial arts world.

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,439
Why do you forcibly keep her here?

128
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,720
It's her life,

129
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
so she can make her own choices.

130
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,040
What do you mean?

131
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,319
I want to have a duel with you.

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,839
If I win,

133
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,399
you have to set her free.

134
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,319
The matter of my sister-in-law

135
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,439
is not your place to inquire about.

136
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,639
However,

137
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,439
I am not happy now.

138
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,000
So I'll just play along with you.

139
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,879
I used the sword technique
from your Du family,

140
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,040
and even gave you a three-move handicap.

141
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,680
How about that?

142
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,319
Are you convinced?

143
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,399
Stop it.

144
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,560
How dare you?

145
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,839
You even had Qing Xing deceive me
that the contest was at night.

146
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,800
If you really hurt him,

147
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,399
how can he go to
the Martial Arts Convention?

148
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,920
Are you okay?

149
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,759
Is it serious?

150
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,920
Do you need me to check it?

151
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,959
My old injury has recurred.

152
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,759
It hurts.

153
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,959
I will settle the score with you later.

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,319
Let's go.

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,319
Miss.

156
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:22,920
No.

157
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,800
Just take another look.

158
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,639
No entry without an invitation.

159
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,199
I must get in today.

160
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:33,504
(Wumo Villa)

161
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,839
The leading roles are here.

162
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,560
The great show should be set up now.

163
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
You spread the word
that Shen Zhili is in danger

164
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,240
to lure Hua Jiuye out.

165
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,439
What exactly do you want?

166
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,120
You just need to follow orders.

167
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,480
What's the use of all this talk?

168
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,319
Ma'am,

169
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,040
is this the only gate to Wumo Villa?

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,680
Yes, this is the only one.

171
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,319
Never mind,
there's no harm in telling you.

172
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,079
Have you heard that before fishing,

173
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,759
one should spread bait first?

174
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,839
Hua Jiuye,

175
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
Shen Zhili,

176
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,439
Su Chenche?

177
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,439
So you want to use him

178
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,439
to ultimately get to Su Chenche!

179
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:11,439
(Zhenbaoge Jewelry Store)

180
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,399
She's here.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,399
But if the two players meet
ahead of time,

182
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,560
and the fish eats all the bait,

183
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,399
I wonder how you would
continue this play

184
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,639
and the fishing.

185
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,959
That will depend on

186
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
whether you can do your job now.

187
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,600
Go.

188
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,279
(Ye Qianqian from the Cult.)

189
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
(She's here too.)

190
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Sir,

191
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,519
please get me some dried tangerine peel,

192
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,440
Chuanqiong and Xiangfu.

193
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,759
I'm truly sorry.

194
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,000
We are out of Xiangfu.

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,679
What about Xuanhu?

196
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,600
Muxiang or Zhike would also do.

197
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,399
Well, we don't have any of those.

198
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,360
This place is far from the city.

199
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,360
The herbs you just mentioned
are not commonly found here.

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,799
However, there is one herb available,

201
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,120
called Hongsharen,

202
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
whose effects are similar
to those of Xiangfu.

203
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,159
I have indeed seen Hongsharen
in medical texts,

204
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,000
but this herb is cold in nature.

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,159
It needs to be combined with

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
dried ginger.

207
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,360
Exactly.

208
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,159
Sir,

209
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,799
please pack these up for me.

210
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,639
Please wait a moment.

211
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,360
You are...

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,080
Talents everywhere.

213
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,519
I just don't know who he is.

214
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,159
(So this is how the Cult infiltrated.)

215
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,600
Young man.

216
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,759
What's the matter?

217
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,879
Young master,
shall I go look for Physician Shen?

218
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,679
Don't you dare!

219
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm telling you,

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
let alone go look for her,

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,679
even if she comes today,

222
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,000
she won't be able to come in!

223
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,639
Who is it?

224
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,440
It's me.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,480
How dare she come back?

226
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,360
Young master, I'll go drive her away.

227
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
Well.

228
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,279
Our young master said

229
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:56,960
he doesn't want...

230
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,840
Go away.

231
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,679
Get out.

232
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,519
You're here.

233
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,519
What are you here for?

234
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,799
To deliver medicine?

235
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,519
Yes.

236
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,600
It's just that

237
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,159
the prescription is myself.

238
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,759
Laugh if you want to.

239
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,720
Don't hold it in.

240
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,960
We are in-laws now.

241
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,600
But,

242
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,559
an occasional slip is also okay.

243
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,080
That's about enough.

244
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,519
Don't let others see.

245
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,600
I know you're doing all this

246
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
for the Ice Jade Bowl.

247
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
But I just can't stand it.

248
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,200
I can't stand Du Yizhi,

249
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,679
the way he looks at you.

250
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,759
I can't stand his every attempt
at courting you.

251
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,399
I wish I could tell the world now

252
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,759
that you are mine.

253
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,799
Then do you trust me?

254
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,919
A servant reported,

255
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,399
Su Chenche, at the moment,

256
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,039
is busy with the martial arts tournament

257
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,399
and can't get away for the time being.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,960
The wind is coming.

259
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,960
The show is about to begin.

260
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,320
Good!

261
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,200
This is Heart-protecting Pill.

262
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,960
It can protect your heart meridians

263
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
and stabilize your stamina,

264
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
so as to prevent accidents

265
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,120
due to physical reasons

266
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,200
during the competition.

267
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,000
(If all goes well,)

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,960
(Du Yizhi should make it
to the semi-final.)

269
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,080
(I need to find out)

270
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,200
(who are all the opponents,)

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,559
(so we can be more confident.)

272
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,960
Look.

273
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
You are really beautiful.

274
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,240
Play for a while, won't you?

275
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,919
Let go of me.

276
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,840
You, a young widow,

277
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,000
pretending to be loyal?

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,879
Don't go. Play with me a little longer.

279
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,399
Keep me company.

280
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,320
You want to die?

281
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,279
Why are you here?

282
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,360
The news is indeed correct.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,120
You are truly in danger.

284
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
Who is Lu Qinqin?

285
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,200
(Why did he say I am in danger?)

286
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
(And,)

287
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,519
(who brought him the message?)

288
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,320
I...

289
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,759
The one mentioned by Right Guardian
has appeared.

290
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,399
We shall act according to the plan.

291
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,120
Who are you?

292
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,360
You don't even

293
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,799
deserve to know my name.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,320
I see.

295
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,000
Hey,

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,799
everyone.

297
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,519
The other day, I have seen him

298
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,320
with Ye Qianqian.

299
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,159
He must be a member of the Cult.

300
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,200
A person from the Cult?

301
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,799
How could the Cult...

302
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,200
How dare someone from the Cult

303
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,080
intrude on the Martial Arts Convention?

304
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,799
We must not let him go.

305
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,600
Capture him.

306
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,559
Right, capture him.

307
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,200
Capture him.

308
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,960
Get him!

309
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,799
Take him!

310
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,039
Senior!

311
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,720
There's been a murder.

312
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,120
The Cult has committed murder.

313
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,200
Take him!

314
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,159
The Cult has committed murder!

315
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,279
(Why are they so eager)

316
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,200
(to label us as people of the Cult?)

317
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,919
(Why must make things big?)

318
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,960
(Cult, Martial Arts Convention?)

319
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,360
(Could it be that I'm not the target)

320
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
(but Su Chenche instead?)

321
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,159
Let's see who dares to lay a hand
on my people.

322
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,879
Leave it to me.

323
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,639
Young Master Su,

324
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,399
you seem to know

325
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,120
these two long ago, right?

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,919
Of course.

327
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,240
That is to say,

328
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,120
Shen Zhili got in
under the name of Lu Qinqin,

329
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,679
and then, in front of everyone,

330
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,559
pretended to be your sister-in-law.

331
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,600
This was agreed upon by you, right?

332
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,399
Of course.

333
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,879
This...

334
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,600
Disregards the rules, deceives people.

335
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
What right do you have

336
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,039
to host this Martial Arts Convention?

337
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,759
You was with Ye Qianqian before,

338
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,840
and now your sister-in-law
and the Huichun Valley...

339
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Such a fickle-hearted person you are.

340
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,559
On what grounds

341
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,480
can you be the witness
of the Martial Arts Convention?

342
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Exactly.

343
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,759
That's right.

344
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,000
Exactly so.

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,120
Why?

346
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,639
Quickly disassociate yourself from me.

347
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,159
If you guys

348
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
feel that I am unqualified

349
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,879
to host this Martial Arts Convention,

350
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,240
I will step down.

351
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,360
However, I hope that everyone present

352
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,799
can understand one thing.

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,799
Shen Zhili from Huichun Valley

354
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,759
is the one and only love of my life.

355
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,159
Is it worth it, for me?

356
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,200
For you,

357
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,720
everything is worth it.

358
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,435
(Wumo Villa)

359
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,559
Today's events are suspicious.

360
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,480
It's the work of the Cult's spies.

361
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,720
Rest assured, dear.

362
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,639
I have made arrangements.

363
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,640
I'm sorry,

364
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,759
it's my fault.

365
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,480
You want the Ice Jade Bowl.

366
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,640
I don't want another man to help you.

367
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,960
Losing this identity

368
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,279
seems to be a loss,

369
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,519
but it gave me an opportunity.

370
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,599
I want to personally
get the Ice Jade Bowl for you.

371
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,920
Then I want to help you

372
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,759
to reclaim the glory
of the Twelfth Night.

373
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Then I must properly thank you.

374
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,984
♪If we separate♪

375
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,377
♪Just one step away
