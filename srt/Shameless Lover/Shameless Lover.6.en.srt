10

=Episode 6=

11
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,880
Oh, my dear.

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,680
I've grown old.

13
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,079
For me,

14
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,760
you're the most beautiful
woman in the world.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
So what?

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
He doesn't think that way.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,560
Master.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,120
Why can't you just let go?

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,560
How could I easily let go

20
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
someone I've truly loved?

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
I prepared this twenty years ago.

22
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,560
Today it will finally serve its purpose.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,560
You are nervous?

24
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,400
I just fear it won't go as planned.

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,560
Don't worry.

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
I won't let her do anything to you.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Dear.

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
Compared to my life,

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,800
you are more concerned
about my chastity,

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,599
is that so?

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,960
No.

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,199
Of course not.

33
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,560
Your life

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,039
is what matters the most.

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,879
Dear.

36
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,159
You've grown feelings for me.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,039
Young Master Su.

38
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,960
The Master has asked for you.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,080
Be careful.

40
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,120
Dear.

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,319
Both my life

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
and my chastity

43
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,479
are yours.

44
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,240
(The most important thing is
to obtain the Night Shadow Pearl.)

45
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,719
(Yes, the Night Shadow Pearl.)

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,832
Master.

47
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,560
I'll take my leave then.

48
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,680
Go.

49
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,399
Master.

50
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,199
You look quite obedient

51
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,879
today.

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,079
As I should be.

53
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,439
After tonight,

54
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,920
I will belong to you.

55
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,399
I believe that the Night Shadow Pearl

56
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,480
is in the stone forest
in the back courtyard.

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,879
To open the secret chamber door
in the stone forest,

58
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,240
I need the jade toggle
on Ji Mingyue's hand.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,079
Yin and Yang, Dragons and Phoenixes.

60
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,480
That should be the key.

61
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,040
Jade toggle.

62
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,000
According to the custom,

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,480
for today's wedding,

64
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,519
I should give you a family heirloom.

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,120
This still exists?

66
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,600
My father passed it down to me.

67
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,160
It must be

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,920
of great importance to him.

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,079
It appears

70
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,800
to match well

71
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,759
with what you have on your hand.

72
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,639
One is a dragon,

73
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,000
and the other is a phoenix.

74
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,639
They are a pair.

75
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,120
You can't do without this

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,319
when practicing archery.

77
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
What is this?

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,079
(A pair of dragon and phoenix
jade toggles from my family.)

79
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,480
(Since you accepted it,)

80
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,160
(you can never leave me.)

81
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,120
It's almost time.

82
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,399
The ceremony is about to begin.

83
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,560
Master,

84
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
I will go prepare myself.

August lily.

00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,720
It's this man again.

111
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,240
(Why are his two eyes different?)

112
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,040
This smell...

113
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,519
Secret chamber.

114
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,039
This man is Su Shenyan.

115
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,559
The only person the Master ever loved.

116
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
You were following me?

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,440
You're here to steal
the Night Shadow Pearl,

118
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
so this is the only place you'll go.

119
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
The stone forest in the back courtyard.

120
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
You used this information to lure me?

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Once you get the Night Shadow Pearl,

122
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
leave immediately.

123
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Don't worry.

124
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,919
We won't compete with you
for the Master.

125
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,600
Everyone knows that
the Mingyue Palace has a unique treasure

126
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,679
called the Night Shadow Pearl.

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
All red in color, like a blood drop.

128
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Carrying it can double one's power.

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,240
It is also a precious
medicinal ingredient

130
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,320
that has life-saving effects.

131
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,320
Yet few people know

132
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,279
that this pearl does not belong
to Mingyue Palace at All.

133
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,639
Not only that,

134
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,559
Mingyue Palace was only established

135
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,480
for it.

136
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,759
What does it mean?

137
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,000
It is a spiritual stone
bred by the mountain.

138
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,279
If an ordinary person touches it,

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,120
it will appear as a piece

140
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,399
of ordinary stone.

141
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,720
For decades now,

142
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
not a single person could make it

143
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,679
reveal its true color,

144
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,080
let alone take it away.

145
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,200
In this world,

146
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
few are special.

147
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,919
Does it hurt?

148
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,399
(Shen Tianxing, Late Lord
of Huichun Valley)

149
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,159
Zhili,

150
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,720
you must remember

151
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,919
that you were born
at the yin time of the yin year,

152
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,919
a person of utmost yin.

153
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,639
Not only your blood is colder,

154
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,759
but you'll also have a harder time
to stop bleeding.

155
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
You must be extra careful.

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,639
Do you understand?

157
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Master,

158
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,240
is there a way to change it?

159
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
Silly kid.

160
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,639
Why should you change it?

161
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,960
There are a lot of people

162
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
who'd die for

163
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,600
a constitution like yours.

164
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,559
It enables you

165
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,720
to distinguish more scents

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
than average people.

167
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,159
And there are

168
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,039
many rare mountain stone-type medicines

169
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,720
that require this utmost yin blood
for identification.

170
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
It's a great ability.

171
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,639
Master.

172
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,759
It's midnight.

173
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,720
Get out, all of you.

174
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,200
Yes.

175
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,320
You.

176
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,120
Come here.

177
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,759
Your eyes can only look at me.

178
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,559
Give it back.

179
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,679
It really is so.

180
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,519
(The pearl has brightened.)

181
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,240
Leave now.

182
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,320
The cave is about to collapse.

183
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,159
Why is he...

184
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,559
Oh no.

185
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,320
The Night Shadow Pearl!

186
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,679
Master.

187
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Where are you going

188
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,720
leaving your groom all alone?

189
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,679
Out of my way.

190
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,000
My father...

191
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,399
He's here?

192
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
He won't be here.

193
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,399
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

194
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,879
Disappointed?

195
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,519
Does he still resent me

196
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,159
for injuring his eyes with arrows?

197
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,039
So it's been a long time
since you left this place last time.

198
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,200
You never heard

199
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,679
that my father passed away

200
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,600
five years ago?

201
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,399
That's not possible.

202
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
He hasn't apologized to me yet,

203
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,000
nor has he come to marry me.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,399
How could he just die?

205
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:46,960
How could he just die?

206
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,960
Why should he apologize to you?

207
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,399
And why should he marry you?

208
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,639
My father only ever loved my mother.

209
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,399
Even on his deathbed,

210
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,320
the name he uttered
was that of my mother.

211
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,919
Shen Jiyue?

212
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,159
Right.

213
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,799
That witch.

214
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,120
She took Su Shenyan away from me.

215
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,480
She stole all his love for me!

216
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,600
My father never loved you.

217
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,919
He didn't resent you, either.

218
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,120
Ji Mingyue.

219
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,720
(Su Shenyan, Father of Su Chenche)
I never had romantic feelings for you.

220
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:30,840
That's not true.

221
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,679
You're lying!

222
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,720
He did love me.

223
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,440
He had always loved me.

224
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,200
You are lying!

225
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,399
Su Shenyan.

226
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,320
Shenyan.

227
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
Shenyan.

228
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,519
Shenyan.

229
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,399
Shenyan.

230
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,440
Come out.

231
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,600
Why don't you come to marry me?

232
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,320
Su Shenyan.

233
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
Get out of here!

234
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,320
I understand now.

235
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,679
You are all the same.

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Su Chenche.

237
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,159
Watch out!

238
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,759
Zhili!

239
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm fine.

240
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,559
You are breaking with me
over this witch?

241
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,320
Ji Mingyue.

242
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,960
I never had romantic feelings for you.

243
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you hurt?

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm fine.

245
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,639
But you...

246
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,759
Did you forget?

247
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,399
I'm wearing the protective armor.

248
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,399
(I spent my whole life for you.)

249
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,320
(In the end,)

250
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,600
(it's all in vain.)

251
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,200
(Su Shenyan.)

252
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,679
(You have let me down in this life.)

253
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,279
(I will never forgive you.)
