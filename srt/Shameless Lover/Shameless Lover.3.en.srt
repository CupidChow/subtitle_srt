Stand in your place.

12
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,599
(The master really likes me the best.)

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,200
(It seems I've got this.)

14
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,719
(No.)

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,400
It's been two days already.

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,200
I've searched the entire main hall

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,560
but still haven't found it.

18
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,760
The day before yesterday,
she shot arrows while we stood.

19
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,159
Yesterday, she shot while we knelt.

20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,680
Today, she had us running.

21
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,319
This woman

22
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,599
is truly perverse.

23
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,439
This Mingyue Palace

24
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,400
also looks very dangerous.

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,159
Traps are everywhere.

26
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,120
Nowhere is safe.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,400
The most dangerous place

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,159
is the safest.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,439
Could it be

30
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,439
in her bedroom chamber?

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,159
I've made her really mad today.

32
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,719
She probably won't ask for me again.

33
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,000
No.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,680
You have to endure it one last time.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,439
Tonight,

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,360
I will take you

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,080
to her side.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,479
Dear.

39
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,560
What are you doing?

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,080
If you want to please someone,

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,879
you must learn to

42
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,919
let go of your dignity.

43
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,479
How am I supposed to do that?

44
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,919
In one word.

45
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,960
Obey.

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,159
In two words.

47
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,000
Completely obey.

48
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,240
Do not ask the other person

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,639
what they are going to do.

50
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,319
Then I...

51
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,680
And do not ask

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,759
what you should do.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,599
Yes.

54
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,919
Dear.

55
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,919
Why are you sacrificing yourself for me?

56
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,879
You don't even know

57
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,879
why I came to the Mingyue Palace.

58
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,280
The greatest treasure
of the Mingyue Palace

59
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,719
is the Night Shadow Pearl.

60
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,000
You must be here for it too.

61
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,759
I wanted to keep it from you.

62
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,919
You already knew?

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,919
It must be my fault

64
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,759
if you don't trust me.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,960
Don't blame yourself.

66
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,240
However,

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,759
Ji Mingyue

68
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,800
is ruthless and vicious.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,759
If she were to strangle me to death...

70
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,199
Death is not an option.

71
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,800
Otherwise, I'd have to start over.

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,919
What I meant is,

73
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,080
on the issue of life and death,

74
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,960
we must seize

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,439
the initiative.

76
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,639
What should we do

77
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,000
to both please her

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,879
and maintain the initiative?

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,279
All the young masters know

80
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,759
that Ji Mingyue will
choose her man today

81
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
by bathing with them together.

82
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,959
So, we need to practice

83
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
so that she will choose you.

84
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,519
Okay.

85
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,199
Dear.

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,480
Pleasing her in ways she likes

87
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,000
will enable you to take

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,279
the initiative.

89
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,279
How should I please her?

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
I'll teach you.

91
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
Have you learned?

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,439
Dear.

93
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,560
You also like

94
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,839
this kind of pleasing, right?

95
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,439
Let go of me.

96
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,519
What are you doing?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,240
Su Chenche.

98
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,000
What are you doing?

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,319
Dear.

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,959
You also can't swim.

101
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,160
How about

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
we end the practice here?

103
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Young masters.

104
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
Our master is in a bad mood today.

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,879
So serve her well.

106
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,839
Let's start with

107
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,079
Young Master Su.

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Please move to the bedchamber.

109
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll stall for time in the bedchamber.

110
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,360
Okay.

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
I'll go search in the main hall.

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,000
(He has sacrificed so much.)

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,519
(If I can't find anything,)

114
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,120
(it'd all be in vain.)

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,399
(Secret room? Great.)

116
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,016
Don't move.

117
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,279
Tell me who sent you.

118
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,600
Young Master Xiaoye?

119
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,839
What are you doing?

120
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,600
I know

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
what you're doing in private.

122
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,920
We?

123
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,360
You and Su Chenche.

124
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,879
You should be more than
just brothers, right?

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
(He discovered us?)

126
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,480
Don't think I don't know

127
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,360
what you are plotting.

128
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
(Then I can't let you live.)

129
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,879
You want to become
the master's favored consort?

130
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,960
See?

131
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,319
You're lashing out in anger

132
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,639
for being seen through.

133
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,199
You even want to hit me.

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,439
I am the number one young master
of the Mingyue Palace.

135
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,160
Don't even dream

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,519
of taking my place.

137
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,279
You're so right.

138
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,720
We were just

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,279
blinded by all the wealth.

140
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,920
Please show mercy, Young Master Xiaoye.

141
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
Grant us a reprieve.

142
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,560
You must leave the Mingyue Palace
within three days.

143
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,759
Otherwise,

144
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,919
I won't be so polite.

145
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,639
Dear, you're back.

146
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,519
Where have you been?

147
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,440
Did it go well?

148
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,120
Right.

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,399
Have you had dinner?

150
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,040
Come here.

151
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,679
I have prepared osmanthus cake,
crispy pastries,

152
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,519
and lotus seed soup for you.

153
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Have this first.

154
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,080
You're injured?

155
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
I'm fine.

156
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,120
Let's eat first.

157
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,320
What did she do to you?

158
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,200
That was a nice bath.

159
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,200
And I like

160
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,399

Isn't this what you want?

164
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,080
Master?

165
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,200
It's nothing.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Just a minor injury.

167
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,000
I can take it.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,480

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,679
It was Young Master Su.

194
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,480
What?

195
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,840
They are still here?

196
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,720
Su Chenche, Shen Zhili.

197
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,919
Then don't blame me for this.

198
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,480
Young Master.

199
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,679
That is the red egg
gifted to you by the Master.

200
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,200
Why didn't you remind me earlier?

201
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
I'm done for.

202
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,840
My egg.

203
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,759
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

204
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,519
Maybe you should

205
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,799
let her excuse you.

206
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,039
No need to worry.

207
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,679
My wounds have mostly healed.

208
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,399
Moreover,

209
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,679
this is a rare opportunity.

210
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,200
Then be smarter this time.

211
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,679
Protect yourself.

212
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,399
Dear.

213
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,039
How should I protect myself?

214
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,879
If she gets any ideas about you,

215
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,000
stab her Fengchi acupoint.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,960
A single jab will knock her out.

217
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
This is your medical toolkit.

218
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,840
How could I use it to harm anyone?

219
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,639
Then get her drunk with wine.

220
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,080
That should be fine, right?

221
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,879
How?

222
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,200
First,

223
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,399
charm her

224
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
with your handsome face.

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
And then,

226
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,399
take her hand onto your arm and say,

227
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,360
Master,

228
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,360
let's have a drink together.

229
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
While drinking,

230
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,480
pour your wine away.

231
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,360
You see?

232
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,159
Yes.

233
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,360
Come on, give it a try.

234
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,600
Good times are hard to come by.

235
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,720
Deep affection is paid off with wine.

236
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,519
Dear.

237
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,799
Let's have a drink together.

238
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,039
That's not right.

239
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,639
You can't call her "Dear".

240
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,000
(Wait.)

241
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,080
(Why should I mind that?)

242
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,080
Dear.

243
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,120
Why did you drink first?

244
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,399
Forget it, let's try again.

245
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,528
I...

246
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,840
I have this...

247
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
Antidote for alcohol.

248
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
You take it one hour...

249
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
No, six hours in advance.

250
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,879
Then you can drink without issue.

251
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,200
Also,

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,159
pill for refreshment,

253
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,480
pill for pain-relieving,

254
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,559
powder for blood replenishing,

255
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,519
take all of these.

256
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,080
(These pills are quite valuable.)

257
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,519
(What's wrong with me?)

258
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,399
You are always so good to me.

259
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,216
(Never mind.)

260
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,400
(His safety)

261
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
(is what matters the most now.)

262
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,279
These medicines

263
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,120
will also benefit your body.

264
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,519
Once you have recovered,

265
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,840
you will have more energy

266
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,159
to deal with Ji Mingyue.

267
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,519
Okay.

268
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,080
Oh, and...

269
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,159
You...

270
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,559
Young Master Su, are you ready?

271
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,480
It's time.

272
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll go now, dear.

273
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,159
You must protect yourself.

274
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,519
Rest assured.

275
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,279
I won't die.

276
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,759
