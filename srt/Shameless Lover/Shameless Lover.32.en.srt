=Episode 32=

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,960
So I want to become a good healer

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,560
to cure patients,

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,520
to protect you even more.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,520
But I've only just now realized

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,359
that all of this

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,920
is fake.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,039
Our past together was not fake.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
You can always call me Master.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,719
Master,

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
I thought

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,480
we could go on like this forever,

22
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,519
spend a lifetime in Huichun Valley,

23
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,799
healing the sick, saving lives,

24
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,519
relying on each other.

25
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,560
Wasn't that good enough for us?

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,840
Why must you be so obsessed
with Twelfth Night Splendor?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Why be so cruel to me?

28
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,640
Why?

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,760
I can't let go of Jiyue.

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,439
I can't let go for my entire life.

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,760
You have to understand me.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
Understand you?

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Understand

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,680
that you treat me like a pawn?

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,560
You've deceived me time and again,

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,200
used me,

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,640
even harmed the people
most important to me,

38
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,280
turning all my dependence
and trust in you

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,879
into a sharp blade,

40
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,760
raising it without hesitation
when you need it,

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,879
toward everyone,

42
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,479
and then discard it
without a trace of guilt?

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,479
Is that so?

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,759
Even if it is, so what?

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,879
I raised you up.

46
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,840
Whatever I tell you to do,

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,479
you have to do it.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,479
I will not let you have your way.

49
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,560
You really have grown up,

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,360
daring to defy me.

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,560
Aren't you afraid I'll kill Su Chenche

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,840
and let you experience
losing a loved one?

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
You're so persistent about this,

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,479
but don't know that
Twelfth Night Splendor has two seeds.

55
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,240
With this one only,

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,840
you can't do anything.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,240
If you really kill Su Chenche,

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,280
you'll never be able to bring back

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,159
Shen Jiyue.

60
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,520
Zhili?

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,560
Zhili?

62
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,240
(Memorial Tablet of Mother Shen Jiyue)
Mother

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,639
Shen Jiyue.

64
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,080
Chenche.

65
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,840
Chenche.

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,479
Mother?

67
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,319
Never expected my son

68
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,719
to have grown so much.

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
You're finally here.

70
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,599
Are you here to save me?

71
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,199
You will me, right?

72
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,719
You must save me.

73
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,639
Chenche, please save me.

74
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,159
Chenche!

75
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,360
Chenche!

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,159
(Mother,)

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
(wait for me.)

78
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,800
(Chenche, come here.)

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,120
(Come to Mother.)

80
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,079
Su Chenche, don't!

81
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,240
You smelled the Soul-bewitching Incense

82
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,120
and entered into an illusion.

83
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,040
Zhili,

84
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,959
I just saw my mother.

85
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,519
I really saw my mother just now.

86
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,680
Let's go and save her, Zhili.

87
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,759
Even if you don't consider
our relationship as Master and disciple,

88
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,759
for his sake,

89
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,519
you must revive Shen Jiyue.

90
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,279
Right,

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,839
Zhili?

92
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,639
Okay.

93
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,319
I promise you.

94
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,000
Su Chenche.

95
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,839
You!

96
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,120
I always

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,319
make sure I succeed.

98
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,759
Let's go.

99
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,439
Be careful.

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,519
(This cave is like the illusion
just now.)

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Mother.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Mother!

103
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,399
Mother!

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,279
Get things done now.

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Drive the Gold Osmanthus Toad

106
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,800
out of your body.

107
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
What if I tell you

108
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,439
the Twelfth Night Splendor
cannot revive her?

109
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
What tricks are you playing now?

110
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,240
Two drops of blood, Twin flowers.

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Yin and Yang seeds,
transform into Yin and Yang.

112
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,399
Yin and Yang are ready,
the material transforms.

113
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
Thus, life begins.

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,319
Yin and Yang move

115
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,439
from beginning to end.

116
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,319
This is a secret phrase
of the Imperial Yuanjiang family.

117
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,120
What does it mean?

118
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,480
The world believes
Twelfth Night Splendor

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
can bring back the dead,

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
but in reality,

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it merely traps people in a time loop.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,120
It's a curse.

123
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,720
All people are fools.

124
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,399
I only trust myself.

125
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,199
Twelfth Night Splendor can save people.

126
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,879
It does not just save people,

127
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,920
but also enhances my power.

128
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
In due time,

129
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,079
I will travel the world with Jiyue,

130
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,439
make her the supreme woman of the world.

131
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,959
The Supreme of the World?

132
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,079
Everything you do

133
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,399
is for your own sake.

134
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,680
I thought all you did

135
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,000
was for nothing more than love,

136
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,879
unexpectedly,

137
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,800
you are so selfish and self-serving.

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,160
Killing two birds with one stone,
why not?

139
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,639
I've been planning for over a decade,

140
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,399
raising you as a blood bag,

141
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,800
having you collect core ingredients.

142
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,319
All for today.

143
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,680
Cut the talk, give me
the Gold Osmanthus Toad.

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,639
Otherwise,

145
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,199
I will kill him right now.

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,879
Why has it come to this?

147
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,120
I have long said

148
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,519
that when I do things,

149
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,959
I tend to make sure.

150
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,320
It's these flowers.

151
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,639
My good disciple,

152
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,600
you are one move short in the game.

153
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,279
But I am very grateful to you.

154
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,879
The Yuanjiang secret phrase
you just mentioned

155
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,080
finally clears up my confusion.

156
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,480
So resurrection and the growth of power

157
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,360
require two seeds.

158
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,399
Yin and Yang constitution.

159
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,879
Yin and Yang seeds.

160
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,840
Interesting.

161
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,720
You should stop being so obstinate.

162
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
Twelfth Night Splendor

163
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,720
it's not at all what you think.

That's right.

172
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Just like that.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
Why has it stopped?

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,679
Why did it stop?

175
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,720
The blood has dried.

176
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,080

He will definitely try to separate us.

181
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,720
If so,

182
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,559
let's just play along.

183
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,120
You and Senior go deal with the others.

184
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,279
I'll meet him.

185
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,279
No way.

186
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,600
That's too dangerous.

187
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,799
Have you forgotten

188
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,759
he killed you previously?

189
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,559
Indeed.

190
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,159
If he kills me again,

191
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,480
we'll have to go through
another time reset.

192
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,879
Time can be reset.

193
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,320
Yin and Yang can be interchanged.

194
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,720
There is Yang within Yin,

195
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,799
Yin within Yang.

196
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,639
Does that mean

197
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,840
the beginning is the end,
the end is the beginning?

198
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,600
We now know

199
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,240
you have the supreme Yang blood,

200
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
and I have the supreme Yin blood.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,576
Drop the supreme Yang blood
and supreme Yin blood respectively on

202
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:22,944
the Yang seed and the Yin seed
of Twelfth Night Splendor,

203
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,800
only then was the time reset initiated.

204
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,720
So,

205
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,120
we just need to drip our blood

206
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,440
onto the seeds again

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,799
to close the time reset.

208
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,320
No.

209
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,120
We need to swap the two seeds.

210
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,639
Drip the supreme Yang blood
onto the Yin seed,

211
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,679
supreme Yin blood onto the Yang seed.

212
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,720
Thus, we can completely close it.

213
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
So this time, we have two objectives.

214
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,639
One, find your mother,

215
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,120
Shen Jiyue's body,

216
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,919
Two, retrieve the Twelfth Night Splendor

217
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,279
and completely break the time loop.

218
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,039
Let's do it together.

219
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:11,168
♪The end is also the beginning♪

220
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
Take the antidote pill.

221
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,440
No.

222
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,200
She is mine.

223
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,240
- Wait.
- No.

224
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,919
You can't take her!

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,799
(Master,)

226
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,960
(in this life,)

227
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
(we part ways from here.)

228
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,600
Senior,

229
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,240
the flowers in the courtyard
have bloomed.

230
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,639
If you like them, they're yours.

231
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,919
(Jiyue.)

232
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,919
(I'm sorry.)

233
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,240
Young master,

234
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,960
let me help you.

235
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,759
No need.

236
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,840
I have led the troops
to conquer the Cult.

237
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,159
All their members have been dealt with.

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,120
All of this has finally ended.

239
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,720
Where is my senior?

240
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,759
He heard that you and my young master
are unharmed,

241
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,799
and was relieved.

242
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,200
He asked me to bring you a letter.

243
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,039
(Zhili,)

244
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,000
(you know I've never liked farewells.)

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,600
(The world is small.)

246
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,519
(Perhaps we may meet again soon.)

247
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,559
(Our past filled with entanglements.)

248
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,440
(now we have regained our freedom)

249
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,960
(and have good people by our sides.)

250
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,840
(I hope you an easy)

251
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,759
(and happy life from now on.)

252
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,799
(Hua Jiuye)

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,320
(Senior, I'll see you again.)

254
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,559
It seems that he

255
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,720
has gone to enjoy the world
with Ye Qianqian.

256
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,840
That's good.

257
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,159
As long as I know he's still around,

258
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,440
I am at ease.

259
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,320
I will always be by your side.

260
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,279
Forever.

261
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,360
If you stay by my side forever,

262
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,559
what about Twelfth Night?

263
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,679
The Cult is eradicated.

264
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,960
Vengeance is served.

265
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,799
Dawn has broken.

266
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,960
Twelfth Night should be disbanded.

267
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,480
What about you?

268
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
Continue being Physician Shen?

269
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,240
Perhaps.

270
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,840
All along,

271
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,600
reviving my master is my faith,

272
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,440
staying in Huichun Valley
is my commitment.

273
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,919
Master is the reason I cannot part
with these.

274
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,399
But it's only now that I've realized

275
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,039
all of this was chosen

276
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,200
by me, Shen Zhili.

277
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,559
What about me?

278
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,639
It was your existence

279
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
that made me understand this.

280
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,240
So,

281
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,000
I decided to reward you

282
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
by letting you stay by my side forever.

283
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,120
Are you willing?

284
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,919
I couldn't ask for more.

285
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:30,272
(One month later)

286
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,720
My lord, you're here.

287
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,759
Come on.

288
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,759
Greetings, my lord.

289
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,320
Greetings.

290
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,440
Good.

291
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,919
Study well. The tuition is expensive.

292
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,039
Understood.

293
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,200
Greetings.

294
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,840
Good.

295
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,360
Greetings.

296
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,000
Good.

297
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,240
Greetings.

298
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Sit down quickly.

299
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,000
Let me tell you, you must study hard.

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,359
Isn't this our new village chief?

301
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,392
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

302
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,864
- Good to see you too.
- Greetings.

303
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,519
Nowadays,

304
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,440
with so many new roles,

305
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,960
would you mind including Mrs. Su's role?

306
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
So many roles,

307
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,440
I'm overwhelmed.

308
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,599
Let's talk about it later.

309
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,039
When exactly is this "later"?

310
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,519
The wedding attire will
be out of fashion soon!

311
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,400
What did you say?

312
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,119
Su Chenche!

313
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:52,920
What?

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,240
Tomorrow is an auspicious time/

315
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,519
What about tomorrow?

316
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,640
Qing Xing, prepare for the wedding!

317
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,720
