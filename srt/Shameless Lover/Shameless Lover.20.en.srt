10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,648
=Episode 20=

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,640
Mingyue Palace is in deep forests,
humid with rains.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,880
After entering the palace, your symptoms

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,640
will only become worse.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,560
Need not worry though.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,799
May I take your pulse?

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,200
Just wait quietly for a moment.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,599
Well.

18
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,959
Please.

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,840
It's done.

20
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,040
The rashes are gone.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,079
As long as you
bring me into the palace...

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,959
Really gone.

23
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,359
I will ensure your good health.

24
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,840
And also boost your personal charm.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm sure the master will like it.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,920
I've long heard of a great physician
in the Huichun Valley.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,719
Today I can confirm your reputation.

28
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,760
Then you'll be my personal physician.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,799
Follow me into the palace.

30
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,879
Alright.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,319
Hold on.

32
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,840
Young Master Xiaoye,

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,560
I advise you to have a second thought.

34
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,080
What do you mean?

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,120
Young Master Xiaoye,

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,560
you bring such a woman into the palace.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,159
Do you think Ji Mingyue will be happy?

38
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,719
I can disguise myself as a man.

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,759
Then Physician Shen must know

40
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,639
that disguising as a man

41
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,520
will be discovered sooner or later.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,560
But I can not only
help you improve your health,

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
but also make the master more beautiful,

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,479
in your name!

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,759
Besides what she said,

46
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,360
I can also protect your safety

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,719
during any fight in Mingyue Palace.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Then it's you.

49
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,879
Now that it has come to this,

50
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,879
I can only congratulate
Young Master Xiaoye.

51
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,319
Congratulations on bringing your rival

52
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,680
into the Mingyue Palace.

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
What do you mean by that?

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
I've heard

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,039
that Ji Mingyue used to
have a sweetheart.

56
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,240
This man has an exceptionally

57
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,159
handsome face.

58
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,199
How do you know?

59
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,520
Bringing such a handsome guy
full of disguise and deception

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,159
by your side,

61
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,639
aren't you worried at all?

62
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,360
How dare you deceive me!

63
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,159
Divine Physician Shen,

64
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,919
I will take you in.

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,759
Let's go right away.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,039
Okay.

67
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
You clearly remember everything.

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,520
Why pretend not to recognize me?

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,719
Your delusion seems quite serious.

70
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,719
I beg to be excused.

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,800
It seems you'll have to
stay with me a bit longer.

72
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
We suspect

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,919
there's someone from the Cult here.

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,439
Before we capture this person,

75
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,520
no one is allowed to leave.

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,159
Yes sir.

77
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,240
What is this?

78
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,360
What's inside it?

79
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,039
Take a look.

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,599
You can go.

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,159
The one behind.

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,479
Go. Go.

83
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,439
Open this.

84
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,680
Sorry, Zhili.

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,519
Only by preventing you
from entering the Mingyue Palace,

86
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,160
will that person show up.

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,439
I will pass on the order right away.

88
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,680
Make the questioning even slower.

89
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,199
Be more careful.

90
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,360
What do we do now?

91
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
If we miss the full moon,

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,680
we can't enter the Palace.

93
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,839
The Cult disciple is just a smokescreen.

94
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,199
If we want to leave as soon as possible,

95
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,120
he is the key.

96
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,680
Two more bowls of noodles
for that table.

97
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,360
Got it.

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,279
Looking for me?

99
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,000
I...

100
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,888
I...

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,079
I come to apologize.

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,959
Enjoy.

103
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,959
This is on me.

104
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,519
Let's talk while we eat.

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Actually

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
I made this wine

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,279
specially for you.

108
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,720
(It's Breath-Blocking Powder again.)

109
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,120
(Isn't it all for me?)

110
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,600
(Then accept my kindness.)

111
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,480
I reflected for a moment.

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,720
In the Huichun Valley,

113
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
it was indeed my fault.

114
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,399
Young master,

115
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,720
there's something wrong with
Physician Shen.

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,360
Did she notice something?

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,160
After all, she drugged you before.

118
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
(During the Martial Arts Convention,)

119
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,519
(the problem already arose.)

120
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,720
(What exactly happened?)

121
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,759
In the Huichun Valley,

122
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,600
we all play by the book.

123
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
But you came aggressively.

124
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Who wouldn't be on guard?

125
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,720
But ultimately,

126
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,839
it was all my fault.

127
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,720
Could you please be generous,

128
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,560
and don't bother with me?

129
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,720
Let me go.

130
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,240
Zhili,

131
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,319
as long as you promise me

132
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,399
not to enter the Mingyue Palace tonight.

133
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,040
If that's the case,

134
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,279
just forget that I came for you.

135
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,160
Zhili.

136
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,560
He's been poisoned down.

137
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,519
But there are many others outside.

138
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,360
Can we escape?

139
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,959
Others are all checking there.

140
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,240
We only need to deal with

141
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
these two in front of us.

142
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,104
In a moment,

143
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,279
we find a way to draw them away.

144
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,839
Understood.

145
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,959
Hi there, I have something to tell you.

146
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,519
What is that?

147
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
How come they fall on their own?

148
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,240
(It's that mysterious person.)

149
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,079
(He is nearby.)

150
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,280
What's going on? Go check it.

151
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,920
Yes sir.

152
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,160
Someone's coming. Let's go.

153
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,800
Go.

154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,519
Young master, you've taken the antidote.

155
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,000
Stop pretending.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Get up.

157
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,759
How is it?

158
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,879
As you expected,

159
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,439
he injured two guards,

160
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,759
and helped Physician Shen escape.

161
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,720
The forest is the necessary path
to the Mingyue Palace.

162
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,519
Inform the Twelfth Night
lurking in the forest.

163
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,560
It's time to close the net.

164
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Yes sir.

165
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,240
Stop.

166
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Stop running.

167
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,959
Stop.

168
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,759
Stop.

169
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
Stop running.

170
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,072
That's not right.

171
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,440
It's a ploy to distract us away.

172
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,360
Qing Xing, you go after them.

173
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,519
Okay. Let's go.

174
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,159
Yes sir.

175
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,159
We've really been tricked.

176
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,039
Young master, he has confessed.

177
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,200
Someone gave him a hundred taels

178
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,519
to distract us away.

179
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,279
And,

180
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,159
Physician Shen and Master Xiaoye
have already crossed the river.

181
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,960
It seems

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
that he's followed them into the palace.

183
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Now that he's in,

184
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,519
don't ever think about coming out.

185
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,320
Tell everyone to get ready.

186
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,919
Circle the Mingyue Palace.

187
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm entering the palace immediately

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,240
to capture him.

189
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,879
Yes sir.

190
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,840
To enter the Mingyue Palace,

191
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,799
one must be Ji Mingyue's new favorite.

192
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,679
Young master, bear with it for now.

193
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,000
Congratulations on
becoming the master's new favorite.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,039
We'll all count on you.

195
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,720
Exactly.

196
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,919
Congratulations, young master.

197
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,879
Your care will be much appreciated.

198
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,600
Yes, indeed.

199
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,480
Congratulations, young master.

200
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,360
Don't talk nonsense.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,240
Am I not the new favorite?

202
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,264
(Zhili,)

203
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,320
(I'll capture him immediately.)

204
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
(Let the truth come to light.)

205
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,679
(For the problem between you and me,)

206
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,559
(I will also find the answer.)

207
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,919
Darn it.

208
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,240
Darn Su Chenche.

209
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,600
I shouldn't have been lenient then.

210
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,440
Young Master Su is here.

211
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,399
You do not serve in the main hall.

212
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,679
What are you doing here at my place?

213
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,600
Watching jokes?

214
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,519
I'm here to help you regain favor.

215
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
(If Su Chenche wants to
approach Ji Mingyue,)

216
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,559
(it would be fairly easy.)

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
(If this continues,)

218
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
(how can I take the opportunity
of Xiaoye's service)

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,960
(to get the jade toggle
engraved with a phoenix?)

220
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,039
Summon Young Master Xiaoye
to serve in the palace.

221
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,879
Congratulations, Young Master Xiaoye.

222
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,480
I'll go in with you tonight,

223
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,679
waiting for your orders.

224
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,879
No need.

225
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,399
From now on,

226
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,840
you just listen to Su Chenche's orders.

227
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,639
You wouldn't be so kind.

228
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,120
There must be conditions.

229
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
I knew it.

230
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
Just shoot.

231
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,919
What do you want?

232
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,679
I want Shen Zhili.

233
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,320
(Forgive me for forcing you like this.)

234
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,679
(Because only by doing so,)

235
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,679
(can we have the chance
to talk face-to-face.)

236
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,639
Young Master Su asked for me.

237
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,279
Is there something you want to tell me?

238
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,720
An old injury has recurred.
The pain is unbearable.

239
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,840
If you had stayed in the Huichun Valley,

240
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,360
how could the old injury recur?

241
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,000
To make such a shrewd man
as Young Master Twelfth Night

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,519
come to the Mingyue Palace
regardless of his own safety,

243
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,679
there must be

244
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,960
something here

245
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,360
that you really want, right?

246
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,519
But, here's my advice.

247
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,080
No matter what you want,

248
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,679
it's best to keep your mind at ease.

249
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,320
After all,
things don't always go as planned.

250
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,879
This is the norm of life.

251
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,759
What do I want?

252
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,279
Don't you know it?

253
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,919
I want to make clear

254
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,559
why you pretend not to remember me.

255
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,879
I want to make clear

256
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,720
what misunderstanding we have.

257
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,080
What exactly are you talking about?

258
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,879
I don't get it.

259
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,519
After we parted in the tea stand,
I was poisoned. Breath-Blocking Powder.

260
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,480
Sounds familiar?

261
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,840
What exactly do you want to say?

262
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,679
If you asked me here just to test me,

263
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,720
then I beg to be excused.

264
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,679
My wounds are still untreated,
yet Physician Shen is about to leave.

265
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,440
Then I have to go to the main hall
to seek help from Ji Mingyue.

266
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,080
Then I'm afraid

267
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,120
that Young Master Xiaoye
would have to leave obediently,

268
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,679
waiting to be summoned next time.

269
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,480
(Can't let this bad guy)

270
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
(interrupt Xiaoye's private time
with Ji Mingyue.)

271
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,799
Such a minor injury.

272
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,120
How could we bother the master?

273
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
Since I'm here,

274
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,039
I will take care of it.

275
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,679
It's just...

276
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,200
right here?

277
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,559
Why not?

278
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,320
What do you want?

279
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
Su Chenche, you know I can't swim.

280
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
What exactly do you want?

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,799
You finally admit it.

282
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,360
You did it on purpose.

283
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
Zhili,

284
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
I just want to know

285
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,320
exactly what makes you hate me so much,

286
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,240
and keep away from me.

287
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,639
Don't pretend not to remember anymore.

288
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
Pretend not to remember?

289
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,200
Isn't it your forte?

290
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,080
You should think about it.

291
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,879
Zhili,

292
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,840
about amnesia,

293
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,240
I can explain it to you.

294
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,759
You do know how to avoid the important
and dwell on the trivial.

295
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
Avoid the important
and dwell on the trivial.

296
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,600
What else is there?

297
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,320
(Whether remembered)

298
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,919
(or forgotten,)

299
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,000
(no matter how many times,)

300
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,759
(I'll make you love me all over again.)

301
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,480
Physician Shen has arrived.

302
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,120
Master, greetings.

303
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,799
I have a chronic headache.

304
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,039
It strikes every month.

305
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,080
This also disturbs my temperament.

306
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,000
The hibiscus ointment for headaches

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,360
is not delivered here
as scheduled this month.

308
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,039
Xiaoye happens to recommend you.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,799
He told me

310
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,919
that you're from Huichun Valley.

311
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,000
You must have a way

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,360
to ease my pain, right?

313
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,159
May I take your pulse, master?

314
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,279
Yes.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
(Just worrying about no chance.)

316
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,960
(This way, it's much easier.)

317
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,519
No worry, master.

318
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,679
The hibiscus ointment is addictive.

319
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,399
It's not good to use it long-term.

320
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,840
With acupuncture,

321
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,960
together with soothing incenses
to aid sleep,

322
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,639
within seven days,

323
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,759
your headache will be cured.

324
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,320
Alright.

325
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,000
Then you may begin.

326
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,200
It's done.

327
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,960
Just have a good sleep.

328
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,720
The headache will be relieved.

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,639
(This medicine will put Ji Mingyue
into deep sleep within an hour.)

330
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,960
(Then, I can look for...)

331
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,639
Master.

332
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,519
Master.

333
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,399
Master.

334
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,480
Do you like me in this outfit?

335
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,720
I don't want to be like them,

336
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,160
wearing pure white all day.

337
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,640
I want to stand out in the crowd,

338
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,559
so you can see me at a glance.

339
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,759
Shen Yan, I made you a white garment.

340
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,759
No need.

341
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,240
From now on, I'll only wear this color.

342
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,400
Why?

343
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,599
Because Ji Yue likes it.

344
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,039
Because Ji Yue likes it.

345
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,920
Master.

346
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:44,559
Master.

347
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,599
You used to like pure white only.

348
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,960
Just because of that woman,

349
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
you've changed.

350
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,279
You failed me.

351
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,480
I want you dead.

352
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,200
I want them all to be buried with you.

353
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,680
Master.

354
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:05,480
(No suspicious person
seen leaving the palace.)

355
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,720
(The men of the Twelfth Night
have been in ambush outside the palace.)

356
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,079
(Never saw that person
leave the palace.)

357
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,200
Can't wait any more.

358
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,799
We must force him to show up.
