Since then,

to eradicate the Cult

(Herbal Hut)

190
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,960
Failing to stir up trouble,

191
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,879
now you try to slander Huichun Valley.

192
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,159
What exactly do you want?

193
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,960
What do I want?

194
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,159
Shouldn't you be the clearest about it?

195
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,559
(That's not right.)

196
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,320
(His expression just now...)

197
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
(Why does it seem like
he knows nothing about the poisoning?)

198
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,519
(Then why would he admit by silence?)

199
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,000
If there's nothing else,

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,480
please leave.

201
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,279
However,

202
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,639
if you want to inquire about Su Chenche,

203
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,879
I'm willing to have a chat with you.

204
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,200
(This medicinal fragrance...)

205
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,279
(It's that mysterious person.)

206
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,120
(The scent is fading.)

207
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,799
(It seems they've already left.)

208
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,759
(Why would that person come here?)

209
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,759
(Yu Lian is arrogant and conceited.)

210
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,759
(Without a good reason,)

211
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,559
(he can't possibly take the blame
that isn't his.)

212
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,240
(Therefore,)

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,960
(he is related to the mysterious one.)

214
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,440
(If the poison was given by that one,)

215
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,919
(and Yu Lian is taking the blame,)

216
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,519
(everything makes sense.)

217
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,679
Go ahead.

218
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,879
What do you want me to do?

219
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,759
But,

220
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,960
if you truly wish to cooperate with me,

221
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,559
give me the antidote first.

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,879
Huichun Valley is a lifelong effort
of my master.

223
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,600
I will not allow it to be slandered.

224
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,960
It's simple.

225
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,759
Kill Su Chenche.

226
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,159
Then I'll give you the antidote.

227
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,519
Otherwise, Huichun Valley

228
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,480
will bear that stigma forever.

229
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,919
Why are you laughing?

230
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,759
I've overestimated you.

231
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,559
What do you mean?

232
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,039
If you really have something to do
with this poison,

233
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,519
you should know

234
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,360
I have cured Su Chenche of this poison.

235
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,320
Clearly, it wasn't you.

236
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,519
Yet you insist on admitting it.

237
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,840
Are you Cult people

238
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,360
so eager to help?

239
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,720
You really have a sharp tongue.

240
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,679
You're exasperated, aren't you?

241
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,879
It seems I've hit the nail on the head.

242
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,159
The person who gave the poison

243
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,919
probably hasn't gone far, right?

244
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,360
If I go now,

245
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,759
I can finally see their true face.

246
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,639
One,

247
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,720
two,

248
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,440
three!

249
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,360
In that case,

250
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,159
you will have to cooperate with me.

251
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,919
Young Master,

252
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,960
Physician Shen went to Herbal Hut again.

253
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,440
There's no need to worry.

254
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,320
She won't affect our plan.

255
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,360
If the Cult tries to make use of her,

256
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,919
will the situation become chaotic?

257
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,759
Chaotic? Yes.

258
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,559
Only then will there be an opportunity.

259
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,519
I am sure

260
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,080
that we can catch him this time.

261
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,879
Right.

262
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,080
As long as he's dead,

263
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,519
you'll be one step closer

264
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,759
to your goal.

265
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,519
Dear.

266
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,679
Your injury has almost healed,

267
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,919
but you can't let your guard down.

268
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,440
The finals are imminent.

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,799
I've stewed some soup for you

270
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,159
to nourish your body.

271
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
You've been tired all day.

272
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,960
No need to work so hard.

273
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,519
Making soup for you

274
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,080
can hardly be called hard work.

275
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,159
You

276
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,960
seem a bit different today.

277
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,799
What's different?

278
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,159
You're playing with fire.

279
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,919
(Kill him.)

280
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,879
(Kill him.)

281
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,799
(Kill him.)

282
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,639
(Kill him!)

283
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,480
(Su Chenche.)

284
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,919
Go die.

285
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,519
Dear,

286
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,640
