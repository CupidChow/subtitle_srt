=Episode 8=

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,320
Zhili.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,399
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,399
Stay away from my wife.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,600
His pulse is weak and erratic.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,560
I need a medicinal jar.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,760
His body isn't in serious condition.

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,359
But why is the pulse
still weak and erratic?

18
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,359
Thank you, Zhili.

19
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,719
Senior,

20
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,799
you have not yet recovered.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,719
Take the medicine.

22
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,959
Zhili, do you want to poison me

23
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,599
just after treating me?

24
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,519
Why would I?

25
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,599
I wouldn't possibly harm you.

26
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,560
The Seven Souls Decoction
is beneficial to the body.

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,680
You're getting better.

28
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,400
What do you mean by that?

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,719
Senior!

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,719
You smell so good.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,680
I haven't taken a bath for three months.

32
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,560
Then let's take one now.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Senior!

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,360
Put me down!

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,520
Hua Jiuye!

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,039
Dear.

37
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,719
I shouldn't have left you
alone with him.

38
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,520
Hua Jiuye.

39
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,960
How dare you touch my wife?

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,759
You're asking for this.

41
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,479
Stop fighting.

42
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,879
You really don't need my treatment?

43
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,800
Do I look like someone

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,479
who needs to be treated?

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,080
You look like being about to die.

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,919
Dear.

47
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,199
See how formidable I am?

48
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,719
Even if there were ten of Hua Jiuye,

49
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,759
I could kill them with ease.

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
I told you

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
not to move this arm.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,152
Do you want to keep this arm or not?

53
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,919
Let's see if you can
keep yourself alive.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Su Chenche.

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,719
He is my senior brother.

56
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,400
Fine.

57
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,080
Since you're my wife's senior brother,

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,479
you're also mine.

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,719
But I can't tolerate the fact

60
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,759
that he bullies you.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,159
You want to die?

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,199
I have work to do.

63
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,520
You two stay put.

64
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,680
Zhili.

65
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
You're too green

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
to fight against me.

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,479
Still haven't found a trace.

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
Let's go have some tea.

69
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,919
(They are staying here as well.)

70
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,400
Waiter, bring the tea.

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
Right away.

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,800
When we find the Physician Shen Zhili,

73
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
just capture her first.

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,039
(They want me?)

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
(Does the holder of
Gold Osmanthus Toad know me?)

76
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,879
Stop.

77
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,199
Here you are.

78
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,560
Why are you...

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,399
Act along.

80
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,319
It took me some time to find you.

81
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,079
Hua.

82
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,079
Trying to run away
after you're sold to us?

83
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,480
Come back with me.

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
(Tianfu Banking House)
Move.

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,800
I'll break your legs after we return.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,160
Let me go.

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Don't do this.

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,680
Hurry up.

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Let me go.

90
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,199
Why are you here?

91
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,160
Where is my senior?

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,959
Young master.

93
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,360
Where should we take him?

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
To the ends of the world.

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,519
As far as possible.

96
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,319
Go.

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,399
He had something to attend to and left.

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,399
He left?

99
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,240
That's good.

100
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,839
Then he won't make trouble for me.

101
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,519
You own that inn, right?

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
It does belong to our Twelfth Night.

103
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,399
If you like it,

104
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,279
I can buy you

105
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,720
the whole street as a gift.

106
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:42,176
(Breeze Inn)

107
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:50,120
(The Yuanjiang leader)

108
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,040
Waiter, serve the dishes.

109
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,879
Coming.

110
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,000
What would you like to order?

111
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Who are you?

112
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,000
You must be joking with me.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,759
Of course,

114
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,040
I am the proprietor of this Breeze Inn.

115
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,000
Such elegance in a proprietor.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,839
Why haven't I seen you before?

117
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
Let me tell you.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
Along this street,

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,879
there are many of our properties.

120
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,319
I went to collect the rent

121
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,639
for the last few days.

122
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,319
We couldn't find her.

123
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,199
This is a portrait

124
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,560
of the person who stole
the Gold Osmanthus Toad.

125
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
If anyone saw it

126
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,000
and let the thief escape,

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
could you handle the consequences?

128
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,959
Are you looking for someone?

129
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,040
Why didn't you say so earlier?

130
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,600
Master.

131
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
What is it, dear?

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,680
Master.

133
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
They are looking for someone.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh?

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,399
Then you've come to the right place.

136
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,000
In this area,

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
all the lost sows,

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,120
runaway lovers,

139
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,560
and long-lost mothers

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,759
are found by me.

141
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,399
Sir, within three days,

142
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,120
I will bring news to you.

143
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Alright.

144
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,959
I would like you to get me

145
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,879
the registers of all the inns

146
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,360
within ten li around here

147
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,519
in the last three days.

148
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,160
Does this person have any features?

149
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,720
That'll make my search easier.

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
Ordinary appearance.

151
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,759
No distinguishing traits.

152
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,959
Just get me the registers.

153
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,839
Alright then.

154
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,639
I'll go collect the registers.

155
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,839
Sir.

156
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,000
Your tea is here.

157
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:52,800
(No. 3)

158
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,360
(The person depicted on the scroll)

159
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,000
(must be the owner of
the Gold Osmanthus Toad.)

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
(I wonder if the Grand Elder)

161
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
(could possibly keep the portrait here.)

162
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,199
(I must find and confirm it.)

163
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,959
(And also get ahead of them.)

164
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,120
Dear.

165
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
Why are you here?

166
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,799
Look around over here.

167
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,960
Over here.

168
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,159
Stop right there.

169
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,720
Sir.

170
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,519
What can I do for you?

171
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,799
You two have been here all along.

172
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,799
I wonder if you've seen

173
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,799
anyone suspicious?

174
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,000
Sir.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,879
Do you think

176
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,639
we paid any attention to anything else?

177
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,559
Sorry to disturb you.

178
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,720
Dear, let's go.

179
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,879
Go check it out.

180
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,639
Yes.

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,200
It was all just expedient measures.

182
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
Don't take it seriously.

183
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,879
Dear.

184
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,279
Your...

185
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,600
is quite nice.

186
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm going to bed.

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,159
You go back now.

188
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,840
Hey.

189
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,559
We are husband and wife.

190
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,960
Not really...

191
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,279
You seemed so passionate just now,

192
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,559
but now you sleep in separate rooms?

193
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,120
Dear.

194
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,919
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,879
Don't kick me out.

196
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,039
Are you really sorry?

197
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,960
Then tell me,

198
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
what exactly did you do wrong?

199
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,519
I shouldn't have helped
Cui from next door

200
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,279
look for that hen.

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,559
Cui?

202
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,600
You helped her?

203
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,039
Now I must give you a lesson.

204
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,159
Dear.

205
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,120
There are so many guests around.

206
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,799
I want to save face.

207
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,720
You cheated on me

208
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,279
and ask me to save your face?

209
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,120
I don't want to live with you anymore.

210
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,519
I'm going back to my parents.

211
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,200
Fine.

212
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,720
As long as you stay with me,

213
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,000
you can hit me however you want.

214
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,919
I'll hit you for real.

215
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,559
Do it.

216
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,480
Are you okay?

217
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,279
No.

218
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,759
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,960
I'll go get medicine.

220
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,480
Dear.

221
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,840
Were you showing concern for me?

222
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
This is not the time

223
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,159
for kidding.

224
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
He hasn't left yet.

225
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,879
I think

226
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,240
he'll only leave

227
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,200
after we turn off the lights.

228
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,799
Dear.

229
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,240
It's late now.

230
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,480
Let's go to bed.

231
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,600
Otherwise

232
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,279
we might disturb the guests.

233
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,159
I want to be on top.

234
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,399
Whether a real couple or a fake one,

235
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,960
this test will tell.

236
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
(Oh no.)

237
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,759
Dear.

238
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,519
Let's be a real couple.

239
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,704
(Guangju Hall)

240
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
Speaking of a lovers' night

241
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
and frolicking ducks,

242
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,639
I will talk about

243
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,320
the story in yesterday's bridal chamber.

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Su Chenche.

245
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,600
What's wrong with you?

246
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,919
A bridal chamber where fondness lingers.

247
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,240
The night is short,

248
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,840
yet you wish to spend every night

249
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,919
enjoying the pleasing scenery.

250
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,679
(This libertine usually
seems shameless,)

251
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,279
(but turns out to be a gentleman.)

252
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,559
Are you interested
in martial arts stories?

253
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,399
If so, I'll tell you some.

254
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,720
(I can bring him some.)

255
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,600
Come take a look.

256
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,759
When it comes to the figures
of the martial world,

257
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,200
one must mention the Su family.

258
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,960
The love story between Su Shenyan

259
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,799
and the cult's holy maiden Shen Jiyue

260
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,120
is surely tragic.

261
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,720
Today,

262
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,039
I'll talk about
the descendant of Su Shenyan.

263
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,120
Mister.

264
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,639
I'd like some...

265
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,360
Mister.

266
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,240
I want mung bean cake.

267
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,799
Right away.

268
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,919
The descendant of Su Shenyan,

269
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,879
the gentleman in white, Su Chenche,

270
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,360
also had a romance with the lady in red,
Ye Qianqian.

271
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,480
This story

272
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,519
has caused quite a stir.

273
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,799
Ye Qianqian?

274
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,759
To be precise,

275
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,639
the soon-to-be bride of Su Chenche.

276
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,519
(Soon-to-be)

277
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,720
(bride?)

278
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
Su Chenche and I were supposed to marry.

279
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
But unfortunately, he was injured

280
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,679
and needed treatment at Huichun Valley.

281
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,679
There, he was kidnapped.

282
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,919
Just when Ye Qianqian and Su Chenche

283
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,039
were about to complete their marriage,

284
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,799
someone suddenly stepped in

285
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,519
and forcefully took away

286
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,600
Young Master Su of Twelfth Night.

287
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,759
This woman is so despicable.

288
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,360
Exactly, she is detestable.

289
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,080
Su Chenche is just my patient.

290
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,919
Of course, I believe you.

291
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,000
You have an illustrious reputation

292
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,480
as the Lord of Huichun Valley.

293
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,639
You wouldn't degrade
yourself to an affair.

294
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,000
It's okay. He's gone.

295
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,960
You've been poisoned?

296
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,399
I'm fine.

297
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,960
You don't have to endure it.

298
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,120
I can help you.
