=Episode 12=

11
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,600
Come in.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,200
That was way too fast, young master.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,479
Should I get you some tonics?

14
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,680
Look who's getting funny.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,120
Be serious.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
Young master,

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,640
we haven't found
the person who attacked you.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,439
Look into all the pharmacies.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,840
Right.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
Pass on my word.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,439
Close the city gate
in the name of Twelfth Night.

22
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,120
Find that person

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,280
even if you have to dig into the ground.

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Understood.

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,879
My lord.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
Close the gate.

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
Tell our people to check everyone

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
who enters or leaves for wounds.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,159
Don't let anyone get away.

30
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,799
Understood.

31
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,319
Close the gate.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,359
Stop.

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,359
Don't you know who I am?

34
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,240
Of course, I do.

35
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,840
But I can't let you pass.

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,319
Senior,

37
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,439
are you leaving without saying goodbye?

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
Physician Shen.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,159
Are you leaving?

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
Just a second.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
Open up.

42
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,960
You know I don't like to say goodbye.

43
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,919
Why did you come?

44
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,680
I just came out to buy herbs

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,479
and passed by here.

46
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,960
Huajian Stone.

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,159
Liuli Pill.

48
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,120
Guchui Grass.

49
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,080
Since when do you use

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,879
the herbal ingredients I use?

51
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,240
Really?

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,240
In that case,

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,919
you can keep these.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,599
Senior,

55
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,759
I wonder

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,479
when we'll meet again.

57
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,960
Come on.

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,080
This is too cheesy for both of us.

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,800
See you.

60
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,919
Zhili.

61
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,639
From now on,

62
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,479
you're only my junior.

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,719
Physician Shen?

64
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,120
How come you're back again?

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,560
I have a few things for Hua Jiuye.

66
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,120
Go ahead.

67
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,360
Young master,

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,480
we haven't found anyone suspicious.

69
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,560
Right.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,199
Our people reported that

71
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,079
Physician Shen
went to see Hua Jiuye off.

72
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,120
But strangely,

73
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,279
she went twice

74
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,399
and hasn't come back.

75
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,240
Physician Shen?

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,319
We'll go after him.

77
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,120
That is to say,

78
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
this person disguised as me and left.

79
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,279
He knows how to disguise.

80
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,160
He may be a master of disguise,

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,040
but it's still not easy

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,439
to disguise as you

83
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,160
and go unnoticed by the guards

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
who have just seen you.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,480
The arrow he shot at you was poisonous.

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,000
It contains Huichun Grass

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,439
peculiar to the Huichun Valley.

88
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,639
Dear.

89
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,639
Don't you think

90
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,759
this person is very close to you?

91
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,000
Close to me?

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,759
There's a mole in Huichun Valley.

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Who can it be?

94
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,199
Everyone is a suspect

95
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,360
except for my master.

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,879
Rest assured.

97
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,399
I will get to the bottom of it.

98
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,879
Young master.

99
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,519
We lost him.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
Then let's head to

101
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,160
the Wumo Villa

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,399
for the Martial Arts Convention.

103
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,319
Martial Arts Convention?

104
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,360
I heard that
all major sects were invited.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,439
Someone offered the Ice Jade Bowl.

106
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,240
The winner of
the Martial Arts Convention

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,040
will lead everyone to attack the Cult.

108
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,759
Is that true?

109
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,759
(With the Ice Jade Bowl,)

110
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,639
(I'll have all three core ingredients.)

111
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,480
I want to go.

112
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,800
But we've turned down the invitation.

113
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,000
But...

114
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,160
We'll join them.

115
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,759
Tell them that

116
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,920
we'll participate.

117
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
Young master,

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,639
invitations are required to attend

119
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,839
the Martial Arts Convention.

120
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,279
But all the invitations were sent.

121
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,199
There's no extra.

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
Right.

123
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,680
Huichun Valley also forbids us

124
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,399
from taking part in those affairs.

125
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,800
I bet all the sects know that.

126
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,360
Don't worry, dear.

127
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,480
I have an idea.

128
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:01,952
(Invitation)

129
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,639
(We invite Lu Qinqin to this event.)
My sister-in-law is a swordswoman.

130
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
My brother just passed away.

131
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,879
She couldn't go around.

132
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,279
You'll disguise as her.

133
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,319
It's the best solution.

134
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,800
But you must remember.

135
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,519
She's my sister-in-law.

136
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,639
Brother-in-law, please show respect.

137
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,360
We are in-laws, after all.

138
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,600
We should keep our distance.

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,839
Sister-in-law,

140
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,519
how much distance should we keep?

141
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,519
Okay, that's about right.

142
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,639
Whatever you say,

143
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,720
sister-in-law.

144
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,160
As long as it makes you happy,

145
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,519
sister-in-law.

146
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,279
Right?

147
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,839
Alright, come here.

148
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,279
Yes, dear.

149
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,680
You're my brother-in-law.

150
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,079
But you

151
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
are my soon-to-be bride.

152
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,160
(Wumo City)

153
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:22,208
(Yongsheng Winehouse)

154
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,519
Sister-in-law.

155
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,039
After you.

156
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,320
Brother-in-law.

157
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
After you.

158
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:44,352
(Wumo Villa)

159
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,519
Dressing like a swordswoman
is not enough.

160
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,200
I must look like a princess.

161
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,960
Do you think Lu Qinqin

162
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,200
would like accessories in this color?

163
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,120
How would I know

164
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,399
what other women like?

165
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,159
Why are you hiding in the dark?

166
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,320
Isn't it just like
our relationship right now?

167
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,200
It's in the dark.

168
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,120
It may be true,

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,960
but you're injured.

170
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,559
Lie down there.

171
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,600
It's okay.

172
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Take your time.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,080
I will wait here.

174
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,679
Is this okay?

175
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,480
Yeah.

176
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
You always look good.

177
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,000
Stop it.

178
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,519
Qing Xing just told me some things

179
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,039
about Lu Qinqin.

180
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,960
I got this.

181
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,000
Brother-in-law.

182
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,440
Sister-in-law, don't forget

183
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,000
the rules we've set.

184
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,799
Rest assured, young master.

185
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,519
I'll take care of our lady.

186
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,159
Young Master Su
from the Twelfth Night is here.

187
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:41,664
(Loyalty and Righteousness)

188
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,080
Greetings, Young Master Su.

189
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
Spare the formalities.

190
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,440
Mr. Zhang.

191
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Let's drink.

192
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,559
Cheers.

193
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,039
Come on.

194
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,919
Cheers.

195
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,639
Toast to you.

196
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,440
Everybody, let's all

197
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,320
toast to Young Master Su.

198
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,919
Come on.

199
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,840
- Come on.
- Come on.

200
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,799
To Young Master Su.

201
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,120
Come on.

202
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,279
Cheers.

203
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,120
Alright!

204
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,039
My lady.

205
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,600
It's an honor for my young master.

206
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,159
Indeed the Twelfth Night Young Master.

207
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,639
Young Master Su, toast to you.

208
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,399
You're wrong.

209
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,559
Seven years ago,
he pacified the Nangui riot.

210
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,360
Five years ago, he took out
the bandits in the mountain.

211
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,159
Three years ago,
he fought the Xinu in Chidi.

212
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,799
Those were all under his command.

213
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,120
He didn't get to this position

214
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,519
thanks to the Twelfth Night.

215
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,000
He's come so far

216
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,480
all thanks to himself.

217
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,000
Miss Lu, why aren't you eating?

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,919
Don't you like the dishes?

219
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,279
I just came a long way

220
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,440
from Jiaozhou.

221
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,960
It's a bit tiring.

222
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,360
My seniors are quite acquainted
with your family.

223
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,720
How are your parents?

224
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,440
My father was injured a few years back

225
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,960
and he's recovering.

226
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,159
My mother just went for fun
with the second and third ladies.

227
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,240
They just arrived in Xiangxi.

228
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,000
Miss Lu, I've heard so much
about your sword moves.

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
But I don't see

230
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,360
any callus on your hand
from the practice.

231
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,639
How did you remove them?

232
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,399
(Oh no.)

233
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,519
- I...
- My sister-in-law has been busy

234
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,600
with the palace affairs for five years

235
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,399
and hasn't practiced.

236
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,679
Isn't it expected?

237
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,440
Well...

238
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,960
You're right, Young Master Su.

239
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,720
Why did you come?

240
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,000
You've looked at me a dozen times

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
in such a short while.

242
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,840
Do you miss me so much?

243
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,159
If you didn't look at me,

244
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,840
how did you know I was looking at you?

245
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,639
Could it be

246
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,399
that you also miss me?

247
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
Of course.

248
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,440
Sister-in-law, don't forget.

249
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,639
Rule No.1.

250
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,159
Don't leave each other's sight.

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
Look.

252
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,960
I didn't expect Young Master Su
to be so nice to his sister-in-law.

253
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,919
So considerate.

254
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Someone is coming.

255
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,039
Young Master Su.

256
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,720
Thank you for saving us.

257
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
We toast to you.

258
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,440
Toast to you.

259
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,559
You've drunk so much, brother-in-law.

260
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,600
Don't get sick.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,639
I noticed that you liked this...

262
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
It's started.

263
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,759
Let's go.

264
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,000
The Cult is undisciplined
and out of control,

265
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,840
endangering the people

266
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,039
to a great extent.

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Our lord invited you all

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,039
to the Wumo Villa

269
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,120
for a seven-day martial arts convention
under Young Master Su's

270
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,879
supervision and witness.

271
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,399
The winner will claim the precious

272
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,039
Ice Jade Bowl.

273
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,159
Ice Jade Bowl?

274
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,039
That's the Ice Jade Bowl?

275
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,440
It's said that having medicine

276
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,000
from this bowl helps with healing

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,080
and improves one's cultivation.

278
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,840
So it makes sense
for the Wumo Villa to hold

279
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,519
the Martial Arts Convention

280
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,080
to put a top martial artist

281
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,759
in charge of this bowl.

282
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,039
The Ice Jade Bowl will be
kept in the Treasure Pavilion

283
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,600
and guarded by a martial artist.

284
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,000
I hope all of us will follow the lead

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,879
of the future alliance leader.

286
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,639
We should be united

287
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,639
to eradicate the evil.

288
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,399
Be united!

289
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,000
Eradicate the evil!

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,399
Be united!

291
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,639
Eradicate the evil!

292
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,840
Be united!

293
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,639
Eradicate the evil!

294
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,039
It's your honor to be made

295
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,559
the witness to this convention.

296
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,600
Won't you go in?

297
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,200
No.

298
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,000
What a pity.

299
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,799
I can't take part in the convention

300
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,919
as the host.

301
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
So I can't

302
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,240
get the Ice Jade Bowl for you.

303
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,519
But you're injured.

304
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,000
You can't take part in it, anyway.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,840
Don't worry.

306
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,919
I have an idea.

307
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,240
Don't forget Rule No.2.

308
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,399
No physical intimacy.

309
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,759
Let's just hold hands then.

310
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,288
(Du Xiaoxiao)

311
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,080
A mosquito.

312
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,360
On your face, brother-in-law.

313
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,039
Young Master Su.

314
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,279
I'll leave you to talk.

315
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,000
Young Master Su.

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm Du Xiaoxiao from the Hengshan Sect.

317
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,120
I noticed that you were drunk,

318
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,200
so I made some hang-over soup.

319
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,360
No, thanks.

320
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,559
What is it?

321
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,120
May I ask about
your relationship with Ye Qianqian?

322
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,919
We're almost strangers.

323
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,759
Great.

324
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,559
I've been admiring you for a long time.

325
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,039
Can you give me a chance?

326
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,600
No way. Not at all.

327
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,360
Excuse me.

328
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Have you heard?

329
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,720
The Wumo Villa is holding
the Martial Arts Convention.

330
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,200
Hengshan Sect,

331
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,919
E'lian Sect,

332
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,879
Gudong Sect,

333
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,600
Songlin Sect,

334
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,960
and Yuyang Sect were invited

335
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,639
to eradicate the Cult.

336
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,360
Almost

337
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
all the sects are invited.

338
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,919
I've also heard that

339
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,720
the Cult is making a move.

340
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
People speculate

341
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,480
that the Cult
is trying to kill everyone.

342
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,039
It's getting heated.

343
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,440
I heard that the convention is hosted by

344
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,799
the Twelfth Night Young Master.

345
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,240
He brought a woman wearing a veil,

346
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,759
called Lu Qinqin.

347
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,839
Who knows who she is?

348
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,720
Everyone knows that
Young Master Su has been

349
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
in contact with the Cult woman.

350
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,200
I bet the veil is a disguise.

351
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,160
Good point.

352
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,160
Tell me.

353
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
How do I get to the Wumo Villa?

354
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,039
Young master.

355
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,400
We found a faceless corpse

356
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,839
on the back hill here.

357
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,599
It seems

358
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,680
that he has found his way in.
