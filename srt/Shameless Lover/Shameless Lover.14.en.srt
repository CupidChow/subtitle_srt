That lantern is prepared for you.

119
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,720
Watch this.

120
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,279
Why did my lantern fly away?

121
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,399
I simply wish for them
to always be together.

122
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
I think

123
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,199
that the most correct thing
I've done recently

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,399
is to make our relationship public.

125
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,399
Otherwise,

126
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,959
we would have to restrain ourselves

127
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,079

128
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,040

129
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
it was really tough.

130
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,720
We must keep a distance.

131
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,560
It seems

132
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,439
lies really can't be told carelessly.

133
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,240
Yes.

134
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,319

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,839
Of course.

138
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480

139
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,759

140
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,120

150
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,079
Yes.

151
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,959
Is there any more wound medicine?

152
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,160
I heard Hua Jiuye is after you.

153
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,519

154
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,680

155
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,040
Right Guardian, no need to worry.

156
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,959
You should mind your own business.

157
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,439
If you fail again...

158
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,800
You will try every means

159
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,480

178
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,679
I've been waiting for a long time.

179
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,039
Please.

180
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,840
Don't you drink tea?

181
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,320
The tea from the Right Guardian
of the Cult,

182
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
how dare I drink it?

183
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,440
It seems you have learned about me.

184
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,360
It's just that I wonder
if you know your own affairs

185
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,240
as clearly as you know mine?

186
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,519
What are you trying to say now?

187
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
Su Chenche is feigning amnesia?

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,080
Or he has ulterior motives
for approaching me?

189
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,639
You seem to trust him.

190
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,919
Of course.

191
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,480
Should I trust you,
the Right Guardian of the Cult?

192
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,519
I'm leaving.

193
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
Isn't it because you suspect him

194
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,879
that you came to me?

195
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,960
He repeatedly claims

196
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
to eliminate the Cult

197
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,240
and uphold justice.

198
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,840
Could he really be so righteous?

199
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,320
What exactly are you trying to say?

200
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,639
Back then,

201
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,720
Shen Jiyue betrayed our hierarch

202
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,240
and eloped with Su Shenyan.

203
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,720
And not long after that,
Su Chenche was born.

204
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,360
The enmity
of stealing one's wife must die.

205
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,480
Hierarch Yuyan searched for four years,

206
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,080
finally found their hiding place.

207
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,600
Chenche,

208
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,240
do you like the new clothes?

209
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
I like them.

210
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,879
The last dish is here.

211
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,679
Chenche,

212
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,639
Do you see it?

213
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,120
(Shen Jiyue, Su Chenche's mother)
Your father is beloved for his cooking.

214
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
That's why I married him.

215
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,919
Come on.

216
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,679
Be careful.

217
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,480
Jiyue!

218
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,879
Mother!

219
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,799
Father!

220
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,600
Father!

221
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,279
Mother!

222
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,600
Mother!

223
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,279
Mother!

224
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,200
Father!

225
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,720
The provoked Su Shenyan

226
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,480
then founded the Twelfth Night.

227
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,120
The Twelfth Night,

228
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
aside from overthrowing us,

229
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,039
also had an unknown purpose,

230
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,840
that is to find a way
to revive Shen Jiyue.

231
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,480
Although Su Shenyan has already died,

232
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,519
Su Chenche is committed
to his father's will.

233
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,440
The steps to revive his mother
have never ceased.

234
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,399
Your Huichun Valley's

235
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,799
former master

236
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,039
passed away unexpectedly not long ago.

237
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,360
And Shen Zhili, the current master
who has never left the valley

238
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,120
bravely got into the Mingyue Palace

239
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,679
and battled Yuanjiang King.

240
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
And now,

241
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,360
you concealed your identity for
the Martial Arts Convention.

242
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,279
You Huichun Valley

243
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,559
never involved
in the martial world's strife.

244
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,159
I guess your goal

245
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,840
must be the Ice Jade Bowl, right?

246
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,399
We're both healers.

247
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,399
I also know of a method

248
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,080
that can resurrect people.

249
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,039
The Twelfth Night Splendor.

250
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,679
Su Chenche isn't unaware of it, is he?

251
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,840
Lady Shen, you are smart.

252
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,600
It shouldn't be hard to guess

253
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,120
his purpose in getting close to you.

254
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,919
He wants the three core ingredients

255
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,320
to revive his mother.

256
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,000
Can you still trust him?

257
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,519
Was the expression I just had

258
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,879
what you wanted to see?

259
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,279
Your means to incite

260
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,440
are really much worse
than to poison-making.

261
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,639
It would be wise to use them less.

262
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,480
Then it seems

263
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,919
I've made you come here for nothing.

264
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,200
Not necessarily.

265
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,919
The reason I came to the appointment

266
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,840
is just to confirm one thing.

267
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,240
The poison you used to hurt Su Chenche

268
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,000
contained an ingredient
from Huichun Valley,

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,799
that is impossible for outsiders
to obtain,

270
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,600
unless

271
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
Huichun Valley has a mole from the Cult.

272
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,600
Whether there is a mole or not,

273
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,039
you should find out yourself,

274
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,200
and you would know.

275
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,879
It's not that no outsiders
have ever entered Huichun Valley.

276
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,799
Su Chenche had stayed there for days.

277
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,440
Could the poison have been given by him?

278
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,919
If you plan to start with me

279
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,559
to bring down Su Chenche,

280
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,039
you will be disappointed.

281
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,879
Qing Xing.

282
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,759
Physician Shen,

283
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,679
where have you been?

284
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,720
Our young master
has been looking for you.

285
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,159
I was busy just now.

286
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,279
I will go to him now.

287
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,440
(The shape of this sword...)

288
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,879
(Why does it match his wound back then?)

289
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,720
(They're the same.)

290
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,679
(If I tell you Su Chenche
is faking amnesia,)

291
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,799
(would you still send me away?)

292
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,799
(His purpose for getting close to you)

293
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,639
(is to get the three core ingredients)

294
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,639
(to revive his mother.)

295
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,399
Physician Shen,

296
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,200
what's wrong?

297
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,039
(Could it be a coincidence?)

298
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,200
It's nothing.

299
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,440
I just feel

300
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,039
the shape of your sword
is somewhat unique.

301
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,559
This sword has been passed down
in my family.

302
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,240
There's only this one in the world.

303
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,320
Ever since I began training
in martial arts,

304
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,519
it has always been with me.

305
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:28,879
I see.

306
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,039
I heard Su Chenche say

307
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,759
you often spar to compare skills.

308
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,519
One time,

309
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,039
you accidentally stabbed him.

310
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,159
Is that so?

311
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,559
How is that possible?

312
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,240
Unless it was him letting me,

313
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,039
otherwise I...

314
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,440
Physician Shen,

315
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
I haven't yet completed my task.

316
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,480
I shall take my leave.

317
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,320
(True or false,)

318
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,039
(one test will tell.)

319
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,639
You're recovering nicely.

320
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,600
Keep it up.

321
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,840
You have put in much effort.

322
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,440
Indeed, it has been quite worrying.

323
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,679
I remember

324
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,840
I also treated this wound.

325
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,159
At that time, I was wondering

326
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,159
who could have seriously injured

327
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,120
the Twelfth Night Young Master.

328
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,320
Actually, it was Qing Xing.

329
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,440
The details,

330
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
I don't remember.

331
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,919
But Qing Xing told me last time

332
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,879
that I sent him to infiltrate the Cult,

333
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,279
so to gain their trust,

334
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,360
he came to assassinate me,

335
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
and I let him hurt me.

336
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,759
(He doesn't seem to be lying.)

337
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,639
(But...)

338
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,080
Oh.

339
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
What delicious food did you get me?

340
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,200
This is a pastry I made myself.

341
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:58,879
Give it a try.

342
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,279
Hazelnut cake.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Do you like it?

344
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,440
Physician Shen,

345
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,359
the hazelnut needs to be picked out.

346
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,279
Why?

347
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,359
He doesn't like it?

348
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,240
It's rubella.

349
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,400
Before we came to Huichun Valley,

350
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,720
we happened to eat hazelnuts on the way.

351
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,200
As a result, the young master
broke out in red rashes all over.

352
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,119
(Since before
you came to Huichun Valley,)

353
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,240
(you already knew
you would get rubella,)

354
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,519
(so if you hadn't lost your memory,)

355
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,359
(you would definitely resist hazelnuts.)

356
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,680
Delicious.
