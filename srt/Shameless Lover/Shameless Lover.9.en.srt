10

=Episode 9=

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,359
You don't have to endure it.

12
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,520
I can help you.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,119
(I should have held back.)

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,759
(Nothing should have happened, right?)

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,359
(It should be...)

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Are you sure?

17
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
I believe with your help,
my young master

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,640
has almost recovered, right?

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,480
I wonder when you will return him.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
He came to seek help from me on his own.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,200
What do you mean by returning him?

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,560
Also, a person with amnesia

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,799
will mostly remember

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,560
the people or things important to him.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,640
Yet, I've never heard your name.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,879
So, Lady Ye,

27
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,239
for the sake of my patient,

28
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,840
let's wait until he remembers you.

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,680
A witch versus a physician,
how will this end?

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,079
She's indeed a tough girl to deal with.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,640
Indeed,

32
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,079
sentimentality leaves nothing
but regret,

33
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,079
and deep affection cannot twist fate.

34
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,799
Apart from the treatment fee,

35
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,120
I'll also give you
some money for cooperation.

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,480
Cooperation fee?

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,120
How much?

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,959
Ten thousand taels.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,079
Holding hands,

40
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,959
ten thousand taels.

41
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,280
(It's been long.)

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,480
(I've almost forgotten)

43
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,000
(that it's all just acting.)

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,319
Dear.

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,159
Dear.

46
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,319
You're awake.

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
I've placed the medicine here.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Three times a day.

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,120
Take it for three days
and you will be healed.

50
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,439
Dear,

51
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,080
last night, we...

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Don't forget

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,039
that I am a physician.

54
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,680
I merely used silver needles

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,479
to force out the poison from your body.

56
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,479
Don't overthink it.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
So that's how it was.

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,479
Dear,

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,840
where are you going?

60
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
I'll go with you.

61
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,520
No need.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,080
I can handle it myself.

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
You should rest well.

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,360
Dear,

65
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,560
they are still suspicious of us.

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
So I...

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,199
What's fake is fake.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,159
No matter how real it looks like,

69
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,240
it's still fake.

70
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,039
No need to force it.

71
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,560
Dear,

72
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,319
are you alright?

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,439
I'm fine.

74
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,199
I was just thinking

75
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,599
along this journey,

76
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,159
due to my own selfish desires,

77
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,759
I have put you
in a lot of trouble and danger.

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
So,

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,199
you shouldn't get too involved anymore.

80
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,199
I can solve it on my own.

81
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,879
Dear,

82
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,840
what are you talking about?

83
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,879
What do you mean by that?

84
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,039
You're going to leave me behind again?

85
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,759
No.

86
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,080
Leaving and staying,

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
it's up to you.

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
Also,

89
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,399
the way you call me "Dear",

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
I do not deserve it.

91
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,879
Go find your true "Dear".

92
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,079
Some time ago, in Laifu Inn,

93
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,879
there was a mysterious person.

94
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,839
This is their proprietor.

95
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,040
I wonder

96
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,319
if you have seen this person.

97
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,279
(Hua Jiuye?)

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,399
(They are looking for him?)

99
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,000
(So he has the Gold Osmanthus Toad.)

100
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,879
(Luckily, he's no longer here.)

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,279
Miss Shen, you know him?

102
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,759
It's him!

103
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,480
You've seen him?

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,439
Not just that.

105
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,480
Not long ago,

106
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,680
he stayed and ate here without paying.

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,720
And when we asked for payment,

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,959
he ran away.

109
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,560
Dear,

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
don't get angry.

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
I will definitely find him.

112
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,439
Then thank you, Mr. Su.

113
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,639
What about you?

114
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,680
Have you ever seen him?

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,199
It's not him.

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Thanks for paying attention.

117
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,399
Thank you.

118
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,959
Dear,

119
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,519
I have a plan. We...

120
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,879
You haven't fully recovered yet.

121
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,800
Take a good rest.

122
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,160
(Why has it suddenly become like this?)

123
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,976
(Breeze Inn)

124
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,720
Call out your proprietor.

125
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,639
Just say

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,600
her fiance is looking for her.

127
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,920
I want to talk to your proprietor.

128
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
And may I ask who you are?

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,000
His fiancee.

130
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,879
Indeed, a playboy.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,560
Quite a flirtatious woman.

132
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,040
How dare you insult her?

133
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,759
I'll let you pay for that.

134
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,160
Then let's see
who gets chopped into pieces first.

135
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
As a young girl, you're quite strong.

136
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,199
Interesting.

137
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
What was that?

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
It is surely

139
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,680
something that will make you bow down.

140
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,399
You!

141
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,000
I will kill you!

142
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,000
I have also seen a few suspicious ones.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,199
Maybe we should ask around some more.

144
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,879
Hua Jiuye?

145
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,199
How dare you be here?

146
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
Hand over the thing now!

147
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,199
Noisy.

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,680
Senior, be careful.

149
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,560
Dear, be careful!

150
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,040
I'll count to three,

151
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,279
and we will withdraw at the same time.

152
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,079
One,

153
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,439
two,

154
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,120
three!

155
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,000
Senior,

156
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
the poison is taking effect.

157
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,959
Hand over the Poison Emperor!

158
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,160
Apart from me,

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,600
no one else can touch him.

160
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,399
Hurry up and go.

161
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,920
Senior,

162
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,279
let's go.

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,480
I don't think you can escape.

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,080
Do not put the cart before the horse.

165
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,519
Put it down.

166
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,559
I'll go get your medicine.

167
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,399
Yuanjiang King?

168
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,600
(It seems something is about to happen.)

169
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,399
What is your relationship
with those Yuanjiang people?

170
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,320
Why?

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,200
Are you going to help me deal with them?

172
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,559
The Poison Emperor,

173
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,039
which is also known as
the Gold Osmanthus Toad,

174
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,200
do you have it?

175
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,480
Why do you ask?

176
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,960
Your recent outbreak is related to it,

177
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,879
isn't it?

178
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't think I don't know

179
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,879
what you've been up to lately.

180
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,960
Zhili,

181
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,840
he's not worth it.

182
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,120
I have my own judgement.

183
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,200
Give me the Poison Emperor.

184
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
Sure.

185
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,159
Unless you marry me.

186
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
Hua Jiuye,

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,639
how can you still

188
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,480
think about getting married now?

189
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,320
Why don't you want to marry me?

190
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,759
Are you in love with someone else?

191
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,000
I see.

192
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,559
Have you taken a fancy to him?

193
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,120
Have you gotten used to him
calling you "Dear"?

194
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,639
Do you want to marry him?

195
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,200
What does it have to do with him?

196
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,720
I've heard

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,559
that he calls you "Dear"
because he lost his memory.

198
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,039
He has a fiancee named Ye Qianqian.

199
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,320
That's the woman outside the door!

200
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,639
Have you been cured of the poison?

201
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,519
Forget it.

202
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,600
It's all or nothing.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,639
If I kill him,
all these troubles will be gone.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't you dare!

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,120
This is a lethal acupoint.

206
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,639
I know.

207
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,240
It seems

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,279
someone has been hit by the love poison.

209
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,759
He and I

210
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,759
are just physician and patient.

211
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,080
Do patients call physician "Dear"?

212
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,960
The reason I allow him to call me that

213
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,919
is because I have made some sort of

214
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,759
deal with him.

215
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,799
Deal?

216
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,399
Are you sure

217
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,960
you don't love him?

218
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
If not, that's for the best.

219
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Then marry

220
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,840
me.

221
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,200
I surely believe so.

222
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,759
After all,

223
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,399
Physician Shen is the renowned Lord
of the Huichun Valley.

224
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
You wouldn't degrade
yourself to an affair.

225
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,320
(Just a deal?)

226
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,759
(You really have no feelings for him?)

227
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,720
Master,

228
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,799
I was being silly.

229
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,960
Next,

230
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
I must find the other two
core ingredients,

231
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,559
so I can revive you

232
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,799
as soon as possible.

233
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,424
(Heaven No. 4)

234
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,480
How dare you.

235
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,840
Senior?

236
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,080
(Such a heavy scent of blood.)

237
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,399
Dear.

238
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
- You?
- Yes, me.

239
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,320
After being here for so long,

240
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,440
it seems we haven't
talked about the past.

241
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Between you and I,

242
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,159
there's no past to recount.

243
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,879
You seem to like Shen Zhili quite a bit.

244
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,840
But now people believe we're together.

245
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,759
Are you planning to commit a murder?

246
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,679
Do you think I would not kill you?

247
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,279
You merely want to use me
to break away from the Cult.

248
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,440
I can let bygones be bygones.

249
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
But if you keep doing this,

250
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,240
do not blame me for being rude.

251
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,039
You should go.

252
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,120
Tonight is the night of the full moon.

253
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
My poison is acting up again.

254
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,080
(Why does it feel different?)

255
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,200
What was that?

256
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
It is surely

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,960
something that will make you bow down.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,440
I thought he had poisoned me,

259
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,519
but it turned out to be a pill
for replenishment.

260
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,519
Senior?

261
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,919
Hua Jiuye!

262
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,399
Yuanjiang King?

263
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,799
(Hua Liancheng, the Yuanjiang King)
Yes.

264
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,879
I am

265
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,919
Hua Jiuye's uncle,

266
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,399
Hua Liancheng.

267
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,679
Uncle?

268
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,240
Hua Jiuye

269
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,360
is unbridled,

270
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,720
impervious to soft or hard tactics.

271
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,919
If he persists in this way,

272
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,799
I'm afraid his life can't be guaranteed.

273
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,480
What you're saying sounds

274
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,799
indeed like you're considering for him.

275
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,159
But in the end,

276
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,840
isn't it still for the Poison Emperor?

277
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,399
As you say,

278
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,759
I just want the Poison Emperor.

279
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,799
Then where is he?

280
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,399
The Grand Elder has taken him
to Mansha Land.

281
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,399
Mansha Land?

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,159
That is our stronghold in Central Plain.

283
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,480
Now I just want to get
the Poison Emperor as soon as possible,

284
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,960
whether it is handed over willingly

285
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,000
or taken by killing.

286
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,039
The rest

287
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,600
is up to you.

288
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,080
(Why does he also have
this scent of medicine?)

289
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,759
If we don't go now, it'll be too late.

290
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,320
(Forget it.)

291
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,559
(Finding Hua Jiuye is more urgent.)

292
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,919
(Ye Qianqian?)

293
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,960
(There is indeed something going on
between them.)

294
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,919
(She didn't see us just now, did she?)

295
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,879
Dear,

296
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,840
listen to me.

297
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,799
Dear!

298
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,279
Yuanjiang King?

299
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,960
As the Yuanjiang King,

300
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,559
you're alone in the inn.

301
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
Aren't you afraid of danger?

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,399
There is no need for outsiders
to worry about this.

303
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,279
(This won't do.)

304
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,919
(I must hurry to find Zhili,)

305
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,159
(in case she got in any danger.)

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,279
Senior.

307
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,080
Senior!

308
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
Senior,

309
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,480
how are you doing?

310
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,159
The pulse is weak and unstable.

311
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,039
Senior, wake up.

312
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,159
Wake up!

313
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,200
I am begging you!

314
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
Wake up, please.

315
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
You are my only

316
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,360
family in this world.

317
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,200
Senior?

318
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,919
Senior,

319
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,320
wake up, please!

320
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,880
I will save you.

321
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,160
I will take you away first.

322
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,200
Dear,

323
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,039
sorry I'm late.

324
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,160
