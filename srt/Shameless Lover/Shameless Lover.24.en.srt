10

=Episode 24=

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,240
How about I...

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,000
Gentlemen,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,640
are you there?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,119
Gentlemen,

15
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,200
I am sorry for just now.

16
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,520
I brought my husband

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,960
to make an apology.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,079
This is

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
our finest tea,

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,719
harvested before Qingming.

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,679
Please have a taste.

22
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,439
Consider it a token of my apology.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,200
Seeing my wife being bullied just now,

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,560
I got a bit anxious.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,319
Please forgive me.

26
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,000
Apologize.

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,959
How did I teach you before?

28
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,400
You must

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
apologize sincerely.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,280
You must bow down.

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,359
Dear, it hurts.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,079
I can't deal with you, right?

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,560
If you don't apologize properly,

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,439
I won't let you off.

35
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,000
You...

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,359
- Stop there.
- How can you hit me?

37
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,359
Ma'am,

38
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:40,959
stop it.

39
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,680
Talk it over.

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
We're fine.

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,319
Please don't interfere.

42
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:44,920
Today,

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
I must offer you a satisfactory apology.

44
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,439
I...

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,359
Stop right there.

46
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,159
You!

47
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:54,799
(We found Yuanjiang King.)

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,480
(Withdraw!)

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,599
Sorry.

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,879
I am truly sorry.

51
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,959
I was really provoked by him.

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,680
Today,

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,159
it was our fault.

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,159
You two take a good rest first.

55
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,439
We will bring you something to eat.

56
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,512
Let's go.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,879
Elder,

58
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,240
they're being weird.

59
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,280
No matter what,

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,080
be alert.

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,719
Yes.

62
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,240
Our people pretended to be

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
like the young man you described

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,680
and appeared within ten miles.

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
The seven elders
and most of the Yuanjiang guards

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,879
have already been lured out.

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,680
It's just...

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,000
Just what?

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,199
That Grand Elder and that lecher

70
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,800
have been in his room all along.

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,680
A few guards

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,199
who appear to be strong

73
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,479
also remained in the inn.

74
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,319
It seems they are very cautious.

75
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,080
We must find a way to draw them away.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
I have a plan.

77
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
Dear.

78
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,159
He's here.

79
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,719
He's here!

80
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,479
Who is it?

81
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,599
Who's here?

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,280
Hua Jiuye.

83
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,000
(Does it really work?)

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,719
(Continue.)

85
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,199
Who is it?

86
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,039
Who's here?

87
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,400
Hua Jiuye!

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,159
Hua Jiuye has come.

89
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,120
Dear,

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,039
get some people

91
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,560
to capture him with me.

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,360
He'll escape later.

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,599
Okay.

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,759
He has finally appeared.

95
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,800
I'll get people now.

96
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,439
Let's go.

97
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,800
Please hold on.

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,360
What does Hua Jiuye
you mentioned look like?

99
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,319
Any features?

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,159
Quite ordinary.

101
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,159
Nothing special.

102
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,000
What's the matter?

103
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,639
Is this him?

104
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,199
Yes.

105
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
How do you have his portrait?

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Allow me to ask,

107
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
why are you two looking for him?

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,759
Here is the thing.

109
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,159
This person had stayed here

110
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
for a while not too long ago.

111
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,599
When it was time to settle the bill,

112
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,199
he suddenly disappeared.

113
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,800
He has owed us room fee
for half a month.

114
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
So that's how it is.

115
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,159
How about I let my subordinate

116
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,800
take his man to accompany you?

117
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,759
No way.

118
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,480
We have our own staff.

119
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,079
Exactly.

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,199
Ma'am. It's alright.

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
We're friends now.

122
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,600
Since I've accepted your gift,

123
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,680
it's only natural to reciprocate.

124
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,800
In that case,

125
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,199
I shall respectfully comply.

126
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,879
Please take a short rest.

127
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,000
We'll make some preparations

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,959
and depart immediately.

129
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
Thank you.

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Dear,

131
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,079
it looks like

132
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,600
the Grand Elder won't be leaving.

133
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,079
Then we...

134
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,800
Rest assured.

135
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I have my own ways.

136
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,399
Alright.

137
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,920
If you encounter danger,

138
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,480
you must fire

139
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,040
the signal flare I gave you.

140
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,920
Be very careful.

141
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,000
(The Grand Elder has been lured out.)

142
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,879
(Everything is ready.)

143
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,639
(Take action now.)

144
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,279
(It's not him!)

145
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,800
Wait.

146
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,199
We are five miles away from the city.

147
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,480
Where exactly are you taking us?

148
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
It's just ahead.

149
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,399
Almost there.

150
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,000
You think I would believe your trick?

151
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
(Red!)

152
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,000
(She's in danger.)

153
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,879
Stop!

154
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,439
Who's there?

155
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,712
Dear,

156
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
I shouldn't have shown my skill.

158
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,160
You're hurt.

159
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,199
It's nothing.

160
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,040
Where else?

161
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,600
They're all minor ones.

162
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,519
No need to worry.

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,319
Come back with me.

164
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,199
I'll tend your wounds.

165
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,439
Give me your arm.

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Let's check your neck.

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
But your injuries are more serious.

168
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,920
Let's check your neck first.

169
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
How about this?

170
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,480
I treat you.

171
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,319
You treat me.

172
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,759
We treat each other simultaneously.

173
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,480
Is that alright?

174
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,199
It is all right.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm just afraid you'll die.

176
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
If time resets,

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
we have to start over.

178
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:27,959
Yeah.

179
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,000
I know.

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,519
You know?

181
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,439
I only know

182
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,759
what you are doing now,
and what you are thinking.

183
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,319
The things you want me to know,

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,319
I do know.

185
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
The things you don't want me to know,

186
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,800
I don't know.

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
You go babbling again.

188
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,360
Alright.

189
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:00,120
Elder,

190
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I've checked.

191
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
Not a single survivor.

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,519
This must be related to that innkeeper.

193
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,160
Let's go.

194
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,680
Yes.

195
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,079
You've come at the right time.

196
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,959
Kill them!

197
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes!

198
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
Who dares to move!

199
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,439
So many of their people have died.

200
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,879
They will surely suspect us.

201
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,759
What should we do?

202
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,160
Then let's give them

203
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,800
a preemptive strike.

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
It was them.

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,759
Out of nowhere,

206
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,399
they caused the loss of so many lives.

207
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,320
Now our inn

208
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,000
can't even conduct business anymore.

209
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,759
People from Yuanjiang

210
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,559
are allowed to entry Central Plain,

211
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,919
but causing trouble is forbidden.

212
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,159
This is an official decree.

213
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,200
Violators will be executed immediately.

214
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,559
They intend to cause trouble

215
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,960
and even kill us!

216
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,559
Guards.

217
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,480
Yes.

218
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,000
Take them away for interrogation.

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
Yes.

220
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
This is a misunderstanding!

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,879
It's all a misunderstanding.

222
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,320
We've come to this place,

223
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,200
so we will abide by local rules.

224
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,679
Ma'am,

225
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,960
please show mercy.

226
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,320
Let's not bother the authorities.

227
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,399
Considering you are foreigners,

228
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,480
I don't wish to make things difficult.

229
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,440
Thank you.

230
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,799
Thank you a lot.

231
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,600
What do you suggest we do?

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,279
A set of good tables and chairs,

233
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,000
a set of jadeite washbasins,

234
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,600
a Nanhuai wooden door,

235
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,200
and four agate teacups.

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,720
These doors and windows need
to be repaired for a few days.

237
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
It's just that...

238
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,159
That's right.

239
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,720
The items in this room

240
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,759
are even more expensive.

241
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,639
Be careful.

242
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,360
Elder,

243
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,879
giving them so much money?

244
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,600
Isn't this just extortion?

245
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,399
How dare they extort me?

246
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
I'll make sure they live to take it,

247
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,679
but not live to spend it.

248
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,440
Go.

249
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,032
Understood.

250
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,559
They'll likely make a move.

251
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,440
Dear, don't worry

252
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm with you.

253
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,879
Before Mr. Li sends a message,

254
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,120
let's not complicate matters.

255
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,159
We need a way to hold them off.

256
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,399
Have you applied medicine to your wound?

257
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,159
It's a minor wound.

258
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,879
Almost healed.

259
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,080
Xiaocui, Xiaocui!

260
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,159
You only look for her.

261
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,720
She has already moved away!

262
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,200
Don't mention her anymore!

263
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,480
Come on.

264
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,759
Enjoy your meal.

265
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:40,919
Come on.

266
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,080
I propose a toast to you.

267
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,759
Dear,

268
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,200
today we have made a fortune.

269
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,399
Let's celebrate.

270
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,960
The dishes are ready.

271
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,360
Ma'am,

272
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,559
this is the last dish.

273
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
Mr. Li said

274
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,080
the clue is under the pillow.

275
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,399
Ma'am, please enjoy.

276
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,159
If you need anything else, just ask.

277
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,879
Alright.

278
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,320
Come on.

279
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,360
That's about it.

280
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,600
Dear,

281
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,039
you've had too much to drink.

282
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,240
Let's go.

283
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,159
Let's go upstairs and back to the room.

284
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,759
Okay.

285
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,048
Let's go.

286
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,840
You didn't need to walk me back.

287
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,919
I should.

288
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,200
You are

289
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
not safe on your own.

290
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,256
It's the 15th day of the lunar month.

291
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,919
Dear,

292
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,440
I've long wished

293
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,120
for a child of our own.

294
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,320
It's been three years.

295
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,200
Everyone knows you can't do it.

296
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,840
You!

297
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:43,399
(King is in Mansha Land.
Here's the map.)

298
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,879
(Yuanjiang King is in Mansha Land.)

299
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,799
(Here's the map.)

300
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Let's take action.

301
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,559
People from Yuanjiang?

302
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,639
Why haven't they started to act?

303
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,799
Then I'll deal with those two first.

304
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,720
Have some tea.

305
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
(Why did you send him away?)

306
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,840
(It's you who wanted that.)

307
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,919
(I just did the favor.)

308
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,039
You two stop

309
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,440
making eyes at each other.

310
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,679
Someone should explain it to me.

311
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,600
Why exactly sent me away?

312
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,848
You,

313
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,440
tell me.

314
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,200
You,

315
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,399
get out of here.

316
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,559
Senior,

317
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,279
actually...

318
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,519
First tell me

319
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,000
about the wound on your neck.

320
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:27,960
It's nothing.

321
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,840
Come clean.

322
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Senior,

323
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,159
when you came over just now,

324
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,759
you must have seen
those people from Yuanjiang.

325
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,600
Do you know what they're here for?

326
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,399
Looking for me?

327
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,840
Searching for Gold Osmanthus Toad?

328
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,296
So,

329
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,440
you drew the Poison Emperor to yourself,

330
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,639
then you sent me away

331
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,320
to protect me?

332
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,200
Since the Poison Emperor is on you,

333
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,279
and I'm not here,

334
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,639
why did you come here

335
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,000
to deal with them?

336
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,519
Because I want to find Yuanjiang King

337
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,840
and the remains of your family.

338
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,039
You decided it on your own?

339
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,159
Gold Osmanthus Toad is mine,

340
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,679
and the family is also mine.

341
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,720
Why should you...

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,799
Senior,

343
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,600
because you are also my family.

344
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm sorry.

345
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,279
Are you all right?

346
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:44,879
It's nothing.

347
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,559
But,

348
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,720
if you dare to delay my plan,

349
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,000
I won't forgive you.

350
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,320
Tonight's plans?

351
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,840
Useless!

352
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,519
It seems I have to do it myself.

353
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Nobody is here.

354
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,072
No one.

355
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,600
Physician Shen really has
excellent strategies.

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,799
Senior,

357
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,039
why did you come?

358
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,799
Since this is related to me,

359
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,559
I had to come.

360
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,759
Moreover,

361
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,720
he alone

362
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,480
can't protect you.

363
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,648
You!

364
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,440
They are coming.

365
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,919
You go first.

366
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,799
What about you?

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,879
I'll find you shortly.

368
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,639
Then be careful.

369
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,559
Su Chenche.

370
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,039
Go ahead.

371
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,519
Charge!

372
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,000
Unexpectedly,

373
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,160
People from Yuanjiang

374
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,359
have such a place in the Central Plain.

375
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:43,904
Wait.

376
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,759
They are good at using poisons.

377
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,160
Eat this.

378
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,039
Just in case.
