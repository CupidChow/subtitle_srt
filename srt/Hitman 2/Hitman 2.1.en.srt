00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,438
Hello everyone, I'm Cho Soo-bin from the news.

10
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:49,354
Today, we've invited Kim Soo-hyuk,
the creator of the webtoon 'Agent Jun'.

11
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,271
Welcome.

12
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,021
- Hello.
- I'm Kim Soo-hyuk, a webtoon artist.

13
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:54,354
Congratulations on winning the grand prize.

14
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,154
Thank you.

15
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:57,877
An agent who became a webtoon artist.

16
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,927
What inspired you to draw 'Agent Jun'?

17
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:04,177
My daughter told me to tell my story,

18
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:06,011
saying she thought it would be interesting.

19
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,394
- And that's how I got the idea.
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:12,311
So I made the main character a webtoon artist,
like me.

21
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:14,394
You should give your daughter a bigger allowance.

22
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,428
Yes.

23
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:19,521
There's a rumor going around on social media now

24
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:22,894
that the artist is actually a
real national intelligence agent.

25
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:24,594
Have you heard about it?

26
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:26,094
Oh, really?

27
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:28,573
How could that be?

28
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:29,727
Absolutely impossible.

29
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:33,477
I wouldn't shoot people like Agent Jun.

30
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,038
- I'm very timid.
- Mm-hmm.

31
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,811
I couldn't even kill an ant.

32
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:39,720
Now that I see you in person...

33
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:44,238
You have a great physique,
very similar to Agent Jun.

34
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:45,978
I can understand why there are such rumors.

35
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,394
Actually...

36
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:51,611
Before everyone knew me from this webtoon

37
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:55,094
I went through a lot of hardships.

38
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:57,561
- I did all sorts of things.
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:59,511
Actually, like Jun...

40
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,704
I've suffered even more hardships than him.

41
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:03,728
But...

42
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:05,311
Those around me...

43
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:09,011
My wife, my daughter.

44
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:10,628
Well...

45
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:11,677
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:15,011
You could say it's a responsibility.

47
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:19,177
Truly, great work comes from experience.

48
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:23,794
Many fans are now anticipating your next work.

49
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,644
Please say a few words.

50
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:33,237
This is the 4B pencil I use for drawing.

51
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:34,927
To stay true to my roots

52
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:36,977
I always carry it with me.

53
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:41,227
In the future, I'll also become a webtoon
artist who stays true to their roots.

54
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:43,278
Also,

55
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:48,311
I'll soon meet everyone
through Season 2 of 'Agent Jun'.

56
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:49,545

Are you going to Korea to make money?

71
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:57,795
No.

72
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,311
I have a debt to collect.

73
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,927
Sounds like a pretty big debt?

74
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,561
You even have to sneak across the border.

75
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:08,712
Very big.

76
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:11,761
Big enough to trade a life for.

77
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:30,311
Catch them!

78
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,261
Hey, kid.

79
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:49,545
What now?

80
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:51,844
You won't be able to collect your debt.

81
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:53,762
Come with me.

82
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:57,511
Ow, that hurts!

83
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:58,427
Fuck!

84
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,988

Ow, that hurts!

86
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,462
I'll kill you!

87
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:06,977
Too slow...

88
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,311
I told you you were slow.

89
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,477
Come meet your end!

90
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:23,977

91
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,261

Hello, Jun.

93
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:33,077
Chief.

94
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,194
You didn't forget about my wife's exhibition,
did you?

95
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,794
How could I forget, you punk?

96
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,827
It's the first one she's
organizing since becoming manager.

97
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:39,738
Don't be late, and don't come empty-handed.

98
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,411
Show some appreciation.

99
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:42,461

Got it.

101
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,661
I won't call Cheol separately then.

102
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:46,911
Ultimate move!

103
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:50,361
Okay, I'll tell Cheol.

104
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,994
Got it. See you tomorrow.

105
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:02,994
Chief, did you see that?

106
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:04,411
Amazing!

107
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:07,911
Hey! Grab him!

108
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:16,878
Chief,

109
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,927
shouldn't we tell Jun?

110
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:19,771
Tell him what?

111
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:22,604
Those guys smuggled themselves
in just to kill him.

112
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,311
Who knows what'll happen next?

113
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:25,404
Cheol.

114
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:26,428
Yes?

115
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,561
Jun's an ordinary person now.

116
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,045
He's just a webtoon artist.

117
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,794
What if he gets into danger like before?

118
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:33,894
We have to protect him.

119
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,961
He finally found his place.

120
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,727
He worked so hard for the life he has now.

121
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:38,844
We have to protect him.

122
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:42,427
Let him do what he wants.

123
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,545
Chief.

124
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,345
What's

125
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:53,878
that smell?

126
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:56,644
What's that smell?

127
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:57,678
Chief.

128
00:08:58,795 --> 00:08:59,800
Chief!

129
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,144
Cheers!

130
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,677
- Eat more.
- Mm.

131
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,361
Speaking of which,

132
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:11,688
you're really amazing.

133
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:12,354
What's so amazing?

134
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:14,104
You love drinking so much, yet you can handle it.

135
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,594
I'm a woman who keeps her word.

136
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:18,461
How's the gallery?

137
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:19,354
Are you happy?

138
00:09:19,378 --> 00:09:20,321
Yeah.

139
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,711
I like looking at the art.

140
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,188
The people around are all very nice.

141
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:26,627
Planning every exhibition
myself is really interesting.

142
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:27,795
So, you're happy then?

143
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:28,444
Mm-hmm.

144
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,221
I'm really happy.

145
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,911
This is all because you succeeded

146
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:33,554
I get to do what I want.

147
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:36,994
It's all thanks to Cartoonist Kim.

148
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:38,077
Thank you.

149
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,028
Honey?

150
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:41,794
- He's here.
- You're back.

151
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:44,461
- Come here.
- Eat some fried chicken!

152
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:45,244
No, I'm not hungry.

153
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,444
Want me to get you some juice?

154
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:47,327
I'm going to my room first.

155
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:48,244
I still have things to do.

156
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,261
Are you writing rap lyrics?

157
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:51,644
I want to study...

158
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:53,144
Why the sudden urge to study?

159
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:53,871
Didn't you want to be a rapper?

160
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:54,521
So go rap!

161
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:56,144
Do what you want to do. Like me.

162
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,344
Use rap to say everything you want to say.

163
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,177
Go inside and study.

164
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:03,511
Hey, you...

165
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:04,994
Stop it.

166
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,544
Is she going through puberty?

167
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:18,611
Thank you all sincerely for
taking the time to be here.

168
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:22,827
Now, let me introduce today's main guest,
artist Yu Jae-yeon.

169
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:25,277
Hello everyone. I'm Yu Jae-yeon.

170
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,777
The weather is so lovely today.

171
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:31,361
Thank you all sincerely
for taking the time to come.

172
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:33,667
I'm truly touched.

173
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:34,744
Thank you all.

174
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:43,211
My wife is so beautiful.

175
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,461
I'm the only man she's ever had.

176
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:48,827
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

177
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:49,933
It's okay, Honey.

178
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:52,694
As long as things are like this

179
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,327
I ask for nothing else.

180
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:57,161
Such a simple woman.

181
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,577
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

182
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:12,327
Ga-yeong...

183
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:13,427
When did you get here?

184
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:14,504
Just now.

185
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:15,627
Sister-in-law!

186
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:18,911
Are you okay?

187
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,245
I'm fine.

188
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,194
Congratulations on your exhibition.

189
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,671
Thank you.

190
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,077
You didn't have to bring a gift.

191
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,464
There are so many people.

192
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:28,944
Looks like the exhibition is a success.

193
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,211
Yes. Thank you.

194
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:31,254
Chief.

195
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:32,761
This is so embarrassing.

196
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:33,961
Are you here for the housewarming party?

197
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:36,011
Why bring toilet paper?

198
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:36,877
You can use it in the restroom.

199
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:37,804
Thank you.

200
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:38,604
Sister-in-law!

201
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:39,461
Be careful.

202
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:40,462
Sister-in-law!

203
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:42,894
I'm so sorry.

204
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,394
Are you okay?

205
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:45,271
Sister-in-law.

206
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,011
Be careful.

207
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,904
Congratulations. Wishing you all the best.

208
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:50,011
You didn't have to bring a gift.

209
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:51,160
There are so many people.

210
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:54,194
Looks like the exhibition is a success.

211
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,061
- Yes.
- Thank you.

212
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:56,977
How come you two look more and more alike?

213
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:57,978
- What?
- What?

214
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:01,111
- What are you talking about?
- Seriously.

215
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,277
How much is something like this?

216
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:09,977
- You're here.
- Yes.

217
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:13,927
This is the director of our gallery.

218
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:17,344
My name is Hae-in.

219
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,261
I see.

220
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:23,878
Hold on.

221
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:25,594
Hold on.

222
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,094
Why don't you two chat first.

223
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,311
Oh, okay.

224
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:42,494
I heard you're a good friend of Mi-na's husband?

225
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:46,077
Good friends? More like an ill-fated relationship.

226
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:47,695
So...

227
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:49,294
are you a cartoonist?

228
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:51,944
No, I'm not.

229
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,127
I teach at a university.

230
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:55,627
What subject do you teach?

231
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,544
Public Administration.

232
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,261
Seems like a good fit for you.

233
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:01,438
Mm.

234
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:04,570
You're so handsome.

235
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:06,311
Your students must love you.

236
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:09,394
Doesn't your wife worry?

237
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:10,644
I'm single.

238
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:12,477
Are you divorced?

239
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:13,644
Never been married.

240
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:15,131
No way.

241
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:16,144
I don't believe it.

242
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,861
I'm married to the country.

243
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,411
Seriously...

244
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:24,994
And funny too.

245
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:37,927
You should dress up a bit.

246
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:42,794
A tie would really suit you.

247
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:45,844
I'll pick out a tie for you later.

248
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,594
Dressed up a little bit,

249
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,344
even Brad Pitt couldn't compare.

250
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,271
Ah...

251
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,511
Of course, you look handsome now too.

252
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:56,277
Remember to contact me.

253
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,161
Isn't this just scribbled trash?

254
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:09,527
What kind of artwork is this?

255
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:13,244
Picasso spent four years
learning to paint like Raphael,

256
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,961
but spent a lifetime learning
to paint like a child.

257
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:18,511
To paint like a child

258
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:22,161
It seems you're very interested in art.

259
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:25,177
Very interested in art.

260
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:29,595
Excuse me.

261
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:30,794
I love you.

262
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,277
- Eh?
- Eh.

263
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:34,027
No, no...

264
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:36,538
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,227
This... this...

266
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:39,861
I'm sorry. Please...

267
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:44,244
It's alright.

268
00:14:52,578 --> 00:14:53,744
My name is Hae-in.

269
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:55,994
I'll wash these clothes and return them to you.

270
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,461
Remember to contact me.

271
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:08,894
I love you.

272
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:18,694
That... Pierre Jean?

273
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:19,681
Yes.

274
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,894
He's a very famous collector from abroad.

275
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,061
Rumor has it his personal collection

276
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:28,027
is more impressive than
renowned overseas museums.

277
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,744
I mean...

278
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,361
That Pierre Jean going to exhibit

279
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,994
his personal collection in our museum?

280
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:36,912
Ms. Mi-na...

281
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:41,304
He's the most important
VVIP our gallery has ever had.

282
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,894
Yes, I'll give it my all.

283
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,977
Don't worry.

284
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:54,011
Who else wants to kill Jun?

285
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,127
Do you think it's just one or two?

286
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,128
Speak up, you bastard!

287
00:15:58,845 --> 00:15:59,845
You think I'm going to talk?

288
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:01,444
Talk, you bastard!

289
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:03,911
You really are a bastard.

290
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,277
Talk!

291
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:11,194
Talk, damn you!

292
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:12,827
What should we get to eat?

293
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,994
How about sushi?

294
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,044
I know a good place.

295
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,077
Forget eating. How about drinks?

296
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:21,161
What?

297
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:22,511
You don't drink?

298
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:23,627
I can drink a lot.

299
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:44,611
Editor-in-chief, I've sent you the files.

300
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:47,811
I'll check them.
If there are no issues, I'll upload them.

301
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,144
- Thanks.
- Okay.

302
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:50,354
Hey, Cartoonist Kim...

303
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:51,378
Yes?

304
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:52,894
It's nothing.

305
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,379
Good work.

306
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,561
You must've pulled several all-nighters.

307
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:56,621
Get some good sleep.

308
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:57,561
Come to the office when you wake up.

309
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:58,562
The office?

310
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,027
Sure.

311
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:02,178
Okay.

312
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,711
Are you okay?

313
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:21,510
Post it.

314
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:24,951
[Agent Jun 2]

315
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:48,411
Agent Jun, so bold. Walking right into a trap.

316
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:55,327
Damn it!

317
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,888
Jun, you're not alone.

318
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:57,838
Chief.

319
00:17:57,862 --> 00:17:59,744
Leave this to us.

320
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,104
Secret weapon. Weapon No. 2.

321
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:06,111
Chief, initiate teleport!

322
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,394
Weapon No. 2, teleport approved.

323
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:10,361
Teleporting...

324
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:17,544
Weapon No. 2, fire!

325
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:22,961
Damn that Shield Team.

326
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:27,227
Robert.

327
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,377
Your end has come.

328
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:32,794
Ridiculous fool. You can't possibly stop me.

329
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:35,761
Come down and face justice!

330
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:44,777
Everything is ready, Jun.

331
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,477
Chief, requesting backup!

332
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:52,528
Listen.

333
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,411
We miscalculated.

334
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:58,161
Chief! Chief!

335
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:00,411
Who are you looking for, Jun?

336
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:03,161
Shield Team is already in ruins.

337
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,561
This is what happens when you challenge me.

338
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,562
Chief!

339
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:08,827
Shield Team...

340
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:14,077
Unforgivable!

341
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:38,427
You're not the only one with
a hidden special weapon, Jun.

342
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:56,294
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed.

343
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,611
You dare make me show up in person?

344
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,327
You useless trash.

345
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:09,011
To be continued...

346
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:12,294
- Wait.
- Wow, this content is infuriating.

347
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,577
This is complete trash.

348
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:15,511
The content is so stupid. You like this stuff?

349
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:19,044
- Total garbage.
- This is so boring.

350
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,911
If it's so boring, why bother reading it?

351
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,827
The comments are actually more
interesting than the webtoon.

352
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,127
<i>It's completely changed.</i>

353
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:35,744
<i>Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four...</i>

354
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,961
<i>I almost fainted reading it. They should just die.</i>

355
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:40,461
<i>This really is garbage.</i>

356
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:53,794
Hello everyone.

357
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:56,745
So busy.

358
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,144
Hello.

359
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,977
- Editor-in-Chief.
- You're here.

360
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:05,845
It's me.

361
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:07,262
Let's talk.

362
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:09,061
Looks like everyone's busy.

363
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:11,144
We're not busy because of you.

364
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,244
Stopping the serialization?

365
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:15,311
Are you kidding?

366
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,577
If I'd known,
I would've just ended it last season.

367
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:20,544
Why all of a sudden?

368
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,161
Don't you read the comments?

369
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:23,971
I don't.

370
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,161
I'm afraid I'll impulsively kill
those guys who write bad reviews.

371
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:27,527
These guys are really...

372
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:28,761
Show me the comments! Let me see!

373
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:30,027
Bear with it.

374
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:31,311
Just bear with it.

375
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:32,977
You don't need to be so angry.

376
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,977
Sit down.

377
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,677
I know. I know.

378
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,544
Of course, I know you're really
the secret agent, Jun.

379
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:41,927
That's why I couldn't tell you because I'm afraid.

380
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:43,427
These comments are...

381
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,777
What it is...

382
00:21:46,928 --> 00:21:48,511
Weren't the sales figures supposed to be good?

383
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:50,744
Compared to the ratings,
sales are naturally a bit higher.

384
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,061
But do you know why?

385
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,944
It's because some people are paying

386
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:57,277
just to leave you bad reviews.

387
00:21:57,278 --> 00:21:58,311
Get what I mean?

388
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:00,127
What kind of people do that?

389
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:02,194
If this keeps up it'll be a total flop.

390
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:05,744
And when you release your next work,
you'll be finished.

391
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:08,994
So let's just scrap this one

392
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,244
and start something new.

393
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:12,094
Think about it carefully.

394
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:14,627
- Editor-in-Chief.
- Yeah?

395
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:17,877
Can I get my manuscript fee in advance?

396
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,766
Advance?

397
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,665
What?

398
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:21,227
Do you think I'm joking?

399
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:22,894
You're lucky I'm not docking your pay.

400
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:24,488
After I bought that stock you recommended...

401
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,861
I lost so much I don't know which way is up!

402
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:26,362
Quiet down.

403
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,510
10 times the profit?

404
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:28,534
10 times!

405
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:30,627
You said it would pay off right away!

406
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:33,694
Be quiet.

407
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:34,777
What if they hear us?

408
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:36,627
I mortgaged the house.

409
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:37,211
If my wife finds out

410
00:22:37,212 --> 00:22:37,877
she'll definitely divorce me.

411
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,294
Will you take responsibility then? Will you?

412
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:40,596
Divorce isn't a big deal.

413
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,827
It just takes a stamp.

414
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,544
I need to buy a coffin now.

415
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,712
I mortgaged my house too

416
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,251
and I maxed out all my cards.

417
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:48,411
If my wife finds out I'm dead.

418
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:51,827
Also, I haven't been able to
eat properly at home lately.

419
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:52,971
Why?

420
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:54,494
I'm afraid she'll poison the food.

421
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,128
This is crazy.

422
00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:03,978
What do I do now?

423
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,845
Is this appropriate?

424
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:17,977
- Hello, honey.
- Yes?

425
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:19,777
You know I had to
prepare for a big exhibition, right?

426
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,065
I'm swamped right now.

427
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,494
I'll probably be home very late today.

428
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:24,977
Ga-yeong's cram school class is ending soon.

429
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,161
Go pick her up, okay?

430
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:29,961
Honey, hang in there!

431
00:23:30,162 --> 00:23:31,890
You can do it.

432
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:33,077
Don't overwork yourself.

433
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,461
Your health is the most important thing.

434
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,677
But luckily, we don't have huge debts,

435
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:39,961
unlike others who lose
everything on crypto and stocks.

436
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,414
Right?

437
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:42,827
Don't worry.

438
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:44,544
I only trust you, honey.

439
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:46,477
Got it? Keep going!

440
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,604
If she finds out, I'm really dead.

441
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,827
Are all those cars here to pick up kids?

442
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:10,377
That's really over the top.

443
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:17,877
Ga-yeo...

444
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:19,261
- Ga-yeong!
- You scared me!

445
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,677
That bastard.

446
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,644
- Thanks for your hard work.
- You're here.

447
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:29,027
Oh my god.

448
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:31,828
What the hell?

449
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:45,862
Ga-yeong.

450
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,461
Ga-yeong.

451
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:52,494
I'm going to kill that bastard.

452
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:04,261
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

453
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:07,494
- Then let's go.
- Okay.

454
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:35,778
I'll be going then.

455
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:38,278
Okay.

456
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:40,212
See you tomorrow.

457
00:25:40,745 --> 00:25:41,745
Okay.

458
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:46,530
Good.

459
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:47,554
Go on back. Go home.

460
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:48,878
Ga-yeong.

461
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:01,927
Do you want to have some noodles first?
(Can be a euphemism for a romantic invitation)

462
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,836
Noodles?

463
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,944
No, definitely not.

464
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:08,744
Sure.

465
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:15,073
I'll kill him.

466
00:26:15,602 --> 00:26:17,711
I'll definitely kill that kid.

467
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:25,344
- Isn't it delicious?
- Totally.

468
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:31,295
Eat it with kimchi.

469
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:31,934
Mm.

470
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:32,958
You eat too.

471
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,061
I don't imitate others. I just follow my gut.

472
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,611
Follow my gut, follow my gut.

473
00:26:43,112 --> 00:26:44,527
It sounds cool.

474
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,562
How was that?

475
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,577
Is studying interesting?

476
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:54,328
What?

477
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:56,327
You don't study because it's interesting,

478
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:57,827
you study because you have to.

479
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,327
Studying isn't for you.

480
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:00,577
You should rap.

481
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,244
I haven't given up on rapping.

482
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:05,244
That can just be a hobby.

483
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:06,395
A hobby?

484
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,044
You can't do Hip Hop with that attitude.

485
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:09,561
That's how artists are.

486
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,094
If you don't risk everything,

487
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:14,427
you'll never create great rap.

488
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,427
Have you read the webtoon "Agent Jun"?

489
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,061
The one with the second season?

490
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:24,527
That one's so boring.

491
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:25,977
It's really absolute trash.

492
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,361
Absolute trash.

493
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:31,111
I'm gonna kill you myself!

494
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:33,577
The author is my dad.

495
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:37,293
Sorry!

496
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:38,744
I didn't mean it was trash.

497
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:39,745
No, no.

498
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:41,412
You're right.

499
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,827
Dad's webtoon is trash. Absolute trash.

500
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:46,078
Ga-yeong...

501
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:48,995
Even you?

502
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:50,300
My dad's finished.

503
00:27:50,324 --> 00:27:51,111
Totally finished.

504
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:52,994
No, I'm not.

505
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:53,826
He's your dad.

506
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,044
That's a bit...

507
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:56,677
My dad has nothing left to write about now.

508
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:58,727
I know that.

509
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:00,894
He's written everything he could

510
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:02,394
there's really nothing left to write.

511
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:05,312
It's just garbage.

512
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:07,861
Ga-yeong, that's too harsh.

513
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,062
Let me tell you.

514
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:13,411
My mom has suffered ever since she met my dad.

515
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:18,077
Now she's finally started
doing something she likes.

516
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:21,544
I can't let Mom be the
breadwinner again like before.

517
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,961
So from now on, I'll be the breadwinner.

518
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:28,677
I have to study hard and succeed.

519
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:32,544
I know what you mean.

520
00:28:42,312 --> 00:28:43,636
Look at that guy!

521
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,827
It must be fun.

522
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:46,944
Good grief, what's fun about that?

523
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:48,811
What's going on?

524
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:51,418
How did he get up there?

525
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:52,620
Is he a thief?

526
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:58,045
Too bad.

527
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:01,895
Who are you?

528
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:08,344
I am an agent of justice.

529
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:10,661
Trash belongs in the trash can, kid.

530
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:16,161
Do you understand how
carelessly discarded trash feels?

531
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:18,577
Not all trash is just trash.

532
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:19,410
Huh?

533
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:21,077
You never know when you
might become trash yourself.

534
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:23,027
- Got it?
- Yes, got it.

535
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,927
- I asked if you got it?
- Yes, got it.

536
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,044
Save the noodles for college.

537
00:29:37,795 --> 00:29:39,644
What's up with that asshole?

538
00:29:49,528 --> 00:29:51,077
Ga-yeong, I'm home.

539
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,661
You should say hello.

540
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:00,044
Dad, you're back.

541
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:05,627
Look at me when you say it.

542
00:30:06,578 --> 00:30:07,794
Dad, you're back.

543
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:12,344
Is there anything you want to say to me?

544
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:13,712
Like what?

545
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:20,394
Men are all trash.

546
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:22,294
Except for your dad.

547
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:23,321
They're all trash.

548
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:26,277
- What are you talking about all of a sudden?
- I said they're all trash.

549
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,611
Have you been drinking?

550
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:34,777
Also, when a guy asks if you want

551
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:36,777
to come over for noodles, never say yes.

552
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:37,894
If you ever want noodles

553
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:39,327
then study hard, get into university...

554
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:40,639
No, forget it.

555
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:41,960
Just give up noodles for now.

556
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:44,244
Dad...

557
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:46,210
Were you following me just now?

558
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,245
No.

559
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,413
I knew something felt weird.

560
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:53,477
This is so annoying!

561
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,011
Dad, you're really the worst.

562
00:30:58,378 --> 00:30:59,711
- Dad, get out!
- No.

563
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,761
Get out! Get out!

564
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,121
Guys are all trash except for your Dad!

565
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:09,927
That kid's clearly in high school
but he has bleached hair.

566
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:11,527
Why is he trash?

567
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:13,894
Your webtoon is the real trash.

568
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:16,861
How dare you call my webtoon trash?

569
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,294
I'm still here, you know!

570
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:27,627
I'll show you all what I'm really capable of.

571
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:37,011
You bunch of guys, just you wait!

572
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:43,844
My mind's completely blank.

573
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:46,310
My mind's blank.

574
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,361
I can't draw anything.

575
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:49,744
I can't draw anything.

576
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:22,311
Who are you?

577
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:23,462
Hello there?

578
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:25,595
Excuse me.

579
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:31,828
Grab him!

580
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:39,577
There are so many people. Why use a gun?

581
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:40,744
Grab him bare-handed!

582
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:08,311
Hey kid,

583
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,811
Deok-gyu. Good night.

584
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:13,611
Good night to you too.

585
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:26,694
Smile.

586
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:40,211
Today, let's try to adopt a mindset

587
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:42,910
of letting go of all trivial matters.

588
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:46,394
Okay. Inhale as you raise your arms.

589
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:56,527
Deputy Director, I have something to report.

590
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:01,994
- We'll talk after this.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:13,494
Deputy Director, today two terrorists

592
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:14,627
from a neighboring country
attempted to enter illegally.

593
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:16,660
You...

594
00:34:16,684 --> 00:34:18,085
Why are you only telling me this now?

595
00:34:18,205 --> 00:34:19,734
- I was about to tell you.
- Spit it out!

596
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,441
Chief Cheon and Agent Cheol are escorting them.

597
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:26,511
Those lunatics...

598
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:28,844
Couldn't they wait? Two more stowaways already?

599
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:32,394
It's all that Jun's fault.

600
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:35,344
Drawing webtoons wasn't enough,
he had to go on TV?

601
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,977
Can't he just keep a low profile?

602
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:39,427
Are we still monitoring Jun's family?

603
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:41,494
Per your instructions,
they're under close surveillance.

604
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,777
Wait, closely monitoring them?

605
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,644
Deputy Director,
Jun's family aren't dangerous people.

606
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:47,457
That's right.

607
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:48,710
Jun is a civilian now.

608
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:50,527
He's someone we should be protecting.

609
00:34:50,528 --> 00:34:51,786
Civilian?

610
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,858
That guy's a killing machine.

611
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,147
He's just a webtoon artist.

612
00:34:55,078 --> 00:34:56,661
We're discussing deporting Jun.

613
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,494
Absolutely not!

614
00:34:58,495 --> 00:34:59,910
Why not?

615
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,694
It's the logical choice.

616
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:04,544
If he is gone from this country

617
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:07,218
those lunatics targeting
him won't come here anymore!

618
00:35:07,242 --> 00:35:09,488
Deputy Director, that's completely unreasonable!

619
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:11,544
Why should he bear the burden of
something we should be taking care of?

620
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:13,677
Deputy Director, please reconsider.

621
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,527
Jun's webtoon no longer
threatens national security.

622
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,312
What?

623
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:23,994
Jun isn't writing about his past anymore.

624
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:27,494
He's drawing about his current life now.

625
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:12,538
Hello, Pierre Jean.

626
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:14,444
Welcome to Korea.

627
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:18,544
- Do you speak French?
- Do you speak Korean?

628
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:20,294
Then we don't need an interpreter.

629
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,627
Oh, that's great.

630
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:23,577
I was quite nervous before.

631
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:27,627
Because I only know the greetings.

632
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:30,011
- Greetings are enough.
- Thank you.

633
00:36:30,162 --> 00:36:32,761
This is Ms. Lee Mi-na, the one
in charge of this exhibition.

634
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:36,051
I'm Lee Mi-na.

635
00:36:36,623 --> 00:36:37,911
It's a pleasure to meet you.

636
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:50,611
I'll be in your care.

637
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:07,511
What style are you looking
for for this exhibition?

638
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,344
I want the exhibition to be special.

639
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:15,144
It's the first time I'm publicly
showing my collections.

640
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:17,727
Can you give me some keywords?

641
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:21,944
Then I'll research and plan
based on your requirements.

642
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:28,694
But what does your husband do?

643
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:30,944
He's a webtoon artist.

644
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,127
An artist?

645
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:34,527
He's very handsome.

646
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,061
That dick (Chibre-là).

647
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:39,827
Bastard (Shibal-nom)?

648
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:40,911
That's French.

649
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:43,227
It means handsome.

650
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,377
Oh, it is French for handsome?

651
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:50,261
The exhibition hall is this way.

652
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:06,844
Ms. Hae-in! Over here!

653
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:09,994
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, no.

654
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:12,427
Only 3 hours. You got here fast.

655
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:15,011
I was exercising so I didn't
realize so much time had passed.

656
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:16,844
Exercise is very important, of course.

657
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:17,845
I don't want to lose muscle mass.

658
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:23,861
It was too cold on the way here,

659
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,539
so I put on the jacket.

660
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:28,927
I hope you don't mind I wore it?

661
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:31,377
Why would I mind? You can keep it.

662
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:33,144
Thanks.

663
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:35,461
The restroom here...

664
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:37,011
It's down that way, at the end.

665
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:38,594
I'll be right back.

666
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:42,061
The passcode is 8585*.

667
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:49,861
Professor Cheon Deok-gyu?

668
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:53,011
What the hell? This damn...

669
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,677
I'm very happy to be
spending this time with you.

670
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:13,395
Sorry,

671
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:16,661
I drank a bit fast.

672
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:18,594
You're very cute.

673
00:39:19,162 --> 00:39:20,244
Okay.

674
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:30,662
Yes.

675
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,544
I mentioned it last time.

676
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,177
Necktie.

677
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,011
Right.

678
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:40,894
Come over for a bit.

679
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:44,928
Okay.

680
00:39:57,112 --> 00:39:58,112
Ms. Hae-in?

681
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:00,744
Mr. Cheol.

682
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,744
What are you doing here?

683
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:04,297
Do you come here often?

684
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:06,044
What about you?

685
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:08,377
I came for a drink alone after work.

686
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:09,594
I keep a bottle here.

687
00:40:10,295 --> 00:40:11,544
Want to have a drink together then?

688
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:12,877
Sure.

689
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:14,128
You don't mind, right?

690
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:15,628
No.

691
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:23,977
You're doing your master's, right?

692
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:25,095
Yes.

693
00:40:25,262 --> 00:40:26,727
I'm preparing for my PhD.

694
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:29,194
It must be hard, right?

695
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,861
You're a professor of public administration.

696
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:34,038
You must understand,

697
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:35,627
since you must have studied a lot. *

698
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:36,611
Yeah.

699
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:38,527
It is quite hard doing a PhD.

700
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:41,077
Doing a PhD is really hard.

701
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,261
I need to take this call.

702
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:51,344
Sure.

703
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,544
Go ahead.

704
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:00,927
When did you start keeping liquor here?

705
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:02,561
All you do is eat popcorn.

706
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,011
Then how did you end up here?

707
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:06,477
Also, professor?

708
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:09,061
Professor? What professor?

709
00:41:09,062 --> 00:41:11,227
That's hilarious!

710
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,444
You...

711
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:14,077
You tracked her location, didn't you?

712
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:16,944
Abusing your position for personal reasons?

713
00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:18,611
That's treason!

714
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,327
You should be put on trial immediately.

715
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,527
How is that treason?

716
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,911
I wanted to protect her from the killer.

717
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:26,244
That's disgusting.

718
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:27,444
So disgusting.

719
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:28,577
What did you say, brat?

720
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:30,661
Look at your age!

721
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:31,711
What about my age?

722
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,827
Looking so creepy.

723
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,311
Creepy.

724
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:39,327
You're almost 60.

725
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,711
Still such a lech.

726
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:42,511
You disrespectful punk!

727
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:44,061
You wanna eat shit?

728
00:41:44,095 --> 00:41:45,095
Oh, you're back.

729
00:41:47,645 --> 00:41:50,111
Oh wow, looking from here...

730
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:52,611
You two look so much alike.

731
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:53,928
Huh?

732
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:55,958
How do we look alike?

733
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:57,994
Rediscover your original purpose.

734
00:41:58,162 --> 00:41:59,277
I can do it.

735
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:01,627
I can do it.

736
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:08,261
Okay, forget the past.

737
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:10,661
Settle it using my old trade.

738
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,427
No story? Then rewrite it.

739
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:15,877
Things have come to this.

740
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:18,927
I need to make a new plan.

741
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:22,727
<i>If I were a villain,</i>

742
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:24,427
<i>what would I do?</i>

743
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:27,594
<i>Times have changed.</i>

744
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,977
<i>No villain follows the old ways anymore.</i>

745
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:31,977
<i>What's important is money.</i>

746
00:42:34,478 --> 00:42:36,661
<i>Information about a company's new products...</i>

747
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,994
<i>That must be very valuable information.</i>

748
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:41,561
<i>Targeting private companies is
better than targeting the government.</i>

749
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,444
<i>There won't be any repercussions.</i>

750
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:44,494
<i>Let's see...</i>

751
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:48,044
<i>The simplest method is armed intrusion.</i>

752
00:42:49,662 --> 00:42:50,911
<i>Limited firearms.</i>

753
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:51,911
<i>With this kind of firepower</i>

754
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:53,280
<i>it should be a piece of cake.</i>

755
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,820
<i>But...</i>

756
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:00,994
<i>But we'll definitely get cursed out for it.</i>

757
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,711
<i>First, evacuate everyone outside.</i>

758
00:43:02,712 --> 00:43:04,177
<i>Then mail a bomb,</i>

759
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:05,977
<i>set a timer, and blow it up.</i>

760
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:11,027
<i>That's too dangerous.</i>

761
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:12,354
<i>Let's find another way.</i>

762
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,811
<i>If a building like this catches fire</i>

763
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:23,561
<i>fire departments from this jurisdiction
and others will come to put it out.</i>

764
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:24,744
<i>In that case,</i>

765
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,411
<i>it'll be easy to disguise ourselves.</i>

766
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:45,144
<i>A firefighter could enter
through the evacuating crowd</i>

767
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:46,894
<i>without arousing suspicion.</i>

768
00:43:55,678 --> 00:43:57,294
<i>Once inside,</i>

769
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:01,194
<i>they also need to destroy the server.</i>

770
00:44:10,245 --> 00:44:11,594
<i>Jun will be a step behind.</i>

771
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:25,861
<i>The villains casually left the scene.</i>

772
00:44:26,962 --> 00:44:27,761
<i>The operation is over.</i>

773
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:28,844
This is it.

774
00:44:29,178 --> 00:44:31,677
This is the real Agent Jun.

775
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:32,711
Very good.

776
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,527
Looks like he's back to his roots.

777
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:36,727
Good.

778
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,433
But...

779
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:43,744
Just in case...

780
00:44:43,978 --> 00:44:48,444
This wasn't an operation you
were personally involved in, right?

781
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:50,694
It's not like I live like this every day.

782
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:52,844
I've run out of experiences to draw from.

783
00:44:52,845 --> 00:44:54,527
Really? I thought...

784
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:57,644
This chapter was really great.

785
00:44:57,645 --> 00:44:59,311
The characters felt so real.

786
00:44:59,312 --> 00:45:00,977
The response should be pretty good.

787
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:01,511
Really?

788
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:02,512
Yes.

789
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:05,077
Yeah. This is it.

790
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:19,644
Isn't it interesting?

791
00:45:21,295 --> 00:45:23,261
It looks quite convincing.

792
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:25,594
Right?

793
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:33,277
Do you know what artists pursue their whole lives?

794
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:34,527
What is it?

795
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:44,411
Turning imagination into reality.

796
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:56,611
<i>Best webtoon!</i>

797
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:57,727
<i>My life mentor is back!</i>

798
00:45:57,728 --> 00:45:58,044
<i>This is so good!</i>

799
00:45:58,045 --> 00:46:00,044
<i>Release the next chapter soon!</i>

800
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:02,011
<i>A classic never gets old.</i>

801
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:06,211
<i>Trash who like this trashy webtoon...</i>

802
00:46:06,212 --> 00:46:09,011
<i>must all be otaku pigs staying at home.</i>

803
00:46:09,012 --> 00:46:10,294
<i>Have you ever even earned 100 won?</i>

804
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,344
<i>Have you ever been on a date with a girl?</i>

805
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,927
<i>I'm so handsome, I make hundreds
of millions a year, and I drive a Ferrari</i>

806
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:15,677
<i>Cartoonist Kim, you bastard, I pity your parents.</i>

807
00:46:15,678 --> 00:46:16,727
<i>I'd love to see what they look like.</i>

808
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:18,844
<i>Did they actually celebrate
after giving birth to trash like you?</i>

809
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:19,677
<i>You unfilial bastard!</i>

810
00:46:19,678 --> 00:46:21,027
<i>If you have no talent, go learn a trade.</i>

811
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,077
<i>Stop padding chapters just to farm clicks.</i>

812
00:46:23,078 --> 00:46:23,959
This bastard!

813
00:46:23,983 --> 00:46:25,311
How dare you insult my deceased parents?

814
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:26,627
You don't bring family into this!

815
00:46:26,978 --> 00:46:28,811
I swear I'll find him.

816
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:30,744
That lunatic. I'm going to kill him!

817
00:46:30,878 --> 00:46:31,878
VeryHandsome?

818
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:39,277
You're dead meat!

819
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:40,427
Just you wait!

820
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,111
Kid.

821
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,594
I've come to kill you.

822
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:11,377
So you're the VeryHandsome?

823
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:16,170
Kim Soo-hyuk, the webtoon artist?

824
00:47:20,595 --> 00:47:24,644
Nobody cares about me.

825
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:28,061
Let alone a girlfriend,

826
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,061
I don't even have a decent friend.

827
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:31,311
What about your parents?

828
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:32,644
They're both busy with work.

829
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:34,311
They don't come back until after midnight

830
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,327
and don't care about me either.

831
00:47:41,045 --> 00:47:43,911
The only time I get attention

832
00:47:44,045 --> 00:47:46,211
is when someone gives me a like.

833
00:47:47,295 --> 00:47:48,295
So...

834
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:49,744
even if that's the case,

835
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:51,711
you shouldn't hide online
writing malicious comments.

836
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:53,844
Insulting people's parents...

837
00:47:54,295 --> 00:47:55,644
that's not what a decent person does.

838
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,094
I'm sorry.

839
00:47:58,262 --> 00:48:00,027
I'm really sorry.

840
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:04,811
But, Mr. Cartoonist...

841
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:06,145
What?

842
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,411
You're trespassing, right?

843
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:11,994
Before my parents get back,

844
00:48:12,562 --> 00:48:14,344
you should leave quickly.

845
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,004
Alright then.

846
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:20,028
Mm.

847
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:21,495
I'll leave now.

848
00:48:21,795 --> 00:48:22,877
Not that way.

849
00:48:24,912 --> 00:48:26,711
Leave through the front door.

850
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:28,271
Can I?

851
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:29,054
Mm-hmm.

852
00:48:29,078 --> 00:48:30,078
Thanks.

853
00:48:31,462 --> 00:48:32,462
Wait a moment.

854
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:38,644
Eat this on the way back.

855
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:40,221
Thanks.

856
00:48:40,728 --> 00:48:43,927
I've been a fan of Agent Jun
since elementary school.

857
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:46,694
This episode is really interesting too.

858
00:48:47,312 --> 00:48:48,477
Really.

859
00:48:50,145 --> 00:48:50,811
You punk.

860
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:52,561
Don't just stay cooped up inside typing all day.

861
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,894
You talk a good game.

862
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:54,861
Talk more with your friends.

863
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:55,754
Be more outgoing.

864
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:56,277
Okay.

865
00:48:56,278 --> 00:48:58,077
And if you lost some weight,

866
00:48:59,195 --> 00:48:59,894
you'd be handsome too.

867
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,621
What?

868
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:01,827
Never mind. I'm leaving.

869
00:49:02,195 --> 00:49:03,195
Okay.

870
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:10,261
Arrived at the target location.

871
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:13,044
Get ready...

872
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:17,261
Download complete.

873
00:50:42,528 --> 00:50:45,777
The fire at Neuron Science wasn't an accident

874
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:48,627
but a planned criminal explosion.

875
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,994
This is shocking news.

876
00:50:49,995 --> 00:50:51,677
According to the police report,

877
00:50:51,678 --> 00:50:53,911
their target was the latest AI technology.

878
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:56,761
The methods of corporate
espionage are evolving rapidly.

879
00:50:56,878 --> 00:51:00,427
It's even more shocking that a crime resembling

880
00:51:00,462 --> 00:51:02,511
a terrorist attack has occurred domestically.

881
00:51:02,628 --> 00:51:03,427
Cartoonist Kim...

882
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:06,294
Is he innocent, or is he a terrorist?

883
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:09,727
The webtoon's content is strikingly
similar to the terrorist attack.

884
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:10,861
Cartoonist Kim...

885
00:51:12,145 --> 00:51:14,494
This is incredible!

886
00:51:15,062 --> 00:51:16,644
Ga-yeong! Something terrible happened!

887
00:51:16,645 --> 00:51:17,111
Huh?

888
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:17,611
What?

889
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:22,527
I think that Cartoonist Kim is the culprit.

890
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:25,794
He's desperate for attention.

891
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:29,504
Jun couldn't have planned this, right?

892
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,877
No matter how crazy he is,

893
00:51:32,962 --> 00:51:34,294
he wouldn't be this crazy.

894
00:51:34,295 --> 00:51:36,794
How could this happen?

895
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:38,377
You scared me!

896
00:51:38,378 --> 00:51:39,310
Jun, Jun, Jun!

897
00:51:39,334 --> 00:51:40,177
It's the damn Jun again!

898
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:42,344
Damn Jun!

899
00:51:43,545 --> 00:51:45,044
Issue a level-one wanted notice immediately!

900
00:51:45,045 --> 00:51:46,677
Bring that guy back right now!

901
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:47,977
Calm down. Sit and talk.

902
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:49,727
How can I calm down? Just bring him back!

903
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:50,977
Sit down, sit down.

904
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:53,777
Calm down.

905
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:54,895
Get your hands off!

906
00:51:58,395 --> 00:51:59,994
Don't be soft-hearted.

907
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:02,944
The biggest beneficiary this time is Jun.

908
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,661
This guy's webtoon views are skyrocketing.

909
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:07,294
What does this mean?

910
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:08,827
But...

911
00:52:08,828 --> 00:52:09,994
This guy previously revealed

912
00:52:10,078 --> 00:52:12,761
state secrets in his webtoon.

913
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:14,961
Now that there are no secrets left to reveal,

914
00:52:14,962 --> 00:52:16,211
he's teamed up with terrorists

915
00:52:16,212 --> 00:52:18,744
to create new stories!

916
00:52:18,745 --> 00:52:21,211
Bring that guy back.

917
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:22,212
Bring him back!

918
00:52:22,295 --> 00:52:23,461
Get up, you!

919
00:52:23,462 --> 00:52:24,177
Get up!

920
00:52:24,178 --> 00:52:24,677
What's wrong?

921
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:25,377
Wake up!

922
00:52:25,378 --> 00:52:26,561
What is it now?

923
00:52:27,262 --> 00:52:28,527
I want to ask

924
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,677
what's going on here.

925
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:31,561
I don't understand what you're saying.

926
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:33,177
- Seriously...
- Dad, your webtoon.

927
00:52:33,178 --> 00:52:34,061
Webtoon...

928
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:35,744
- Show him.
- This episode is great, right?

929
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,977
How can things go on like this?

930
00:52:38,978 --> 00:52:40,611
With something like this happening,
how can we be happy?

931
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:41,861
Isn't going viral a good thing?

932
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:42,894
- Honestly, you...

933
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:43,977
What nonsense are you talking about?

934
00:52:43,978 --> 00:52:44,978
Quick, look.

935
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:47,077
What's going on? Look.

936
00:52:47,078 --> 00:52:49,411
After today's webtoon update,

937
00:52:49,412 --> 00:52:51,027
three hours later,

938
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:52,661
an identical crime occurred.

939
00:52:52,662 --> 00:52:55,044
This is outrageous!

940
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:56,045
What happened?

941
00:52:56,378 --> 00:52:57,294
Something's wrong, isn't it?

942
00:52:57,295 --> 00:52:58,577
You drew this?

943
00:52:58,578 --> 00:52:59,927
First...

944
00:53:00,212 --> 00:53:02,294
Ga-yeong, step outside for a moment.

945
00:53:02,295 --> 00:53:04,761
He predicted this crime would happen.

946
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:06,021
You didn't draw this drunk, did you?

947
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:08,877
It can't be such a coincidence.

948
00:53:08,945 --> 00:53:12,844
Why always pick on my kind husband?

949
00:53:12,845 --> 00:53:14,327
After the webtoon got popular,

950
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,244
we could finally live a bit happier.

951
00:53:16,245 --> 00:53:18,794
Why would he do something like this?

952
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:19,427
Living happily?

953
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:20,211
Yes.

954
00:53:20,212 --> 00:53:22,727
Do you know your husband's
current financial situation?

955
00:53:22,728 --> 00:53:24,061
My husband...

956
00:53:24,062 --> 00:53:26,161
After Agent Jun got popular,

957
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,227
even though there's still a bank loan,

958
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:28,361
we bought a house. We're living happily.

959
00:53:28,362 --> 00:53:29,661
Your husband...

960
00:53:30,412 --> 00:53:31,744
He used the house as collateral to buy stocks.

961
00:53:31,745 --> 00:53:33,327
What does that have to do with this?

962
00:53:33,328 --> 00:53:34,294
How is it not related?

963
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,577
What was stolen from that
company was the AI technology.

964
00:53:36,578 --> 00:53:38,377
You wanted to sell it to make big money, right?

965
00:53:38,545 --> 00:53:40,794
No, what did you just say?

966
00:53:41,578 --> 00:53:42,644
You want to make big money, right?

967
00:53:42,645 --> 00:53:43,861
No, the sentence before that.

968
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:45,277
"Used the house as collateral to buy stocks."

969
00:53:45,278 --> 00:53:46,282
You bastard!

970
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,744
Do you want me to get divorced?

971
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:49,127
Let go! Let go!

972
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:51,511
Wait, stop.

973
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:52,591
Wait a minute.

974
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:55,193
You...

975
00:53:55,912 --> 00:53:57,528
Speak clearly.

976
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:58,928
What did you just say?

977
00:54:01,695 --> 00:54:03,044
Your husband

978
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:05,111
used the house you live in now as collateral.

979
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:07,428
He bought stocks and cryptocurrency,

980
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:09,411
and lost everything.

981
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,428
That guy...

982
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:12,461
They also, because of your husband...

983
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:13,561
lost everything.

984
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:15,261
And he calls himself a senior?

985
00:54:15,262 --> 00:54:15,894
Bastard!

986
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:16,895
Really?

987
00:54:16,979 --> 00:54:17,711
Lost everything?

988
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,394
No, no.

989
00:54:18,395 --> 00:54:19,444
How much did you lose?

990
00:54:19,479 --> 00:54:20,611
Well...

991
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:23,311
60-70%

992
00:54:23,312 --> 00:54:24,328
Tell the truth!

993
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:25,994
Don't be honest.

994
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:26,995
90%!

995
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:31,444
You lunatic!

996
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:35,294
Life was just starting to
get better and you pull this!

997
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:37,594
Do you want to die?

998
00:54:37,618 --> 00:54:38,838
You liar!

999
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:41,878
How could you do this?

1000
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:45,938
Is it funny?

1001
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:46,628
Very funny?

1002
00:54:46,629 --> 00:54:47,911
What's so funny?

1003
00:54:47,912 --> 00:54:49,594
Hid the past.

1004
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:52,178
You also hid many things from him.

1005
00:54:52,345 --> 00:54:53,728
What are you talking about?

1006
00:54:53,729 --> 00:54:54,928
Ms. Mi-na! Ms. Lee Mi-na!

1007
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:55,594
What?

1008
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:57,378
Your past is really quite something.

1009
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:58,994
What's so special about it?

1010
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,561
Play the video.

1011
00:55:01,145 --> 00:55:02,361
Ms. Lee Mi-na.

1012
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,944
Original name, Lee Soon-geum.

1013
00:55:06,062 --> 00:55:07,311
While at Seoul University,

1014
00:55:07,312 --> 00:55:09,644
she was always a cover model.

1015
00:55:09,645 --> 00:55:11,411
Her nickname was '60 Seconds'.

1016
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:14,861
She could charm anyone within 60 seconds.

1017
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:18,961
She became a legend in the famous

1018
00:55:19,245 --> 00:55:20,528
nightclubs of Hongdae.

1019
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:21,878
'60 Seconds'...

1020
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,036
Sister-in-law, that tattoo on your arm...

1021
00:55:26,629 --> 00:55:27,574
Who is this guy?

1022
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,628
Just someone I know.

1023
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:32,173
Where did you find these photos?

1024
00:55:32,277 --> 00:55:33,250
Psyworld.

1025
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,050
Haduri.

1026
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,130
Damoim.

1027
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:36,269
C Club.

1028
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:37,196
I Love School.

1029
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:39,861
I deleted everything completely.

1030
00:55:39,862 --> 00:55:40,978
How did you find it?

1031
00:55:40,979 --> 00:55:42,561
We're the NIS.
(National Intelligence Service)

1032
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:46,361
Mi-na, who are you really?

1033
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:48,444
You seem like a stranger I don't recognize.

1034
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:49,911
Seriously?

1035
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:52,424
So I had a past.

1036
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:53,244
So what?

1037
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:54,828
So, do you want to

1038
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:55,878
"return" me now?

1039
00:55:55,879 --> 00:55:56,311
No.

1040
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:57,344
Seriously.

1041
00:55:58,379 --> 00:55:59,177
But still...

1042
00:55:59,178 --> 00:56:01,094
This is an invasion of personal privacy, right?

1043
00:56:01,095 --> 00:56:01,794
Yes.

1044
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:02,594
Right?

1045
00:56:02,595 --> 00:56:06,128
Can you just investigate
an ordinary person's past?

1046
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,677
What exactly are you trying to do?

1047
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:09,177
Invading my personal privacy...

1048
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:12,194
Why show photos of me from 20 years ago?

1049
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:12,978
What did you say?

1050
00:56:12,979 --> 00:56:15,811
You bastard! You ruined my family!

1051
00:56:15,812 --> 00:56:17,294
Bastard?

1052
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:18,044
Get over here!

1053
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,394
Let go! Let go!

1054
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:20,477
Get her out of here.

1055
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,011
Stop making a scene!

1056
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,644
I know! This is so embarrassing.

1057
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:26,523
You!

1058
00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:28,394
I'll deal with you later.

1059
00:56:30,362 --> 00:56:31,444
What are you looking at?

1060
00:56:32,062 --> 00:56:33,861
You look like a python.

1061
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:35,238
What? Python?

1062
00:56:35,262 --> 00:56:36,444
What?

1063
00:56:36,944 --> 00:56:38,800
Seriously.

1064
00:56:39,912 --> 00:56:42,628
- I won't go out then.
- Take care, sister-in-law.

1065
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:47,344
I'm screwed.

1066
00:56:48,462 --> 00:56:50,044
I'm screwed.

1067
00:56:50,045 --> 00:56:51,544
Seriously.

1068
00:56:51,795 --> 00:56:53,628
What are you guys even good for?

1069
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:55,411
Even the NIS

1070
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,144
shouldn't mess with people's families, right?

1071
00:56:57,145 --> 00:56:58,511
Do you wanna die, punk?

1072
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:00,177
Shoot! Shoot!

1073
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:00,961
Hurry up and shoot!

1074
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:01,844
You think I won't?

1075
00:57:01,845 --> 00:57:03,677
- Shoot!
- You think I don't dare?

1076
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:05,944
Let go of me! You wanna die?

1077
00:57:06,512 --> 00:57:08,444
Please calm down.

1078
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:10,144
That's not the point.

1079
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:10,728
Let go!

1080
00:57:10,729 --> 00:57:11,811
What about that case?

1081
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:13,028
Were you really involved?

1082
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,278
I'm going crazy!

1083
00:57:14,279 --> 00:57:15,944
Why would I do something like that?

1084
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:16,778
Do you have proof?

1085
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:17,444
What?

1086
00:57:17,445 --> 00:57:19,194
Do you have proof you didn't do it?

1087
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:21,444
I didn't do it, so how could there be proof?

1088
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:22,544
An alibi.

1089
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:23,505
An alibi?

1090
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:25,828
When the incident occurred
where were you and what were you doing?

1091
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:27,044
That day...

1092
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,761
Look at this guy.

1093
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:32,844
He's got a guilty conscience,
that's why he won't talk!

1094
00:57:34,995 --> 00:57:37,011
So, that day,

1095
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,511
were you two together?

1096
00:57:39,629 --> 00:57:40,629
Why?

1097
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:44,261
Because I wrote a nasty comment online.

1098
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:46,594
He came to kill me

1099
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:47,819
because he was angry.

1100
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:48,677
I admit I went a bit too far.

1101
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:49,678
So,

1102
00:57:50,395 --> 00:57:52,144
did this uncle really want to kill you?

1103
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:53,328
No...

1104
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,144
If he really did would I still be here?

1105
00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:56,005
You punk.

1106
00:57:56,029 --> 00:57:58,094
Lying here will have serious consequences.

1107
00:57:58,629 --> 00:57:59,678
What exactly did he do?

1108
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:00,795
He...

1109
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:04,561
Gave me life guidance.

1110
00:58:04,629 --> 00:58:05,629
What?

1111
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:06,427
Do you have evidence?

1112
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:07,761
This is outrageous.

1113
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:09,561
- That's enough!
- I have...

1114
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:10,488
What?

1115
00:58:10,512 --> 00:58:11,238
I have.

1116
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:12,262
What?

1117
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:13,478
- What?
- Do you have it?

1118
00:58:13,479 --> 00:58:14,261
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

1119
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:15,978
- What is it? Where?
- Why?

1120
00:58:15,979 --> 00:58:16,427
What is it?

1121
00:58:16,428 --> 00:58:17,978
- You brat!
- I have...

1122
00:58:17,979 --> 00:58:20,478
- So where is it? What evidence?
- What is it?

1123
00:58:20,479 --> 00:58:23,161
2024/06/05 22:14:30:01

1124
00:58:24,779 --> 00:58:26,044
When did you record this?

1125
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:28,378
Just in case.

1126
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:30,628
It's a treacherous world.

1127
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:35,544
I really don't know whether to praise you or not.

1128
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:40,211
How many times do I have to say it wasn't me?

1129
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:42,011
Is that enough?

1130
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:44,829
Take him away.

1131
00:58:50,762 --> 00:58:51,762
Wait.

1132
00:58:53,678 --> 00:58:54,678
So, he really is

1133
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:56,694
Agent Jun...

1134
00:58:57,762 --> 00:58:58,977
It's a state secret.

1135
00:59:01,029 --> 00:59:02,029
Okay.

1136
00:59:05,612 --> 00:59:06,612
See you next time.

1137
00:59:07,145 --> 00:59:08,145
Okay.

1138
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:16,011
Is there really no one you suspect?

1139
00:59:19,562 --> 00:59:20,994
There's something...

1140
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:25,161
I didn't want to tell you.

1141
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:32,078
Chief, where are we going now?

1142
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:34,178
You'll know when we get there.

1143
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:35,271
Where are we going?

1144
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,428
You'll know when we get there.

1145
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:46,427
Why are these people here?

1146
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:48,677
A lot of people hold grudges against you.

1147
00:59:48,678 --> 00:59:50,644
Are all these people here to kill me?

1148
00:59:50,645 --> 00:59:51,645
That's right.

1149
00:59:51,928 --> 00:59:53,421
You should've told me earlier!

1150
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:55,228
You're living a new life now.

1151
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:57,644
We didn't want you to keep dwelling on the past.

1152
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:59,194
Yeah.

1153
00:59:59,312 --> 01:00:01,144
You're not Agent Jun anymore.

1154
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:02,528
You're the cartoonist Kim Soo-hyuk,

1155
01:00:02,729 --> 01:00:03,944
a family man.

1156
01:00:03,945 --> 01:00:04,945
Yeah.

1157
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:06,145
Chief.

1158
01:00:06,862 --> 01:00:07,862
Cheol.

1159
01:00:25,178 --> 01:00:27,477
I just can't figure it out.

1160
01:00:28,178 --> 01:00:29,511
Who could it be?

1161
01:00:29,678 --> 01:00:31,278
I have a feeling this person is tough.

1162
01:00:34,395 --> 01:00:35,395
Basically...

1163
01:00:35,428 --> 01:00:36,977
There's only one thing we know.

1164
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:38,038
What's that?

1165
01:00:38,062 --> 01:00:39,194
That person

1166
01:00:39,529 --> 01:00:40,561
imitates the events in my webtoon.

1167
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:41,621
So?

1168
01:00:41,645 --> 01:00:43,228
To catch a fish, you need bait.

1169
01:00:43,229 --> 01:00:44,229
Bait?

1170
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:45,895
Chief.

1171
01:00:46,562 --> 01:00:48,028
I'll draw the next chapter and see.

1172
01:00:51,395 --> 01:00:53,044
Reporting on the special operation.

1173
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:55,861
Based on the premise that the
opponent will mimic Jun's webtoon

1174
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:58,578
we can choose a controllable time and place,

1175
01:00:58,579 --> 01:00:59,744
lie in wait beforehand

1176
01:00:59,745 --> 01:01:01,044
and when the opponent appears,

1177
01:01:01,045 --> 01:01:03,711
striking first is our operational plan this time.

1178
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,397
What are you doing?

1179
01:01:07,421 --> 01:01:08,311
Hurry up and start!

1180
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:09,910
Let me see...

1181
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:11,227
Where should the target building be?

1182
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:13,427
Is there a building we can use in our decoy plan?

1183
01:01:13,428 --> 01:01:15,677
I've already selected a
few inconspicuous locations.

1184
01:01:15,678 --> 01:01:17,528
Wouldn't that be even more suspicious?

1185
01:01:17,812 --> 01:01:20,261
If I choose a specific building
as the target in my webtoon

1186
01:01:20,262 --> 01:01:21,594
the opponent will be even more suspicious.

1187
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:22,811
Let's just pick a regular company building.

1188
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:23,911
Fewer civilians involved.

1189
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:28,194
So I think...

1190
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:29,911
how about a bank?

1191
01:01:30,112 --> 01:01:31,112
A bank?

1192
01:01:31,245 --> 01:01:32,578
A bank...

1193
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:34,611
Isn't it straightforward?

1194
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:37,378
Robbing a bank to steal money.

1195
01:01:43,995 --> 01:01:46,644
<i>How quickly to scout the target bank and rob it...</i>

1196
01:01:47,545 --> 01:01:49,061
Nobody move!

1197
01:01:59,312 --> 01:02:00,394
Go, go, go!

1198
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:03,262
Damn it.

1199
01:02:03,645 --> 01:02:05,244
Robbing a bank is a race against time.

1200
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:07,994
The enemy might mobilize everyone.

1201
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:10,911
It's the best way to catch them all at once.

1202
01:02:10,945 --> 01:02:12,794
If it were me, I'd create a diversion first

1203
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:14,544
to buy time.

1204
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:16,411
<i>Get all police responding to the bank</i>

1205
01:02:16,412 --> 01:02:17,961
<i>to gather elsewhere.</i>

1206
01:02:21,062 --> 01:02:22,928
<i>Then seize the opportunity</i>

1207
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:24,610
<i>to rob the bank.</i>

1208
01:02:24,962 --> 01:02:26,511
Nobody move!

1209
01:02:32,129 --> 01:02:35,178
The car's blocked in. We can't get out.

1210
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:41,944
Damn it.

1211
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,528
We need to prevent civilian casualties.

1212
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:47,194
Then let's pick a warehouse we bought

1213
01:02:47,195 --> 01:02:48,861
one far from residential areas.

1214
01:02:48,862 --> 01:02:50,311
There's one warehouse that
hasn't been demolished yet.

1215
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:51,611
Okay, I'll check

1216
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:53,744
if there's a bank within
a 3km radius that can help.

1217
01:02:53,862 --> 01:02:55,461
Okay,
I'll change the building type to 'warehouse'.

1218
01:03:04,972 --> 01:03:06,020
Explosion set.

1219
01:03:06,044 --> 01:03:07,987
Lots of cops showed up.

1220
01:03:11,345 --> 01:03:12,511
Nobody move!

1221
01:03:13,178 --> 01:03:15,344
Hands on your head!

1222
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,229
Freeze!

1223
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:21,194
Now's the time to make your entrance,

1224
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:22,611
Jun.

1225
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:36,644
- Who is it?
- Kill him!

1226
01:03:45,379 --> 01:03:47,044
Wait!

1227
01:03:52,712 --> 01:03:53,807
Hey!

1228
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:55,778
If you do that, the money will be blown up!

1229
01:03:55,779 --> 01:03:59,411
What will be blown up isn't the money,
but these people's hearts.

1230
01:04:00,862 --> 01:04:01,994
That was awesome.

1231
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:05,711
Cartoonist Kim.

1232
01:04:05,712 --> 01:04:09,228
What happened, has nothing to do with you, right?

1233
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:10,578
It really doesn't.

1234
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:12,694
If the NIS

1235
01:04:13,479 --> 01:04:14,478
contacts you, please let me know.

1236
01:04:14,479 --> 01:04:15,784
Okay, got it.

1237
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:17,244
Be careful.

1238
01:04:18,762 --> 01:04:19,762
Mm.

1239
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,079
It's been a while.

1240
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:23,244
Are we carrying out a mission together again?

1241
01:04:23,629 --> 01:04:24,744
Reminds me of the old days.

1242
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:28,078
You wet-behind-the-ears punk, what 'old days'?

1243
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,211
I was just saying.

1244
01:04:33,428 --> 01:04:34,394
Good work.

1245
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:35,761
This is all for the country.

1246
01:04:35,762 --> 01:04:37,094
Your mission is complete.

1247
01:04:37,178 --> 01:04:38,178
What?

1248
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:40,228
Until this operation is over,

1249
01:04:40,229 --> 01:04:41,727
stay here.

1250
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:43,227
But Deputy Director.

1251
01:04:43,288 --> 01:04:46,305
Jun is the key person in this operation.

1252
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:47,811
He's a webtoon artist.

1253
01:04:48,729 --> 01:04:49,605
And a civilian.

1254
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:51,194
- Deputy Director
- Damn it.

1255
01:04:51,895 --> 01:04:52,588
Jun.

1256
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:54,194
I know what you're capable of.

1257
01:04:54,612 --> 01:04:56,278
But you have no authority to act officially.

1258
01:04:56,279 --> 01:04:57,394
Don't you think your involvement

1259
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:59,028
will only make things worse?

1260
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:00,029
That's right.

1261
01:05:00,445 --> 01:05:01,544
This is for your own good.

1262
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,128
And for your family.

1263
01:05:07,162 --> 01:05:08,036
Yeah, Jun.

1264
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,060
Don't worry about it.

1265
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:09,994
We've got this.

1266
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:11,302
Yeah.

1267
01:05:11,326 --> 01:05:12,371
We'll handle it properly this time.

1268
01:05:12,395 --> 01:05:12,944
Okay.

1269
01:05:12,945 --> 01:05:13,888
You guys stay out of it too.

1270
01:05:13,912 --> 01:05:14,912
What?

1271
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:16,961
Don't go to the scene causing trouble.

1272
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,161
Stay in the office and work.

1273
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:19,445
Deputy Director.

1274
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:20,928
How can you say that?

1275
01:05:22,012 --> 01:05:23,977
Accidents must be prevented before they happen.

1276
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:28,394
You guys are just a bunch of troublemakers.

1277
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:30,528
Don't stick together.

1278
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:36,828
I told you not to gather together.

1279
01:05:39,695 --> 01:05:41,994
They're very interested in this operation.

1280
01:05:42,445 --> 01:05:44,578
It's a good chance to earn credit.

1281
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:46,195
What?

1282
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:52,711
Shield Team people are an
eyesore even when they do nothing.

1283
01:05:55,462 --> 01:05:57,094
The credit for this operation

1284
01:05:57,178 --> 01:05:58,778
is all mine.

1285
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:03,278
It belongs to us.

1286
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,228
Until the operation ends,

1287
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,229
just stay here.

1288
01:06:08,562 --> 01:06:09,894
Is this necessary?

1289
01:06:10,312 --> 01:06:11,694
I'm a civilian.

1290
01:06:12,562 --> 01:06:14,411
I just do as I'm told.

1291
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:16,628
Where do we eat?

1292
01:06:16,629 --> 01:06:18,261
There's no mess hall here.

1293
01:06:19,129 --> 01:06:20,261
If you're in a hurry, eat some noodles.

1294
01:06:20,262 --> 01:06:21,944
I won't eat noodles!

1295
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,394
Order me some jajangmyeon.

1296
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:27,404
Help me wrap things up over there, got it?

1297
01:06:27,428 --> 01:06:28,428
- Got it.
- Thanks.

1298
01:06:35,562 --> 01:06:36,562
Okay.

1299
01:06:36,695 --> 01:06:38,361
I might not be home for a few days.

1300
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:39,578
What the hell are you talking about?

1301
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,044
It's not nonsense.

1302
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:43,378
The NIS really needs me.

1303
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:44,544
Are you still involved with them?

1304
01:06:44,779 --> 01:06:45,911
Will you snap out of it?!

1305
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:47,378
Why are you getting involved in that?

1306
01:06:47,495 --> 01:06:49,261
Didn't we agree you wouldn't
do that kind of thing anymore?

1307
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:50,795
Sorry.

1308
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:53,677
I won't go to the field.

1309
01:06:53,678 --> 01:06:54,961
You don't need to worry.

1310
01:06:54,962 --> 01:06:56,511
Don't try to be some hero.

1311
01:06:56,678 --> 01:06:57,977
You're a father.

1312
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:00,144
Don't just think about yourself.

1313
01:07:00,205 --> 01:07:01,538
Of course.

1314
01:07:01,562 --> 01:07:02,961
I'm a father. I have to take care of myself.

1315
01:07:02,962 --> 01:07:03,821
Forget it.

1316
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:04,861
You're getting paid for this, aren't you?

1317
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:07,011
This is for the country.

1318
01:07:07,012 --> 01:07:09,278
You lost so much money in stocks
and you still dare say that?

1319
01:07:09,428 --> 01:07:10,727
How are you going to cover this financial hole?

1320
01:07:10,862 --> 01:07:11,361
I'm asking you.

1321
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:13,161
Your webtoon is finished too, you brat!

1322
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:14,445
Sorry.

1323
01:07:14,522 --> 01:07:16,937
I'll talk to Chief.

1324
01:07:17,395 --> 01:07:18,644
Ask him to settle my labor costs.

1325
01:07:18,645 --> 01:07:20,078
Make sure you tell him.

1326
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:22,938
Tell him I'll sue him if he doesn't. Got it?

1327
01:07:22,962 --> 01:07:24,427
Okay, I'll tell him you'll sue if he doesn't pay.

1328
01:07:24,428 --> 01:07:25,428
Make sure you do.

1329
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:27,912
Damn it!

1330
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,844
Come on, you scared me.

1331
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:37,045
Hello.

1332
01:07:37,212 --> 01:07:38,212
Let's proceed.

1333
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:40,894
Okay, got it.

1334
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:54,994
Ga-yeong, the webtoon's been updated.

1335
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:00,744
Look, the webtoon's been updated again.

1336
01:08:00,745 --> 01:08:04,211
Will the webtoon become reality this time?

1337
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:29,744
The fate of the National Intelligence
Agency rests on this operation.

1338
01:08:29,745 --> 01:08:31,328
All personnel, deploy to the scene.

1339
01:08:31,329 --> 01:08:32,329
Yes, sir!

1340
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:40,412
New intel.

1341
01:08:49,428 --> 01:08:50,021
New message!

1342
01:08:55,145 --> 01:08:56,361
See you soon.

1343
01:08:58,012 --> 01:09:01,278
Chief, I'm heading off now.

1344
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:03,229
Alright.

1345
01:09:03,362 --> 01:09:05,111
I'll go with you...

1346
01:09:05,912 --> 01:09:06,928
That brat!

1347
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:20,529
Huh?

1348
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:21,921
Hey.

1349
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,294
Huh?

1350
01:09:23,862 --> 01:09:25,261
Why are you here?

1351
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,578
What are you doing here? Are you lost?

1352
01:09:28,579 --> 01:09:29,578
Of course,

1353
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:31,661
I came because our Ms. Hae-in invited me.

1354
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:33,078
Our Ms. Hae-in?

1355
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:33,805
Yeah.

1356
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:35,461
How disgusting.

1357
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:37,211
Watch your behavior. Act your age.

1358
01:09:37,212 --> 01:09:40,011
I should be asking you that. An ignorant
brat like you doing in an exhibition hall?

1359
01:09:40,495 --> 01:09:42,211
You really like exhibitions, huh?

1360
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:43,844
Why don't you go back to eating pancakes?

1361
01:09:44,129 --> 01:09:46,228
Look who's talking.

1362
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:50,261
Your hair looks so elaborate.

1363
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:51,053
How is it?

1364
01:09:51,744 --> 01:09:52,478
Do I look good?

1365
01:09:52,645 --> 01:09:53,645
Look.

1366
01:09:54,095 --> 01:09:54,728
Here.

1367
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,361
Mm-hmm, it's a bit separated.

1368
01:09:57,028 --> 01:09:57,655
Fix it up.

1369
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,228
Fix it up...

1370
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,144
- It hasn't fallen, right?
- Just adjust it a bit.

1371
01:10:01,145 --> 01:10:02,444
Ms. Hae-in.

1372
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:05,411
Congratulations.

1373
01:10:05,803 --> 01:10:06,586
You're here.

1374
01:10:06,611 --> 01:10:07,926
Here, this is for you.

1375
01:10:11,528 --> 01:10:14,161
You two are really amusing.

1376
01:10:14,662 --> 01:10:15,844
What's with that tone?

1377
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:17,421
Ah, okay.

1378
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:18,445
Chief Cheon.

1379
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:20,795
Agent Cheol.

1380
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:24,928
Long time no see.

1381
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,444
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1382
01:10:34,345 --> 01:10:35,345
What?

1383
01:10:36,895 --> 01:10:37,895
Damn it!

1384
01:10:39,229 --> 01:10:40,994
Two, four, six, eight... Why are there so many?

1385
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,578
But you were definitely dead!

1386
01:10:43,579 --> 01:10:45,827
If they could fake Jun's death,

1387
01:10:46,362 --> 01:10:47,578
why couldn't I?

1388
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:48,711
It's you.

1389
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:50,829
It's you again.

1390
01:10:50,862 --> 01:10:52,827
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

1391
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:55,911
Long time no see. Let's catch up.

1392
01:10:55,912 --> 01:10:56,912
No!

1393
01:10:57,412 --> 01:10:58,355
Let the woman leave.

1394
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,379
Hae...

1395
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:02,078
- It's dangerous! Give that to me!
- You did well.

1396
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:03,461
- Come on, give it to me.
- Give the gun back now.

1397
01:11:03,462 --> 01:11:05,461
- Ms. Hae-in, you can't hold that!
- Ms. Hae-in!

1398
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:06,928
Holding a gun doesn't suit you.

1399
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,878
Ms. Hae-in!

1400
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:11,011
- What are you doing?
- Oh my god!

1401
01:11:11,012 --> 01:11:13,044
- Ms. Hae-in!
- What are you doing?

1402
01:11:13,045 --> 01:11:14,878
- Ms. Hae-in!
- What are you doing?

1403
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:16,394
Don't you like me?

1404
01:11:16,562 --> 01:11:18,728
- Ms. Hae-in!
- This isn't right!

1405
01:11:18,812 --> 01:11:21,811
Ms. Hae-in!

1406
01:11:21,812 --> 01:11:22,694
- Ms. Hae-in!
- No!

1407
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,194
- Ms. Hae-in!
- No!

1408
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:27,195
No!

1409
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,711
This operation...

1410
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:42,961
I will carry it out personally.

1411
01:11:48,462 --> 01:11:49,728
What do you want?

1412
01:11:51,429 --> 01:11:52,429
Is it revenge?

1413
01:11:53,095 --> 01:11:54,311
That's all in the past.

1414
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:57,094
Jun is finally living like a human now.

1415
01:11:58,429 --> 01:12:00,311
It's been so long.
Do you really have to go this far?

1416
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:03,161
I'm here to take back what you stole.

1417
01:12:03,429 --> 01:12:04,429
Don't tell me it's...

1418
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:07,779
Hellgate?

1419
01:12:08,812 --> 01:12:10,528
Hellgate? What's that?

1420
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,661
Are you doing all this because of Hellgate?

1421
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,578
You'll pay the price too.

1422
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:17,044
Wait. What price?

1423
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:19,411
And what is Hellgate?

1424
01:12:19,662 --> 01:12:21,661
Chief, what are you talking about?

1425
01:12:21,662 --> 01:12:24,128
If you hadn't stolen Hellgate,

1426
01:12:25,312 --> 01:12:27,294
my family wouldn't have died.

1427
01:12:28,212 --> 01:12:29,894
I regret what happened.

1428
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,728
But it couldn't be avoided.

1429
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:39,561
What did you say?

1430
01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:44,812
Stop it!

1431
01:12:48,145 --> 01:12:50,778
I didn't expect things to
suddenly turn out that way either.

1432
01:12:52,312 --> 01:12:55,628
People like us just do what
the country tells us to.

1433
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:04,178
All dogs of the motherland.

1434
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:08,594
Where did you hide Hellgate?

1435
01:13:10,129 --> 01:13:11,428
I don't know.

1436
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,178
We were just busy escaping.

1437
01:13:14,879 --> 01:13:17,278
South's demon, Cheon Deok-gyu.

1438
01:13:18,512 --> 01:13:20,194
South's best agent.

1439
01:13:20,812 --> 01:13:23,194
He's comparable to me,

1440
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:26,728
the North Korean Grim Reaper.

1441
01:13:27,312 --> 01:13:30,078
It's hard to make him talk.

1442
01:13:34,195 --> 01:13:35,195
Wait.

1443
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:37,411
Wait, wait.

1444
01:13:37,695 --> 01:13:39,078
Hold on.

1445
01:13:39,329 --> 01:13:40,221
Uh...

1446
01:13:40,245 --> 01:13:42,694
You might have misunderstood.

1447
01:13:42,695 --> 01:13:45,028
Jun was the main guy.

1448
01:13:45,245 --> 01:13:46,711
I was just his lackey.

1449
01:13:47,045 --> 01:13:48,744
My nickname is Devil,

1450
01:13:48,745 --> 01:13:50,894
not because I was bad to you,

1451
01:13:50,895 --> 01:13:52,911
but because I tortured them.

1452
01:13:52,912 --> 01:13:54,261
That's how I got the name.

1453
01:13:54,262 --> 01:13:55,961
Where is Hellgate?

1454
01:13:55,962 --> 01:13:57,771
I told you, I don't know! It's true!

1455
01:13:57,795 --> 01:13:59,220
I really don't remember!

1456
01:13:59,244 --> 01:13:59,961
I don't know, really!

1457
01:13:59,962 --> 01:14:02,594
I honestly don't know. That was ages ago.

1458
01:14:02,595 --> 01:14:04,778
I'm old, I can't even remember yesterday.

1459
01:14:05,812 --> 01:14:06,811
Damn it.

1460
01:14:06,812 --> 01:14:08,604
Just as I thought.

1461
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:10,478
It'd be hard to make you talk.

1462
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,078
It's not like that!

1463
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:15,078
I really don't know, so I can't say!

1464
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:16,611
Damn it.

1465
01:14:16,612 --> 01:14:18,711
Why only hit me?

1466
01:14:19,362 --> 01:14:21,421
What about that kid over there?

1467
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:22,685
Ask him!

1468
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,628
Maybe he knows.

1469
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:25,678
Is that so?

1470
01:14:28,712 --> 01:14:29,661
You know something?

1471
01:14:29,662 --> 01:14:31,428
No, I don't know anything.

1472
01:14:31,712 --> 01:14:33,378
I wasn't even a Shield Team back then.

1473
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:34,679
Right?

1474
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:35,978
You didn't know, did you?

1475
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,378
That guy... that devil... he knows everything.

1476
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:38,994
Hit him a few more times.

1477
01:14:38,995 --> 01:14:40,794
You despicable bastard!

1478
01:14:40,795 --> 01:14:42,911
Can you even call yourself
a Shield Team acting like that?

1479
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:43,544
Bastard!

1480
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:44,546
Son of a bitch!

1481
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,044
Why drag me into this? Damn it!

1482
01:14:46,045 --> 01:14:47,461
What did you say, bastard?

1483
01:14:47,462 --> 01:14:48,561
Get over here!

1484
01:14:48,562 --> 01:14:50,628
- Get over here!
- You come here! Come on!

1485
01:14:50,629 --> 01:14:52,611
- Am I scared of you, bastard?
- How interesting.

1486
01:14:52,612 --> 01:14:53,444
Go on.

1487
01:14:53,445 --> 01:14:54,456
You need to take a few more hits.

1488
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,528
Hit him more!

1489
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:57,828
- Damn it!
- Hit him! Hit him!

1490
01:14:57,829 --> 01:15:00,144
- Hit him more!
- Seriously...

1491
01:15:00,145 --> 01:15:02,528
- You bastard!
- Just kill him.

1492
01:15:02,562 --> 01:15:04,111
Yeah. That's right.

1493
01:15:04,262 --> 01:15:06,694
- Damn it!
- Stop it!

1494
01:15:09,562 --> 01:15:10,611
Is that enough now?

1495
01:15:11,779 --> 01:15:14,661
Why is there never a peaceful day

1496
01:15:15,722 --> 01:15:17,652
for Cartoonist Kim's webtoon?

1497
01:15:17,676 --> 01:15:18,604
What a hassle.

1498
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:22,294
Agent Jun.

1499
01:15:22,879 --> 01:15:24,461
- Editor-in-chief?
- What?

1500
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:26,428
Yes, I am...

1501
01:15:27,129 --> 01:15:28,129
But who are you?

1502
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:54,461
Holding out this long without talking.

1503
01:15:55,229 --> 01:15:57,461
Impressive, Devil Cheon Deok-gyu.

1504
01:15:58,695 --> 01:15:59,828
I don't know how

1505
01:16:00,329 --> 01:16:02,411
to say this, brat.

1506
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:04,878
I've found the location of Hellgate.

1507
01:16:05,029 --> 01:16:07,128
It's in the headquarters' underground storage.

1508
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:08,711
How could you know?

1509
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:10,511
That's classified information!

1510
01:16:12,462 --> 01:16:14,728
Didn't you say you didn't know?

1511
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:17,094
You told me yourselves when you were drunk.

1512
01:16:17,212 --> 01:16:19,094
There's nothing I can't find out.

1513
01:16:19,095 --> 01:16:21,378
You liar!

1514
01:16:21,379 --> 01:16:23,344
You damn nerd!

1515
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:24,344
How dare you lead me on?

1516
01:16:24,345 --> 01:16:25,778
Did you ever really

1517
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:26,944
love me?

1518
01:16:28,095 --> 01:16:31,961
Shorty...

1519
01:16:32,145 --> 01:16:33,778
Let's begin.

1520
01:16:34,562 --> 01:16:35,562
Damn it!

1521
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:39,204
How do you plan to get in there?

1522
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,578
Do you think we agents are just scarecrows?

1523
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:51,761
To catch me, you've all set up

1524
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:53,594
an ambush at the bank, haven't you?

1525
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:04,011
- Come on.
- Young man.

1526
01:17:04,062 --> 01:17:04,928
Yes?

1527
01:17:04,929 --> 01:17:06,361
Where is the restroom?

1528
01:17:06,512 --> 01:17:08,144
Go straight that way,

1529
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:09,528
then turn right.

1530
01:17:09,645 --> 01:17:11,111
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1531
01:17:11,145 --> 01:17:13,278
So your headquarters

1532
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,028
is empty now,

1533
01:17:15,445 --> 01:17:16,445
right?

1534
01:17:18,862 --> 01:17:20,078
Lately,

1535
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:22,794
to use your Southern expression,

1536
01:17:23,362 --> 01:17:24,794
feeling wronged?

1537
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:33,521
These guys...

1538
01:17:33,545 --> 01:17:35,555
Why aren't they faster?

1539
01:17:35,579 --> 01:17:38,521
They're so slow.

1540
01:17:49,095 --> 01:17:50,194
Chief,

1541
01:17:50,262 --> 01:17:52,061
what exactly is Hellgate?

1542
01:17:52,595 --> 01:17:53,788
It's a nuclear bomb.

1543
01:17:53,812 --> 01:17:54,394
What?

1544
01:17:54,395 --> 01:17:56,411
Does our country have nuclear bombs?

1545
01:17:56,645 --> 01:17:57,778
In the past, North Korea

1546
01:17:57,812 --> 01:18:00,094
built it using former Soviet technology.

1547
01:18:00,995 --> 01:18:02,411
A former Soviet nuclear bomb.

1548
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:04,628
Because it's portable,

1549
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:07,421
it can be detonated anytime, anywhere.

1550
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:09,461
Did Jun steal it?

1551
01:18:13,495 --> 01:18:15,188
<i>Intelligence suggests North
Korea plans to use Hellgate</i>

1552
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:18,294
<i>to overthrow the southern regime.</i>

1553
01:18:18,295 --> 01:18:22,344
<i>To deal with Hellgate,
the government dispatched special agents.</i>

1554
01:18:23,929 --> 01:18:25,844
<i>So that agent was Jun.</i>

1555
01:18:25,845 --> 01:18:28,905
<i>But then North and South Korea
suddenly entered a peace mode.</i>

1556
01:18:28,929 --> 01:18:31,061
The government canceled the operation.

1557
01:18:31,095 --> 01:18:34,405
But that was after Jun had
already successfully taken Hellgate.

1558
01:18:34,429 --> 01:18:36,661
Being too good is also a problem.

1559
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:39,921
Hearing that someone took Hellgate,
the North Korean commander

1560
01:18:39,945 --> 01:18:42,311
held everyone involved accountable.

1561
01:18:42,312 --> 01:18:44,444
Not just Jang Cheol-ryong,

1562
01:18:44,445 --> 01:18:46,994
but all their relatives were
targeted for elimination.

1563
01:18:46,995 --> 01:18:49,544
At the time,
it was reported they were all eliminated.

1564
01:18:49,945 --> 01:18:52,794
Afterwards, he blamed himself for a long time.

1565
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,044
He thought they were all dead.

1566
01:18:56,245 --> 01:18:58,855
Hellgate could kill all the citizens of Seoul.

1567
01:18:58,879 --> 01:18:59,361
What?

1568
01:18:59,362 --> 01:19:00,688
We must stop it.

1569
01:19:00,712 --> 01:19:02,155
We can't even move right now.

1570
01:19:02,179 --> 01:19:03,644
How are we supposed to stop it?

1571
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:06,715
Siri.

1572
01:19:06,762 --> 01:19:07,928
What?

1573
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:08,999
Siri.

1574
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:09,628
What?

1575
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:10,376
Siri.

1576
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:11,644
What's going on?

1577
01:19:11,645 --> 01:19:13,028
Be quiet.

1578
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:15,338
Did you hide your phone there?

1579
01:19:15,362 --> 01:19:16,894
Why isn't it responding?

1580
01:19:18,235 --> 01:19:20,428
I got hit so hard my tongue feels weird.

1581
01:19:20,895 --> 01:19:22,411
You're full of tricks, aren't you?

1582
01:19:24,495 --> 01:19:25,495
Yes.

1583
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:29,687
Siri, call Kim Mong-jun.

1584
01:19:29,712 --> 01:19:31,467
Kim Mong-jun.

1585
01:19:38,045 --> 01:19:38,888
Hello?

1586
01:19:38,912 --> 01:19:40,261
- Bad news!
- Chief?

1587
01:19:40,655 --> 01:19:42,837
I can't hear clearly!
Something terrible happened!

1588
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,155
It's very urgent! Urgent!

1589
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,078
Speak closer! I can't hear!

1590
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:47,428
Hey, you tell me!

1591
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:49,511
- What should I do?
- Come over here.

1592
01:19:51,595 --> 01:19:52,595
Come here.

1593
01:19:55,395 --> 01:19:57,311
Bro, bad news!

1594
01:19:57,312 --> 01:19:58,561
What's the bad news?

1595
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:01,111
It was all Jang Cheol-ryong doing.

1596
01:20:01,112 --> 01:20:02,155
It was all

1597
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:03,528
Jang Cheol-ryong doing.

1598
01:20:04,029 --> 01:20:05,029
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1599
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:06,088
Hellgate?

1600
01:20:06,112 --> 01:20:06,938
Yes, exactly.

1601
01:20:06,962 --> 01:20:07,921
That Hellgate.

1602
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:09,711
Recreating scenes from your webtoon

1603
01:20:10,312 --> 01:20:12,778
It's also a distraction to divert
our key personnel's attention.

1604
01:20:12,812 --> 01:20:14,644
Recreating scenes from your webtoon

1605
01:20:14,645 --> 01:20:16,899
It's also a distraction to divert...

1606
01:20:16,923 --> 01:20:17,744
What?

1607
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:18,894
A distraction.

1608
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:19,378
What kind of distraction?

1609
01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:20,705
A distraction, you ignorant fool!

1610
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:21,729
Anyway,

1611
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:24,494
what they want is Hellgate.

1612
01:20:24,495 --> 01:20:26,378
- Isn't Hellgate decommissioned?
- No.

1613
01:20:26,462 --> 01:20:29,444
It's right there at headquarters where you are,

1614
01:20:29,495 --> 01:20:31,794
kept in the special underground storage room.

1615
01:20:31,845 --> 01:20:33,521
He said it's at the headquarters where you are now,

1616
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:35,855
in the special underground management room.

1617
01:20:35,879 --> 01:20:37,044
Fortunately, they still don't know

1618
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:38,678
you're there right now.

1619
01:20:38,995 --> 01:20:40,250
It's up to you now, Bro.

1620
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:41,694
You have to stop all this.

1621
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:43,021
Where are you and the Chief now?

1622
01:20:43,045 --> 01:20:43,955
Right now,

1623
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:46,488
we're locked in the basement
warehouse of sister-in-law's gallery.

1624
01:20:46,512 --> 01:20:47,655
Oh, and also...

1625
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,261
That employee with sister-in-law...

1626
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:50,355
She's a fraud.

1627
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:53,028
Damn it. We were both deceived.

1628
01:20:54,812 --> 01:20:56,988
Chief, a new chapter has been uploaded.

1629
01:20:57,012 --> 01:20:58,121
Did you upload it?

1630
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,828
No, it wasn't me.

1631
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:00,944
Then who did?

1632
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:04,378
This art style is exactly

1633
01:21:04,995 --> 01:21:06,161
the same as mine.

1634
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:24,137
Explosion in Gangnam.

1635
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:25,921
- Chaos!
- Police dispatched!

1636
01:21:25,945 --> 01:21:28,878
Explosion in southern Seoul at the same time.

1637
01:21:29,695 --> 01:21:31,411
Who the hell is this guy?

1638
01:21:31,412 --> 01:21:32,711
Today...

1639
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:35,211
this country...

1640
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:37,844
will disappear.

1641
01:21:39,212 --> 01:21:43,094
Starting today,
there's only one way to save this rotten country.

1642
01:21:43,162 --> 01:21:45,488
- Hell!
- Hellgate!

1643
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,811
No! The moment that explodes, we're all done for!

1644
01:21:48,129 --> 01:21:49,761
Dispatch people immediately!

1645
01:21:50,545 --> 01:21:53,644
Are you perhaps looking for Agent Jun?

1646
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:56,028
The one trained to be a weapon,

1647
01:21:56,262 --> 01:21:58,821
forced to give up all dreams and hope...

1648
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:00,278
Agent Jun.

1649
01:22:00,395 --> 01:22:03,561
Should I now call him cartoonist

1650
01:22:03,845 --> 01:22:05,828
Kim Soo-hyuk?

1651
01:22:06,562 --> 01:22:07,505
How do you know that?

1652
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:10,078
There's no cartoonist Kim Soo-hyuk anymore.

1653
01:22:10,112 --> 01:22:12,244
Nor Agent Jun.

1654
01:22:12,445 --> 01:22:14,161
What's left now

1655
01:22:15,112 --> 01:22:17,444
is only the terrorist Jun.

1656
01:22:19,545 --> 01:22:20,545
Jun!

1657
01:22:20,912 --> 01:22:22,428
What exactly are you doing?

1658
01:22:25,212 --> 01:22:27,128
No one

1659
01:22:27,829 --> 01:22:29,478
can stop me now.

1660
01:22:37,462 --> 01:22:38,462
No!

1661
01:22:52,195 --> 01:22:54,578
Everyone, he finally confessed.

1662
01:22:54,695 --> 01:22:56,087
I was right.

1663
01:22:56,111 --> 01:22:58,044
Cartoonist Kim is the assassin.

1664
01:22:58,195 --> 01:22:59,828
But did you all see?

1665
01:22:59,829 --> 01:23:02,971
This time,
a nuclear bomb will be detonated in Seoul.

1666
01:23:02,995 --> 01:23:05,878
- Now...
- You'll all really die!

1667
01:23:05,912 --> 01:23:09,321
The moment the nuke explodes, Seoul will melt!

1668
01:23:09,345 --> 01:23:10,345
Mom, what should I do?

1669
01:23:14,462 --> 01:23:15,511
Look at this.

1670
01:23:15,595 --> 01:23:18,561
Debate King was right.
Cartoonist Kim really is Agent Jun.

1671
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:20,321
Will they really detonate a nuke?

1672
01:23:20,345 --> 01:23:21,213
Hey!

1673
01:23:21,237 --> 01:23:23,028
That's insane! Then we'll all die!

1674
01:23:23,179 --> 01:23:24,411
What do you mean, die?

1675
01:23:27,312 --> 01:23:28,312
Dad.

1676
01:23:36,529 --> 01:23:38,411
Honey, what's with this webtoon?

1677
01:23:38,412 --> 01:23:39,511
Are you crazy?

1678
01:23:39,995 --> 01:23:41,421
I didn't draw that.

1679
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:42,594
Then who drew it?

1680
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:44,355
You obviously drew it!

1681
01:23:44,379 --> 01:23:45,711
Trust me. Besides,

1682
01:23:46,212 --> 01:23:47,555
now's not the time to worry about that.

1683
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:48,411
Where are you right now?

1684
01:23:48,412 --> 01:23:50,211
Me? I'm at the gallery.

1685
01:23:50,236 --> 01:23:51,568
- What's wrong?
- Honey.

1686
01:23:55,212 --> 01:23:56,844
I need you to do something.

1687
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:10,205
What is it?

1688
01:24:10,229 --> 01:24:11,861
We shouldn't have everyone spread out guarding.

1689
01:24:12,395 --> 01:24:13,861
Quickly contact Deputy Director Chae Hong-ju!

1690
01:24:13,895 --> 01:24:15,528
He's in a special operation. Can't be reached.

1691
01:24:15,695 --> 01:24:16,695
Damn it.

1692
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:21,661
Welcome.

1693
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:22,805
- Hello.
- Hello.

1694
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:24,138
How can I help you?

1695
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:26,428
I'd like to open a savings account for my child.

1696
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,628
Please wait at window number 5.

1697
01:24:29,629 --> 01:24:31,844
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1698
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:41,111
- How's the situation.
- Not yet.

1699
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:44,611
Stay in your positions.

1700
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:45,811
Stay alert.

1701
01:24:48,145 --> 01:24:49,005
Hello.

1702
01:24:49,029 --> 01:24:50,112
Excuse me, sir.

1703
01:24:50,136 --> 01:24:51,255
Could you help me get some change?

1704
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:52,661
Okay. Right this way.

1705
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:56,078
Where's the restroom?

1706
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:57,911
- That way, please.
- Okay.

1707
01:25:07,295 --> 01:25:08,295
Let's begin.

1708
01:25:13,295 --> 01:25:14,428
Explosives.

1709
01:25:14,429 --> 01:25:15,728
All key personnel, standby.

1710
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:19,094
Descend. 300 meters to target.

1711
01:25:39,645 --> 01:25:40,538
Damn it.

1712
01:25:40,562 --> 01:25:41,644
Who the hell are these people?

1713
01:25:43,345 --> 01:25:44,561
Who are you?

1714
01:25:48,529 --> 01:25:49,529
Come have a drink.

1715
01:25:49,695 --> 01:25:50,228
Okay?

1716
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,194
Come have a drink.

1717
01:25:52,195 --> 01:25:53,195
My treat.

1718
01:25:53,812 --> 01:25:56,111
Where are we drinking?

1719
01:25:56,279 --> 01:25:57,494
This guy...

1720
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:00,088
You hit me first.

1721
01:26:00,112 --> 01:26:01,112
- Okay?
- What?

1722
01:26:08,045 --> 01:26:09,045
You punk!

1723
01:26:13,379 --> 01:26:15,844
Go down!

1724
01:26:18,295 --> 01:26:20,861
Bastard! Asshole!

1725
01:26:20,929 --> 01:26:22,861
Pervert! Hooligan!

1726
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:24,944
Son of a bitch!

1727
01:26:28,812 --> 01:26:29,778
Sister-in-law.

1728
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:30,861
Sister-in-law!

1729
01:26:31,195 --> 01:26:32,994
This is really...

1730
01:26:35,945 --> 01:26:37,088
Wait.

1731
01:26:37,112 --> 01:26:38,305
Stay together. Okay.

1732
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:39,329
Stand up.

1733
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:41,294
Hold on.

1734
01:26:44,195 --> 01:26:45,195
Stop.

1735
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:53,761
Since the signal cut out,

1736
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:02,728
the server connection failed.

1737
01:27:02,729 --> 01:27:03,955
External communication is cut off.

1738
01:27:03,979 --> 01:27:05,661
It seems like someone is jamming the signal.

1739
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,778
All communications are completely cut off.

1740
01:27:45,562 --> 01:27:47,988
Where do you think this is? How dare you barge in?

1741
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:49,394
This is the NIS!

1742
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,694
If you want to live,

1743
01:27:56,929 --> 01:27:58,944
play all the internal surveillance footage.

1744
01:28:00,612 --> 01:28:01,371
Yes.

1745
01:28:01,395 --> 01:28:02,578
Understood.

1746
01:28:10,795 --> 01:28:11,795
What is this?

1747
01:29:01,262 --> 01:29:02,394
No.

1748
01:29:02,812 --> 01:29:03,844
It's them.

1749
01:29:03,929 --> 01:29:05,978
How many combat-ready agents are here right now?

1750
01:29:06,462 --> 01:29:07,462
Just me.

1751
01:29:08,179 --> 01:29:09,179
What?

1752
01:29:10,895 --> 01:29:11,895
Give me the gun.

1753
01:29:12,145 --> 01:29:12,905
No way.

1754
01:29:12,929 --> 01:29:15,194
The Deputy Director said I absolutely
cannot let you act rashly.

1755
01:29:15,229 --> 01:29:16,828
I'm Agent Jun.

1756
01:29:52,812 --> 01:29:53,828
Pursue quickly!

1757
01:29:59,945 --> 01:30:02,244
Quickly report the situation

1758
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:03,144
to Deputy Director Chae Hong-ju
and request backup.

1759
01:30:03,145 --> 01:30:04,411
Do you need my help?

1760
01:30:05,362 --> 01:30:07,328
Back off if you don't want to die.

1761
01:30:13,962 --> 01:30:15,928
You need to come see this.

1762
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:28,761
Looks like there's an intruder.

1763
01:30:28,788 --> 01:30:29,804
Interesting.

1764
01:31:03,045 --> 01:31:05,478
Congratulations, you are now free.

1765
01:31:06,145 --> 01:31:08,344
I'll give you one more chance.

1766
01:31:08,345 --> 01:31:10,261
Jun is near you right now.

1767
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:13,061
What did you lose because of him?

1768
01:31:13,562 --> 01:31:15,178
My eyes.

1769
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:16,311
My fingers.

1770
01:31:16,312 --> 01:31:18,061
My handsome face.

1771
01:31:18,262 --> 01:31:20,894
What did you lose?

1772
01:31:22,695 --> 01:31:24,161
My everything...

1773
01:31:29,695 --> 01:31:31,844
Jun is in this building right now.

1774
01:31:32,162 --> 01:31:34,211
I'll tell you his location.

1775
01:31:34,695 --> 01:31:36,378
Jun!

1776
01:31:36,612 --> 01:31:37,844
Jun!

1777
01:32:02,312 --> 01:32:04,671
An assassin trained by the state,

1778
01:32:04,695 --> 01:32:06,361
taking revenge on the state.

1779
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:08,211
That's really something.

1780
01:32:09,945 --> 01:32:11,244
Hey. Did you upload that?

1781
01:32:11,445 --> 01:32:13,594
Although I drew it,

1782
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:15,794
I wrote the story myself.

1783
01:32:15,862 --> 01:32:18,555
Who the hell do you think you are,
ruining someone else's work?

1784
01:32:18,579 --> 01:32:20,294
I thought you, of all people, would understand.

1785
01:32:20,995 --> 01:32:23,188
Why would Agent Jun become a terrorist?

1786
01:32:23,212 --> 01:32:25,471
What did the country you dedicated

1787
01:32:25,495 --> 01:32:26,894
your life to ever do for you?

1788
01:32:28,345 --> 01:32:30,261
You should hate the country too, right?

1789
01:32:30,345 --> 01:32:32,311
I have things I must protect.

1790
01:32:32,345 --> 01:32:34,228
A lovely wife

1791
01:32:35,412 --> 01:32:36,412
and daughter.

1792
01:32:38,812 --> 01:32:39,944
I used to have that too.

1793
01:32:43,062 --> 01:32:46,778
Before my whole family was killed because of you.

1794
01:32:47,545 --> 01:32:48,994
I regret what happened to your family.

1795
01:32:49,879 --> 01:32:51,094
Why don't you just kill me

1796
01:32:51,095 --> 01:32:51,988
and take your revenge?

1797
01:32:52,012 --> 01:32:53,278
If Hellgate explodes,

1798
01:32:53,695 --> 01:32:55,561
countless innocent people will die.

1799
01:32:59,179 --> 01:33:00,194
So righteous?

1800
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:02,828
Were my family members who
died that day guilty then?

1801
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:08,328
The inhumane hell of that day,

1802
01:33:09,195 --> 01:33:11,044
I will show everyone today.

1803
01:33:12,495 --> 01:33:13,495
Stay tuned.

1804
01:33:13,579 --> 01:33:15,078
You lunatic!

1805
01:33:17,795 --> 01:33:18,878
Look at these guys.

1806
01:33:19,462 --> 01:33:20,711
How did you get out?

1807
01:33:21,879 --> 01:33:23,878
We can't just kill him easily.

1808
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:25,811
He needs to die painfully.

1809
01:33:38,729 --> 01:33:39,729
Move.

1810
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:41,179
Let's go.

1811
01:34:19,312 --> 01:34:21,028
You guys...

1812
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:22,811
You still want to get thrashed?

1813
01:35:11,395 --> 01:35:12,395
Why aren't they here yet?

1814
01:35:13,195 --> 01:35:15,628
Uh, business hours are over.

1815
01:35:16,379 --> 01:35:18,244
Uh, hold on.

1816
01:35:22,879 --> 01:35:23,805
You scared me!

1817
01:35:23,829 --> 01:35:24,721
You kid!

1818
01:35:24,745 --> 01:35:26,105
Why are you here?

1819
01:35:26,129 --> 01:35:27,271
I told you to stay with Jun.

1820
01:35:27,295 --> 01:35:28,271
Deputy Director...

1821
01:35:28,295 --> 01:35:29,594
Headquarters was hit by a terrorist attack.

1822
01:35:30,295 --> 01:35:31,311
What did you say?

1823
01:35:31,879 --> 01:35:33,511
Almost completely wiped out.

1824
01:35:44,562 --> 01:35:45,728
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1825
01:36:05,379 --> 01:36:06,379
Stop.

1826
01:36:13,762 --> 01:36:14,688
Take care of them.

1827
01:36:14,712 --> 01:36:15,712
Follow me.

1828
01:36:21,145 --> 01:36:22,145
Like it?

1829
01:36:32,145 --> 01:36:33,611
They're acting like idiots, Bro.

1830
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:35,778
Just you wait.

1831
01:36:35,995 --> 01:36:41,211
We're heading over.

1832
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,578
Let's go.

1833
01:37:45,145 --> 01:37:45,988
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1834
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:47,778
Let's settle this.

1835
01:37:48,145 --> 01:37:49,145
What?

1836
01:37:49,395 --> 01:37:50,444
Scared now that you see me?

1837
01:37:51,729 --> 01:37:52,729
Make way.

1838
01:38:00,612 --> 01:38:01,612
Damn it!

1839
01:38:07,329 --> 01:38:08,544
You bastards!

1840
01:38:09,462 --> 01:38:11,961
The numbers aren't even, you despicable bastards!

1841
01:38:11,962 --> 01:38:12,962
Chief.

1842
01:38:18,845 --> 01:38:19,845
Hey!

1843
01:38:20,295 --> 01:38:21,295
Damn!

1844
01:38:23,845 --> 01:38:24,845
Damn it!

1845
01:38:31,562 --> 01:38:32,562
Missed every shot.

1846
01:38:32,595 --> 01:38:33,595
Damn it!

1847
01:38:33,862 --> 01:38:35,194
These guys are out of bullets!

1848
01:38:35,195 --> 01:38:36,628
Calling you bad is an understatement.

1849
01:38:36,895 --> 01:38:39,111
You bastards! That's not how you hold it!

1850
01:38:39,195 --> 01:38:40,544
Get them!

1851
01:38:42,995 --> 01:38:44,194
Come on!

1852
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,478
My work ended because of you.

1853
01:38:56,345 --> 01:38:58,111
No matter how I look at it, I can't forgive you.

1854
01:38:58,262 --> 01:39:00,978
Agent Jun should have ended long ago.

1855
01:39:01,612 --> 01:39:02,744
Trash like that

1856
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:04,611
should have disappeared long ago.

1857
01:39:04,612 --> 01:39:05,612
Agent Jun...

1858
01:39:06,312 --> 01:39:07,328
isn't over yet.

1859
01:39:08,695 --> 01:39:09,828
Even if it ends, I'll be the one to end it.

1860
01:39:20,845 --> 01:39:21,978
Farewell.

1861
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:33,844
You shouldn't have touched my face
or disregarded my sincerity.

1862
01:39:33,845 --> 01:39:35,178
Hilarious.

1863
01:39:35,179 --> 01:39:36,894
That is all just in your head.

1864
01:39:37,562 --> 01:39:38,562
Isn't it?

1865
01:39:38,595 --> 01:39:39,894
I can't forgive you.

1866
01:39:40,645 --> 01:39:42,728
Oh my god, Mr. Deok-gyu.

1867
01:39:43,312 --> 01:39:45,278
You think you can hit me?

1868
01:39:49,329 --> 01:39:50,728
I'm the Devil Drill Instructor.

1869
01:39:51,762 --> 01:39:53,478
Does a devil care if they hit a man or a woman?

1870
01:39:54,095 --> 01:39:55,428
You!

1871
01:39:57,712 --> 01:39:59,761
You're not on my level. Too slow.

1872
01:39:59,762 --> 01:40:01,111
What did you say?

1873
01:40:06,345 --> 01:40:07,361
I take it back.

1874
01:40:49,062 --> 01:40:50,062
Doesn't it hurt?

1875
01:40:52,145 --> 01:40:53,145
My hand hurts.

1876
01:41:07,945 --> 01:41:09,778
While you were drawing those comics...

1877
01:41:10,229 --> 01:41:11,894
I was fighting on the battlefield.

1878
01:41:11,895 --> 01:41:12,895
It's just a webtoon.

1879
01:41:13,495 --> 01:41:14,495
What do you know?

1880
01:41:28,545 --> 01:41:30,844
Oh my god, it moved.

1881
01:41:30,845 --> 01:41:32,511
That's disgusting.

1882
01:41:34,095 --> 01:41:35,095
And you're laughing?

1883
01:41:44,595 --> 01:41:45,595
Hello?

1884
01:41:52,562 --> 01:41:53,562
Mr. Deok-gyu, hold on! Hold on tight!

1885
01:41:57,245 --> 01:41:59,078
I used to like you.

1886
01:41:59,195 --> 01:42:00,411
Mr. Deok-gyu!

1887
01:42:09,712 --> 01:42:10,712
A little more.

1888
01:42:29,529 --> 01:42:31,411
Bastard.

1889
01:42:54,679 --> 01:42:55,405
Chief!

1890
01:42:55,429 --> 01:42:56,128
Chief!

1891
01:42:56,129 --> 01:42:57,129
How outrageous!

1892
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:58,629
Die!

1893
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:05,194
You were already tricked like that,
and you fell for it again!

1894
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,228
You've really lived all these years for nothing!

1895
01:43:07,929 --> 01:43:09,844
What did you say? Bastard! Get over here!

1896
01:43:09,845 --> 01:43:12,628
You! Get over here! Hey! Get over here!

1897
01:43:12,629 --> 01:43:14,344
Fuck you...

1898
01:43:43,529 --> 01:43:44,711
Stop Hellgate.

1899
01:43:45,579 --> 01:43:46,579
What?

1900
01:43:46,829 --> 01:43:48,044
Are you scared?

1901
01:44:16,279 --> 01:44:18,328
See you in hell.

1902
01:44:26,329 --> 01:44:28,294
- It's gonna blow!
- There's no time!

1903
01:44:30,862 --> 01:44:32,378
Load Hellgate onto the helicopter and fly it out.

1904
01:44:32,379 --> 01:44:33,544
It has to detonate over the sea.

1905
01:44:33,829 --> 01:44:36,261
Above 30 kilometers, or there will be damage.

1906
01:44:37,295 --> 01:44:39,211
Bro, who's flying the helicopter?

1907
01:44:39,212 --> 01:44:40,587
- I'll...
- Chief!

1908
01:44:41,845 --> 01:44:43,511
What the hell?

1909
01:44:43,512 --> 01:44:45,178
I haven't even gotten married yet!

1910
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:46,294
Didn't you say you were married to the country?

1911
01:44:46,295 --> 01:44:48,444
To hell with the country!

1912
01:44:51,629 --> 01:44:52,521
Soo-hyuk.

1913
01:44:52,545 --> 01:44:53,438
No way!

1914
01:44:53,462 --> 01:44:54,462
I...

1915
01:44:54,629 --> 01:44:56,544
I've never even had a girlfriend!

1916
01:44:57,162 --> 01:44:58,544
Didn't you date someone?

1917
01:44:58,545 --> 01:45:00,011
Bro, you're married with kids!

1918
01:45:00,012 --> 01:45:01,511
I haven't even had my first kiss!

1919
01:45:01,512 --> 01:45:03,561
Then what are we supposed to do?

1920
01:45:03,562 --> 01:45:04,811
There's no time!

1921
01:45:05,062 --> 01:45:06,062
Chief!

1922
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:06,811
Jun.

1923
01:45:06,812 --> 01:45:07,812
You guys are unbelievable...

1924
01:45:08,062 --> 01:45:09,311
Don't you know I have a wife and daughter?

1925
01:45:09,312 --> 01:45:11,361
But the bomb's about to explode!

1926
01:45:17,112 --> 01:45:19,611
As chief of the Shield team,
I have something to say.

1927
01:45:20,445 --> 01:45:22,194
There's really no other choice.

1928
01:45:23,229 --> 01:45:24,138
Chief!

1929
01:45:24,162 --> 01:45:25,461
Is this really the only way?

1930
01:45:25,995 --> 01:45:26,995
Yeah.

1931
01:45:30,329 --> 01:45:32,378
If you don't play you lose,
Rock Paper Scissors.

1932
01:45:32,379 --> 01:45:34,211
Rock Paper Scissors!

1933
01:45:34,379 --> 01:45:35,379
Rock Paper Scissors!

1934
01:45:39,079 --> 01:45:40,461
A real man always plays rock!

1935
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:52,762
Chief!

1936
01:45:53,595 --> 01:45:54,595
Jun!

1937
01:45:55,112 --> 01:45:56,112
Please take care

1938
01:45:56,362 --> 01:45:57,362
of my family.

1939
01:45:57,445 --> 01:45:58,255
Jun...

1940
01:45:58,279 --> 01:45:59,279
Bro...

1941
01:46:00,395 --> 01:46:01,728
Bro, thank you.

1942
01:46:01,729 --> 01:46:02,729
Jun...

1943
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:04,171
Ge...

1944
01:46:04,195 --> 01:46:05,195
Jun!

1945
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:06,411
Jun!

1946
01:46:39,229 --> 01:46:40,229
Hello?

1947
01:46:40,445 --> 01:46:41,445
Honey?

1948
01:46:42,112 --> 01:46:43,361
Honey, are you okay?

1949
01:46:43,645 --> 01:46:44,611
Are you sure you're alright?

1950
01:46:44,612 --> 01:46:45,612
Yeah, I'm fine.

1951
01:46:46,229 --> 01:46:46,944
What about Ga-yeong?

1952
01:46:46,945 --> 01:46:48,794
Dad, I'm here, next to Mom.

1953
01:46:49,162 --> 01:46:50,494
Ga-yeong's right here. Don't worry.

1954
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:52,044
I was so worried about you.

1955
01:46:52,862 --> 01:46:54,078
Dad, what's that sound?

1956
01:46:54,362 --> 01:46:55,362
Why is it so noisy?

1957
01:46:55,829 --> 01:46:56,829
I'm in a helicopter right now.

1958
01:46:57,129 --> 01:46:58,129
What do you mean, you're in a helicopter?

1959
01:46:58,379 --> 01:46:59,594
I found the bomb,

1960
01:47:00,745 --> 01:47:01,711
but I can't stop it.

1961
01:47:01,712 --> 01:47:02,878
What does that mean?

1962
01:47:03,295 --> 01:47:05,094
Then what are you going to do?

1963
01:47:05,929 --> 01:47:07,978
I have to fly it out over
the sea and let it explode.

1964
01:47:08,512 --> 01:47:09,928
What are you talking about?

1965
01:47:09,929 --> 01:47:11,728
- Why are you doing that?
- Yeah!

1966
01:47:11,929 --> 01:47:14,311
Let someone else do it!
Why does it have to be you?

1967
01:47:14,312 --> 01:47:15,444
To detonate it safely,

1968
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:16,761
it has to be me.

1969
01:47:16,762 --> 01:47:19,194
Honey, don't do this.

1970
01:47:19,645 --> 01:47:20,645
Honey...

1971
01:47:21,262 --> 01:47:22,778
It must have been hard being with me, right?

1972
01:47:24,862 --> 01:47:25,862
I really love you.

1973
01:47:27,562 --> 01:47:28,562
Our Ga-yeong,

1974
01:47:29,195 --> 01:47:30,194
you must raise her well.

1975
01:47:30,195 --> 01:47:31,483
Honey, why are you acting like this?

1976
01:47:31,507 --> 01:47:32,244
Stop it.

1977
01:47:32,495 --> 01:47:33,495
Ga-yeong.

1978
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:34,794
Be good and listen to Mom.

1979
01:47:36,029 --> 01:47:37,378
Stay healthy.

1980
01:47:39,962 --> 01:47:41,094
To Mom and me,

1981
01:47:42,495 --> 01:47:43,961
you are the most precious thing.

1982
01:47:45,329 --> 01:47:46,894
Dad, I'm sorry.

1983
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:48,679
Sorry for what?

1984
01:47:52,345 --> 01:47:54,928
I was too mean to you.

1985
01:47:55,429 --> 01:47:56,478
No, no.

1986
01:47:56,729 --> 01:47:57,729
It's nothing like that.

1987
01:47:58,229 --> 01:47:59,229
Dad, it's okay.

1988
01:48:00,062 --> 01:48:01,228
It's okay because I'm your dad.

1989
01:48:02,345 --> 01:48:03,911
Dad, I'm sorry.

1990
01:48:07,695 --> 01:48:09,744
Ga-yeong, I love you.

1991
01:48:11,779 --> 01:48:12,779
Honey...

1992
01:48:14,529 --> 01:48:16,128
The best thing I ever did in my life

1993
01:48:17,745 --> 01:48:18,745
was meeting you

1994
01:48:19,879 --> 01:48:21,011
and having our daughter.

1995
01:48:23,662 --> 01:48:24,662
I love you.

1996
01:48:25,712 --> 01:48:26,712
Honey...

1997
01:48:26,912 --> 01:48:28,161
I'm so scared.

1998
01:48:30,162 --> 01:48:31,661
The reason I played the stock market

1999
01:48:33,029 --> 01:48:34,029
was because I really wanted

2000
01:48:34,495 --> 01:48:35,661
to provide for our daughter.

2001
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:37,878
I really thought it would turn out well.

2002
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:41,128
I'm sorry for making you and Ga-yeong suffer.

2003
01:48:42,612 --> 01:48:44,228
My editor-in-chief said it would turn out well.

2004
01:48:45,979 --> 01:48:47,411
None of that matters, honey.

2005
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:49,479
Just come back.

2006
01:48:49,762 --> 01:48:51,271
Honey, just come back alive.

2007
01:48:51,295 --> 01:48:52,594
Honey, I'm sorry.

2008
01:48:53,295 --> 01:48:54,295
I love you both.

2009
01:48:55,429 --> 01:48:56,178
You two must live well.

2010
01:48:56,179 --> 01:48:57,844
Dad, don't go.

2011
01:48:57,845 --> 01:48:59,228
Without you...

2012
01:49:18,362 --> 01:49:19,362
Brother!

2013
01:49:20,045 --> 01:49:21,045
Jun!

2014
01:49:21,995 --> 01:49:26,111
Dad!

2015
01:49:27,262 --> 01:49:29,444
Honey!

2016
01:49:38,179 --> 01:49:39,861
Jun went flying over there!

2017
01:49:44,029 --> 01:49:45,029
Jun!

2018
01:49:55,695 --> 01:49:56,695
Hello?

2019
01:49:57,162 --> 01:49:58,162
Chief?

2020
01:50:00,812 --> 01:50:03,478
What's going on? This voice...

2021
01:50:04,562 --> 01:50:05,562
Is that Jun's voice? Am I hearing things?

2022
01:50:05,762 --> 01:50:07,494
What's with the reaction?

2023
01:50:07,562 --> 01:50:09,361
Chief, it's me Jun.

2024
01:50:10,612 --> 01:50:12,194
- Jun?
- It's Jun! Can't you hear me?

2025
01:50:12,195 --> 01:50:13,528
Kim Mong-jun.

2026
01:50:13,529 --> 01:50:14,529
Jun!

2027
01:50:14,862 --> 01:50:16,294
It really is you, Jun, right?

2028
01:50:17,029 --> 01:50:18,711
Where are you? You're not dead?

2029
01:50:18,995 --> 01:50:20,161
I was a Shield Team once.

2030
01:50:20,829 --> 01:50:21,829
This much is nothing.

2031
01:50:22,162 --> 01:50:23,511
You know how well I can swim.

2032
01:50:27,962 --> 01:50:29,778
Not that. The helicopter.

2033
01:50:30,145 --> 01:50:31,145
Oh, that.

2034
01:50:31,945 --> 01:50:33,094
I set it to autopilot.

2035
01:50:33,879 --> 01:50:35,728
That helicopter has autopilot?

2036
01:50:36,345 --> 01:50:37,361
Does it?

2037
01:50:57,945 --> 01:50:59,911
Forget it. Hurry and pick me up.

2038
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:02,161
Jun!

2039
01:51:08,245 --> 01:51:09,245
Dad!

2040
01:51:09,962 --> 01:51:12,011
- Honey!
- Dad!

2041
01:51:12,162 --> 01:51:13,511
Jun!

2042
01:51:13,662 --> 01:51:14,161
Jun!

2043
01:51:14,162 --> 01:51:16,361
- Honey!
- Dad!

2044
01:51:18,045 --> 01:51:19,045
Jun!

2045
01:51:20,595 --> 01:51:21,777
Honey. Ga-yeong.

2046
01:51:24,228 --> 01:51:25,228
Honey.

2047
01:51:26,429 --> 01:51:27,405
Are you okay?

2048
01:51:27,429 --> 01:51:28,204
I'm okay.

2049
01:51:28,228 --> 01:51:30,194
Gosh, I thought you were dead.

2050
01:51:30,279 --> 01:51:31,279
I wouldn't leave my family behind

2051
01:51:31,728 --> 01:51:32,698
to die.

2052
01:51:32,722 --> 01:51:33,361
I won't die.

2053
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:34,645
Dad won't die.

2054
01:51:36,062 --> 01:51:38,128
I missed you.

2055
01:51:40,912 --> 01:51:41,994
Looking at them makes me

2056
01:51:42,412 --> 01:51:43,544
want to get married.

2057
01:51:44,245 --> 01:51:45,544
I want to start a family too.

2058
01:51:46,745 --> 01:51:48,411
I don't want to date women anymore.

2059
01:51:50,045 --> 01:51:51,344
I want to marry the country.

2060
01:51:52,962 --> 01:51:53,962
Yes, that's right.

2061
01:51:54,495 --> 01:51:55,961
We should marry the country.

2062
01:51:57,629 --> 01:51:58,894
Personal relationships

2063
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:00,178
aren't for us.

2064
01:52:00,462 --> 01:52:01,438
Right.

2065
01:52:01,468 --> 01:52:02,468
For Shield Team,

2066
01:52:02,629 --> 01:52:03,894
love is meaningless.

2067
01:52:04,095 --> 01:52:05,095
Right.

2068
01:52:26,612 --> 01:52:27,620
Are you guys okay?

2069
01:52:27,644 --> 01:52:28,911
You look seriously injured.

2070
01:52:30,379 --> 01:52:32,428
Because we were fighting, I forgot about the pain.

2071
01:52:32,917 --> 01:52:34,357
Can I get some treatment?

2072
01:52:34,382 --> 01:52:36,978
Please take a look. I can see the bone in my nose.

2073
01:52:37,262 --> 01:52:38,262
- Get away.
- Chief.

2074
01:52:38,295 --> 01:52:40,428
- I want to get married.
- Weren't you going to marry the country?

2075
01:52:40,962 --> 01:52:42,228
It hasn't even been a minute since you said that.

2076
01:52:42,379 --> 01:52:44,678
Maybe this lady here is the "country."

2077
01:52:45,512 --> 01:52:46,512
Am I shaking?

2078
01:52:46,978 --> 01:52:47,978
Just let me have this one.

2079
01:52:49,228 --> 01:52:50,228
I love you.

2080
01:53:19,912 --> 01:53:21,361
- Hello?
- Cartoonist Kim?

2081
01:53:21,362 --> 01:53:23,278
How's the final issue of
'Agent Jun coming along?

2082
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:24,078
It's almost finished.

2083
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:24,611
Is that right?

2084
01:53:24,612 --> 01:53:26,994
I wanted to wait until it was confirmed,
so I didn't tell you.

2085
01:53:26,995 --> 01:53:29,261
Agent Jun is being adapted into an animation.

2086
01:53:29,295 --> 01:53:31,461
- It's happening!
- Seriously?

2087
01:53:31,795 --> 01:53:32,842
I already sent you the opening sequence.

2088
01:53:32,866 --> 01:53:33,628
Take a look.

2089
01:53:33,629 --> 01:53:35,044
Awesome!

2090
01:53:40,712 --> 01:53:42,511
Honey! Ga-yeong!

2091
01:53:42,679 --> 01:53:43,344
What's wrong?

2092
01:53:43,345 --> 01:53:44,428
My webtoon...

2093
01:53:44,978 --> 01:53:46,361
is getting an animation!

2094
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:48,061
What? Really?

2095
01:53:49,112 --> 01:53:50,428
They already sent me the opening video.

2096
01:53:50,429 --> 01:53:51,611
Really? Let me see! Let me see!

2097
01:53:51,612 --> 01:53:52,612
Here.
