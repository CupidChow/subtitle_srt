won't that be embarrassing?

188
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,470
Useless.

189
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,440
No matter where you go,
it'll be the same.

190
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,280
What?

191
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,790
The event has instructed us.

192
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,270
We all

193
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,870
have to target you.

194
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,040
Isn't that against the rules?

195
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,200
Not against the rules.

196
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,030
Even if I count faster,
what's the point?

197
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,910
You really think you can win

198
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,390
with twenty yuan?

199
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,390
Don't dream!

200
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,750
Seven hundred.

201
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,910
Eight hundred.

202
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,230
Nine hundred.

203
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,870
Shameless!

204
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,030
No bottom line!

205
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,510
Completely ruthless!

206
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,670
(What do you have to compete with me?)

207
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,750
No rules are being broken,
right, Master Nine?

208
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,440
Aren't you afraid of public opinion?

209
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,030
Shameless!

210
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,270
No bottom line!

211
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,270
Completely ruthless!

212
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,150
(Counting cash takes too much time.)

213
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,270
(There's so little time left,)

214
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,450
(and I still need to get
all the three stones ready.)

215
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,640
(What to do now?)

216
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,790
Still not giving up,

217
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,000
Shi Lai?

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,030
That's great!

219
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,030
I love

220
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,270
seeing you struggle like this.

221
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,080
(No time left.)

222
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,520
(I can only take a gamble now.)
Who wants to buy

223
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,360
(Hope I get it right!)
this raw stone at the lowest price?

224
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,230
Raise your hand.

225
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,370
The quality of this raw stone
is still quite good,

226
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,210
so let's...

227
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,870
Shi Lai rushes into
the mid-tier raw stone zone,

228
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,270
holding the cut raw stone!

229
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,620
What is he trying to do?

230
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,660
(Mid-tier Raw Stone)

231
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,550
I'll trade this raw stone
for one of yours.

232
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,670
Does this comply with the rules?

233
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,390
No, absolutely not!

234
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,030
Exchanging stones for stones,

235
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,200
there has never been a precedent

236
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,630
at the Gumie Public Auction!

237
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,610
Exchanging goods for goods

238
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,630
is the most basic form of trade.

239
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,900
The Gumie Public Auction
has always emphasized free trade.

240
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,670
What's wrong with
exchanging stones for stones?

241
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,020
That's

242
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,790
ancient times!

243
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,560
You're just making up excuses!

244
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,790
I think you're deliberately stalling.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,960
I don't care what methods you use
behind the scenes,

246
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,390
but exchanging stones for stones
is entirely within the rules!

247
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,040
If you keep messing around,

248
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,250
I'll immediately take a stand
against the judging panel!

249
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,750
Mr. Lu,

250
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,630
forget it.

251
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,150
There's not much time left.

252
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,390
It's better to keep the peace

253
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,790
among the judges.

254
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,230
Listen,

255
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,750
drag this out as much as possible.

256
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,800
Try to stretch it
until the end of the competition.

257
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,990
Understand?

258
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,900
Looking at the cut here,

259
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,390
it really looks good.

260
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,030
However…

261
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,030
Enough talking!

262
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,440
You know exactly

263
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
the value of this raw stone.

264
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,800
I'll only exchange it for this one.

265
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,000
I know someone has told you to stall,

266
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,550
but if you agree to the exchange,

267
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,910
it's yours,

268
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,550
and your profit will be
at least ten million.

269
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,390
If you find a good jade carver,

270
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,870
you could even make fifteen million.

271
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,870
If you don't agree,

272
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll go find someone else.

273
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,920
I don't have time to waste with you.

274
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,760
Wait!

275
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,660
(Gumie Public Auction Rankings)

276
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,670
Due to the exit of contestant Guishou,

277
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,030
the championship will be decided

278
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,270
among the remaining 19 contestants.

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,270
We cut the raw stones

280
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,300
in their current ranking order.

281
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,720
(I hope I didn't bet wrong.)

282
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,030
Contestant Zhang Zhenbei's stones are

283
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,270
Huika Quarry's waxy variety,
colored Huangyanglyu,

284
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,080
and Baishanqiao Quarry's
fine-waxy variety, colored Baidiqing.

285
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,610
Li Jianqian's stones are

286
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,910
Moxisha Quarry's
waxy-ice variety, Tiankonglan,

287
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,690
and Mowanji Quarry's
waxy-ice variety, Laolanshui.

288
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,030
Dong's...

289
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,550
Dong's first raw stone

290
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,630
is Damakan Quarry's icy variety,
colored Fulushou!

291
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,490
- Impressive!
- Great luck!

292
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,870
Dong's victory is a sure thing!

293
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,440
It's great quality!

294
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
That is a fortune!

295
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,910
Shout out to Dong!

296
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,510
Shi Lai has lost.

297
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,270
Grandpa, this is
just the first raw stone.

298
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,790
Stones like these are so rare,

299
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,270
even billions of tons might not

300
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,200
yield one.

301
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,630
This stone alone

302
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,870
is enough to crush the competition.

303
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,390
This rare raw stone

304
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,870
hasn't appeared on the market for a long time.

305
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,990
Dong...

306
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,280
Wait...

307
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,670
Dong's second stone is

308
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,840
Moxisha Quarry's icy variety,
colored Tiankonglan!

309
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,510
Amazing!

310
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,030
Dong really lives up to his reputation!

311
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,100
(Gumie Public Auction Rankings)
It's all premium varieties!

312
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,150
Dong actually got two rare raw stones
in a row!

313
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,320
This is...

314
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,710
What?

315
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
The Qingdi glassy jadeite?!

316
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,870
This is the feeling!

317
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,510
This is what it means
to win the auction championship!

318
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,660
Bravo! Champion!

319
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,440
Incredible!

320
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,280
Playing cool?

321
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,450
Go on.

322
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,550
Let's see how long
you can keep up the act!

323
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,980
(Rank 1: Zhao Dong)
170 million!

324
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,270
The final valuation from the judges

325
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,890
is 170 million!

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,630
This is the highest price ever

327
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,630
in the Gumie Public Auction!

328
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,330
Dong has set a record!

329
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,150
Thank you.

330
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,950
Thank you!

331
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,080
Congratulations, Dong!

332
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,270
Congratulations!

333
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,030
170 million.

334
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,590
Shi Lai,

335
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,030
how are you going to beat him?

336
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,150
I quit!

337
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,030
Aren't you leaving?

338
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,030
The competition isn't over yet.

339
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,510
What are you thinking?

340
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,750
170 million!
How are you going to compare?

341
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,670
You really think you can win?

342
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,320
- Are you crazy?
- I do.

343
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,550
Dreaming!

344
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,840
Lunatic!

345
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,440
Finally, it's Shi Lai's turn

346
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,670
to try and create a miracle
with twenty yuan.

347
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,270
Will he become a legend,

348
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,750
or just a joke?

349
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,150
Let's wait and see!

350
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,790
Do we really need to wait?

351
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,800
There's no way
his stone is worth more than Dong's!
