00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,350
No tears until you see the coffin.

4
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,920
There's always an exception.

5
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,640
Some ivory varieties are used as footstones,

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
but the large ones aren't always poor-quality.

7
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,420
If there's a dark red flaw on the surface...

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,230
They might seem like trash on the outside,

9
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,840
but inside could contain top-quality jade.

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,760
Dragonstone?!

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
No...

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,870
Impossible.

13
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,150
This can't be!

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,480
The most transparent jade I've ever seen!

15
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,200
Master Dai,

16
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,480
is theirs worth more than ours?

17
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,550
The emperor is still in the world,

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,120
but the dragon is mostly unseen.

19
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,640
It actually turned out to be Dragonstone.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
As we all know,

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,400
Dragonstone jade is extremely rare

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,950
and considered a supreme masterpiece.

23
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,360
Its estimated value is

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
fifty million yuan.

25
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,750
Fifty million?

26
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,030
It seems the winner

27
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,560
is already indisputable.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
I announce

29
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,560
Shi Lai as the winner!

30
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,530
Yes!

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,030
Well-deserved!

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,310
Truly impressive!

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,190
Congratulations.

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,560
You…

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,910
Mr. Shi,

36
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,660
who is your teacher?

37
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,220
I have no teacher.

38
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,220
I taught myself.

39
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,380
Impressive.

40
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Truly impressive!

41
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,500
Mr. Lu,

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,880
it's your turn to perform, isn't it?

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,900
Mr. Shi, you really have some skill.

44
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,660
I was impulsive earlier,

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,660
and I apologize.

46
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,540
As for the bet,

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,580
we were just joking,

48
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,340
it doesn't count anymore.

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,020
How come it doesn't count?

50
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,380
You lost the bet.

51
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,340
Didn't you know

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,850
that you should honor your word?

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,380
- I…
- Exactly, we are all witnesses!

54
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,600
Not willing to pay up? Shame on you!

55
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,810
I said stop, don't push it!

56
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,100
Shame on you!

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,060
Shame on you!

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,180
Shame on you!

59
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,280
Shame on you!

60
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,340
Shame on you!

61
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,600
Shame on you!

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
Get lost!

63
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,100
All of you!

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,400
Don't record this!

65
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,820
Stop filming!

66
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,820
Shi Lai,

67
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,690
I'll deal with you later!

68
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,650
Do you know how hard I worked

69
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,380
to get Master Dai there?

70
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,500
Just for his interest in ancient jade,

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,380
the owner of Jade Bar charged me 500,000!

72
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,900
And now you've embarrassed the Lu family!

73
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,060
Brother!

74
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,060
I…

75
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,780
Didn't I tell you to be careful of Shi Lai?

76
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,540
But he's just a country bumpkin,

77
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,140
the lost son of the Lin family!

78
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,220
And

79
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,850
Lin's family is on the decline now!

80
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,420
I underestimated him.

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
Go find out how much the owner of Jade Bar

82
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,820
was paid for Shi Lai's information.

83
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,060
I want to know everything about him,

84
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,550
including his weaknesses!

85
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,900
Yes.

86
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,980
This fire's about to spread.

87
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,540
Mr. Shi,

88
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,380
are you ready?

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,380
Why meddle in this when you're not even

90
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,820
trying to get the Cloud Vision manual?

91
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,940
Do I need to report

92
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,940
my plans to you?

93
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,540
This isn't Xuantian Zibing.

94
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,260
The Cloud Vision technique has been lost.

95
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,780
Grandpa!

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,300
- Miaomiao?
- Can we talk?

97
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,300
Is this a good time?

98
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,180
What do you think?

99
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,380
Good.

100
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,560
What I mean is, it's not a good time!

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,140
Grandpa told me to apologize
to the Lu family.

102
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
Why?

103
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,660
It's your fault!

104
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,220
You offended the Lu family,

105
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,400
and now he's asking me to apologize.

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,220
Isn't it you who offended the Lu family?

107
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,300
Whatever!

108
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,540
I'm upset right now.

109
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,900
Can't you do something to comfort me?

110
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
How about

111
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,780
a cup of hot water?

112
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,540
By the way,

113
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,020
about yesterday's changing room incident…

114
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,900
Don't worry, I don't remember a thing!

115
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,780
You'd better remember.

116
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,940
I didn't finish speaking.

117
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
I want you…

118
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,100
I want you to be my stone appraiser for life.

119
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,540
Young Master!

120
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,140
I'm going to the bathroom.

121
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,260
I don't know how Miaomiao suddenly appeared.

122
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,020
I'll go check on her.

123
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,580
What have I done?!

124
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,420
Miss Linda?

125
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,180
Is it convenient?

126
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,660
Not convenient.

127
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,100
Listen to me first,

128
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,850
then decide whether it's convenient.

129
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,100
Sit.

130
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,540
Well, this is my home, Miss Linda.

131
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,460
Where is my scarf?

132
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,220
I gave it to you. You didn't want it,

133
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,600
and now you want it again…

134
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,260
I changed my mind.

135
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,300
Give it back to me.

136
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,700
You carry it all the time?

137
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,020
Not really.

138
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,860
I have it with me.

139
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,780
It's clean now, it had wine.

140
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,100
No need to wash it this time.

141
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,100
What exactly do you want?”

142
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,580
Someone asked me to buy your information.

143
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,780
Who?

144
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,140
I can't tell you that.

145
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,660
But we can cooperate.

146
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,140
How can we cooperate if you

147
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,100
won't even tell me who it is?

148
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,020
After we cooperate, you'll naturally know.

149
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,540
He wants to know your background, experiences,

150
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,660
likes, and weaknesses.

151
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,900
If you're willing,

152
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,200
you can tell me everything,

153
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,250
and I'll sell it for you.

154
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,900
We'll split the profits 70/30.

155
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,100
It's a risk-free deal,

156
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,660
very profitable.

157
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,220
Plus, you get to decide what's true

158
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,220
and what's false.

159
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
Miss Linda?

160
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,340
Miaomiao, she and I…

161
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
No need to explain.

162
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,800
With your talents,

163
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,940
it's up to you whom you work with

164
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,780
as a stone appraiser.

165
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,780
Exactly.

166
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,660
As long as the price is right,

167
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,100
anyone can be a partner,

168
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,500
right,

169
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,580
Mr. Shi?

170
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,380
What you two are talking about is different.

171
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,670
- Don't speak!
- Don't speak!

172
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,020
Qiao Na, are you tired?

173
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,860
Do you need rest?

174
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm not tired, Young Master.

175
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,260
I'm tired. Is that okay?

176
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,420
There are thieves in the house! Run!

177
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,260
I'll hold them off!

178
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,540
I'll fight them!

179
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,740
Come on!

180
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,860
Let's go!

181
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,820
This isn't over!

182
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,980
Incredible!

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,980
That move was incredible!

184
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,580
What's wrong, Linda?

185
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
Are you injured?

186
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,140
- Oh my…
- Stop the bleeding first!

187
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,060
Right, right!

188
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,620
Remember,

189
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,140
this wound was for you.

190
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,140
I'm injured too.

191
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
How can I not see that?

192
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,660
Bruises. You can't see it yet,

193
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
but it hurts.

194
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,620
Come on, she's bleeding.

195
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,300
That's just a superficial injury!

196
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,140
Mine's internal!

197
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,620
- But…
- I'm fine.

198
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,900
Just take care of her.

199
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,500
Let me check.

200
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,780
Qiao Na, why don't you…

201
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,620
Are you okay?

202
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,380
What happened to you?

203
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,860
You're injured!

204
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,260
Qiao Na.

205
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,140
Hang in there.

206
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,780
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

207
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,620
I'm sorry!

208
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Let them do it.

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,260
