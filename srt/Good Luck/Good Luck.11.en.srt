00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,750
Has he lost his mind?

4
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,320
How dare he cut it like that?

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,160
Yeah!

6
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,400
What if that cut
ruins the whole raw stone?

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,790
It'll be wasted!

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,430
Perfectly uniform green?

9
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,430
It's perfectly uniform green!

10
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,840
So perfectly uniform!

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,680
What a perfect color!

12
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,950
This guy is impressive!

13
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,820
Both raw stones

14
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,200
aren't particularly high quality,

15
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,800
but based on the result of the cut,

16
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,050
Shi Lai wins.

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,840
(Looks like I underestimated him.)

18
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,760
(Don't get too cocky though.)

19
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,230
(I'll make sure)

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,680
(you're utterly defeated next!)

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,690
(Round 3 - Fake)
The third round is called "Fake."

22
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,970
The contestants will have 10 minutes

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,200
to identify all the fake raw stones

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,560
among a pile of stones.

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,000
The one who finds the most wins.

26
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,470
Time's up.

27
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,520
Shi Lai has identified two fake stones,

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,710
one with artificial outer skin
and one dyed stone.

29
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,400
Master Zhou seems
to have found two as well.

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,770
(Looks like this round is a draw.)

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,630
It's a pity that
Master Zhou is two rounds behind.

32
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,190
If he loses this round too,

33
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,750
I'm afraid...

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,400
Three?

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,150
Master Zhou found three!

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,370
Old tricks are the best.

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,470
Master Zhou is indeed the superior one.

38
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,470
Impossible!

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,750
How did that stone split into two?

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,870
Master Zhou found three fake stones.

41
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,520
This round's winner

42
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,760
is Master Zhou.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,280
How did he manage

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,710
to split that raw stone in two?

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,800
(I didn't split the raw stone.)

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,360
(I simply found one)

47
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,750
(that was already split.)

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,750
The crack looks like it was already there.

49
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,020
(Round 4 - Touch)

50
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,000
The fourth round is the "Touch" round.

51
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,710
The contestants can only touch

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,710
the surface of the raw stone,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
without lifting

54
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,900
or using any tools.

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
The one with the more valuable stone wins.

56
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,560
Wulanhai Jade.

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,380
Data analysis ongoing.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,680
Data analysis ongoing.

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,430
Wulanhai Jade.

60
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,630
From the Wulanhai region.

61
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,280
Weighs 4.8 kg.

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,450
The bottom has cracks,

63
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,190
indicating it's already damaged.

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,280
The probability of it containing
premium jade is zero.

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,430
Recommend discarding.

66
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,580
Recommend discarding.

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,430
I choose this one.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960
Kid,

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,920
I advise you to pick a different stone.

70
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,720
This one has

71
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,560
a rough,

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
dry skin

73
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,560
that isn't tight at all.

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
Anyone with a keen eye would notice

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,070
the cracks inside.

76
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,110
No need to change.

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,130
You'll only know if it has cracks

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,290
once it's cut open.

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,070
It's really beautiful!

80
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,950
Master Zhou's stone

81
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,430
is white glassy jadeite,

82
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,160
pure and flawless,

83
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,620
like snow on a mountain peak.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,460
A true gem!

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,050
Thank you.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,270
Master Zhou is amazing!

87
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,570
I knew it!

88
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,830
He's a real master!

89
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,000
He's incredible!

90
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,600
Look at its color…

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,150
It's Wulanhai Jade!

92
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,040
Wulanhai Jade's raw stone resources

93
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,120
are nearly exhausted now.

94
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,040
Only a few can still be found.

95
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,150
So precious?

96
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,950
Does that mean Shi Lai is winning?

97
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,190
It is indeed Wulanhai Jade,

98
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,000
but unfortunately,

99
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,160
the jade has many tiny black dots inside.

100
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,760
It's a waste stone.

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
How come?

102
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,480
Based on its appearance,

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
it can't possibly be waste.

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,660
Wulanhai Jade

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,600
naturally has many black dots
on the surface,

106
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,790
making internal flaws harder to detect.

107
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,870
Maybe you misjudged it.

108
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,210
Master Zhou

109
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,270
wins this round.

110
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,320
Thank you!

111
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
Thank you!

112
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,430
As expected of Master Zhou!

113
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,830
Shout out to Master Zhou!

114
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,660
You see, one

115
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,440
can't defy the heavens.

116
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,430
The same crack?

117
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,390
Zhou Tong, you cheated!

118
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,070
You mixed a tampered raw stone

119
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,810
into the competition,

120
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,010
then scanned it with the ring
you're wearing.

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,130
If I'm not mistaken,

122
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,360
someone else

123
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,980
also transmitted AI analysis data to you.

124
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,950
Do you have proof?

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,500
Or are you

126
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,920
just making excuses

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,270
for losing the competition?

128
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,500
Everyone,

129
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,000
this kid is talking about AI,

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,670
something I've never even heard of!

131
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,800
- Yeah, this is nonsense!
- How could he say that?

132
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Shi Lai,

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
cracks in raw stones are common.

134
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,710
Master Nine,

135
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,430
since both sides have their claims,

136
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,960
it won't hurt
to check Master Zhou Tong's ring.

137
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,150
Sure!

138
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,190
Miss Linda,

139
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
please clear my name.

140
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Scanning complete,

141
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,300
everything is normal.

142
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,270
No issues.

143
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,910
Zhou Tong,

144
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,940
you secretly swapped the rings.

145
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
Enough.

146
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,940
You represent the Lin family.

147
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,680
Don't let everyone look down on you.

148
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,070
Kid,

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,860
you actually noticed something was wrong
with my ring.

150
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,870
There's some skill in you.

151
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,650
But what's the point?

152
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,800
Back in the day,

153
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
your grandfather had to beg

154
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,830
like a little puppy

155
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,630
in front of me,

156
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,930
wagging his tail.

157
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,000
Grandpa!

158
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Shi Lai,

159
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,210
stone gambling is filled
with uncertainties.

160
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,380
Every expert has their tricks.

161
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,240
Playing a few dirty tricks
is just routine.

162
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,500
If you can't overcome
such a small setback,

163
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,770
you shouldn't even think about
entering the tiger's den of Gumie!

164
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,550
Shi Lai,

165
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,150
will you continue?

166
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
I'll continue.

167
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,970
(Round 5)
The final round is "Guess."

168
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,380
(Guess)
Each contestant

169
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,720
has a raw stone in front of them.

170
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,550
Half of it has been removed,

171
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,390
and they must guess
the original value of the stone

172
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,000
based on the remaining half.

173
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,600
The one who guesses the higher value wins.

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,120
A genius, huh?

175
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,670
I haven't stomped a genius underfoot
in so long.

176
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,870
Just thinking about it excites me!

177
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,750
Are you ready?

178
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
(Grandpa,)

179
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,630
(I must win!)

180
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
I choose this one.

181
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,440
Why did he pick that one?

182
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,030
It's full of cracks.

183
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,480
He's giving up, isn't he?

184
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,550
Bring over the corresponding halves
of the raw stones.

185
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,720
(Shi Lai,)

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,200
(you'll never guess.)

187
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,240
(I already knew the prices
of the other halves.)

188
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,650
(You've already lost.)

189
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,200
Could Master Zhou's

190
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,360
stone be…

191
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
the Inky Green?

192
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
That's right.

193
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Master Zhou's raw stone
is indeed the Inky Green.

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,590
Its price has increased tenfold

195
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,010
in the past decade,

196
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,750
and it's still rising.

197
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,440
This one has excellent
texture and transparency.

198
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,940
It's worth at least ten million yuan!

199
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,150
Ten million?

200
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,270
Looks like the winner is already decided!

201
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
The raw stone Shi Lai chose

202
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,610
is just waste.

203
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,770
It's worthless.

204
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,240
This kid has lost for sure!

205
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,150
I told you, how could Master Zhou
lose to some unknown kid?

206
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,960
That's right, Master Zhou
is definitely going to win!

207
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,790
I announce that

208
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,170
the final winner

209
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,650
of this competition is…

210
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,630
Master Zhou!

211
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,470
- Master…
- Wait!

212
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,120
It's this spot!

213
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,870
Is he smashing the stone?

214
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,360
What's he trying to do?

215
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,600
Has he lost his mind?

216
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,030
What is he doing?

217
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,550
Is he out of his mind?

218
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,670
A certain type of raw stone

219
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,360
may seem to have obvious
fly-wing-like cracks on the surface,

220
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,440
known in the industry as rough texture.

221
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,080
But it's actually a stone pattern.

222
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,480
The interior of such stones is loose

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,750
and arrayed like a formation,

224
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,080
concealing a treasure.

225
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,600
If you break through the focal point,

226
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,140
you'll find a gem.
