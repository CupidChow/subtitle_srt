00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,320
Lu Jingzhao, what are you doing?

4
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,200
You've completely ruined
the Gu family's reputation,

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,670
especially on such a significant day.

6
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,320
(Never mind,
I'll just get through this first.)

7
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,480
Consider this my free help for Mr. Shi.

8
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,350
The information is in this scroll.

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,470
Do you think you're a strategist?

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
I don't need it.

11
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,760
Of course, if you have any concerns,

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,280
you don't have to open it.

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
My good intentions

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
are already given.

15
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,820
(Shout "I'm a fool" three times,
and I'll solve everything for you.)

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,120
Shi Lai, what's going on?

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,200
What do you think?

18
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,040
He's utterly embarrassed.

19
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,630
Security,

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,150
throw him out!

21
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm a fool! I'm a fool! I'm a fool!

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,310
He has a mental illness?

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,640
Are you out of your mind?

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,790
Come over here!

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,950
This guy

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,080
has gone mad!

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,920
Get out of the Gu family!

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
(Are you crazy?)

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,470
(You might be good at stone gambling,)

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,150
(but I'm an expert)

31
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,400
(in understanding human nature.)

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,030
Isn't this Mr. Lu Jingzhao?

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,150
Yeah, that's him.

34
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,310
Remember,

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,240
make sure you film everything.

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,680
I want him discredited

37
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,750
in all of Yongjing.

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,430
I can't believe

39
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,430
the Lu family would stoop
to using such tactics!

40
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,630
They're so manipulative!

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,800
Lu Jingzhao,

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
anything else to say?

43
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,710
No.

44
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,870
No!

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
This is all slander!

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,240
Your video must be fake!

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Is your video real then?

48
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,920
Just get out already!

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,910
You're embarrassing yourself!

50
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,120
Yeah, this is ridiculous!

51
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,050
This is pure slander!

52
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,990
The second son of the Lu family
would do something like this!

53
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,710
So shameless!

54
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,550
Slandering others!

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Kneel!

56
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,470
Brother!

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
He deserves it!

58
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,400
Exactly! He should've been kicked out
long ago!

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
Master Nine,

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
Mr. Shi,

61
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,120
it's my fault for not disciplining
my younger brother,

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,120
which led to this disgraceful behavior.

63
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,080
It's truly a shame for the Lu family.

64
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,710
Brother!

65
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,120
You're a disgrace!

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,310
Get out of here right now!

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,920
Shi Lai,

68
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,520
this isn't over.

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Mr. Shi,

70
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm so sorry.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,190
(A smart move to save face.)

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,900
Don't say that, Mr. Lu.

73
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,840
It's not your fault,

74
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,580
so no need to apologize.

75
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,910
You really are generous.

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,710
The scene got a bit out of hand,

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,380
but I'll definitely visit you
to apologize later.

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,870
I'm sorry, Master Nine,

79
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,120
I've spoiled your mood.

80
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,000
You have some ability, kid.

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,600
I wasn't wrong about you.

82
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,270
You flatter me.

83
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,600
You want the official
stone appraiser certification, right?

84
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,950
As long as you pass the written test…

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,830
Master Zhou Tong?

86
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,750
Isn't he the most famous
stone appraiser in Yongjing?

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,400
I've heard he comes from
a family of appraisers

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,680
and has been in the business
for almost 40 years without losing a case.

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,190
But he's known to be eccentric

90
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,560
and doesn't interact much with people.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
- Didn't expect him to be here today.
- You don't say.

92
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
Master Zhou is well-known

93
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,040
and also the chief appraiser
of the Jade Society.

94
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Perhaps,

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,480
he's here because of
Master Lin Jiang's grandson.

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,950
So that's Master Zhou Tong.

97
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,430
The Jade Society Stone Appraiser Exam
results are out!

98
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,600
- The new rising star in the jade world...
- 33 points.

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,680
(Appraiser Exam)
...came last.

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,750
Lin Jiang's grandson only scored

101
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,040
33 points!

102
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
What a joke!

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,430
Yeah, so embarrassing!

104
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,750
What a disgrace to Master Lin's name!

105
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,920
He's trash.

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,490
The biggest joke
in the stone appraising world!

107
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,600
He really is trash.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
Master Nine,

109
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,680
please give me another chance.

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,520
Alright,

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
since

112
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,950
Master Zhou Tong,
the chief appraiser of Yongjing,

113
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,000
is here,

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,160
let's have a
raw stone appraisal competition.

115
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,480
If you win,

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the certification

117
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,270
is yours.

118
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,640
Otherwise,

119
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,190
the Jade Society will never certify you.

120
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,510
Do you dare to compete?

121
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,480
Alright, how do we compete?

122
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,350
Shi Lai.

123
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Trust me.

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,600
Master Zhou Tong, what do you say?

125
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,190
I was here just for fun,

126
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,510
but now you want me to work?

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,360
I've heard of your fame,

128
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,630
and seeing you today,

129
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,560
you truly live up to it.

130
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,120
This is too far from me.

131
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,800
If I could have the honor
of competing with you

132
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,270
and learning from you,

133
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,240
it would truly be
a life-changing experience for me.

134
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,870
Cut the formalities, don't be so poetic.

135
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
You're

136
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
a rising genius;

137
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,000
no need to be so humble.

138
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,920
I prefer to see your

139
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,630
wild side.

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
You flatter me.

141
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,830
What I mean is,

142
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,870
dealing with someone like you

143
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,510
won't be free.

144
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,830
You're Lin Jiang's grandson, right?

145
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,400
Yes.

146
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,600
Even your grandfather

147
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,730
might not have been able to beat me.

148
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,800
How much can you have learned from him?

149
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,830
You're right.

150
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
I'll learn from you today.

151
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,560
On behalf of Master Nine,

152
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,800
I'll host today's competition.

153
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,720
It will be five rounds,

154
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,680
best of three.

155
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,680
The rounds will test different aspects:
identification, cutting, feeling, faking,

156
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
and guessing.

157
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,630
These are the skills the Jade Society uses

158
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,480
to assess an appraiser's overall abilities.

159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
To ensure fairness,

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
Master Nine

161
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,480
will act as the judge.

162
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,830
The first round is identification.

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,310
These are all Hetian jade rough stones.

164
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,790
Each of you

165
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,270
will choose one,

166
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,240
and whoever picks the higher value

167
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,320
wins.

168
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,430
(Shi Lai has always appraised jadeite,)

169
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,070
(but I wonder
if he understands Hetian jade?)

170
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,240
Master Zhou is an expert
in Hetian jade identification.

171
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,040
Shi Lai will definitely
lose the first round.

172
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,830
You have five minutes

173
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,680
to pick your stones.

174
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,630
The competition begins now!

175
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,630
Gentlemen, please.

176
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,500
(Round 1 - Identification)

177
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,480
Time's up.

178
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,750
Now, cut the two stones.

179
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,720
Shi Lai clearly picked his stone
based on Master Zhou's,

180
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,200
since the size and color
are almost identical.

181
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,360
He's just copying Master Zhou.

182
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,320
There's no way he can beat him.

183
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,440
He can't beat him at all.

184
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,600
Master Zhou's stone has
light-colored autumn pear skin,

185
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
golden

186
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,360
and elegant,

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,750
with a delicate texture—

188
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,080
truly

189
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,670
a top-tier stone.

190
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,270
Impressive!

191
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,750
Master Nine, you flatter me!

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,300
There's no suspense here!

193
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,200
As expected from Master Zhou,

194
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,210
he won the first round easily.

195
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,160
Shi Lai's sure to lose!

196
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,750
Shi Lai's stone is darker

197
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,360
with more spots,

198
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,550
and it has

199
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,630
rare watergrass inclusions

200
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,870
that resemble autumn pear skin blemishes.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,480
From a collector's perspective,

202
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,590
Shi Lai's stone is much more unique,

203
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,310
with higher ornamental value.

204
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,390
First round,

205
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,560
Shi Lai wins.

206
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,600
Didn't expect this kid to actually win!

207
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,510
He didn't just guess, did he?

208
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,980
(Round 2 - Cutting)

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,550
One cut makes you rich,

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
one cut bankrupts you.

211
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,240
The second round

212
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
is cutting.

213
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
You'll each choose a place

214
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,550
to cut your rough stone,

215
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,000
and the result will be determined
by the cut.

216
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,550
(This is a fish scale window,)

217
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,030
(which could be a trap window.)

218
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,440
(It looks clear,)

219
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
(but it might have been tampered with.)

220
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,110
(I'd better)

221
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,270
(be cautious.)

222
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,710
Cut.

223
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,510
Full green.

224
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,150
Is he still pretending?

225
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,000
He's no match for Master Zhou!

226
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,390
(This looks like a typical flower window,)

227
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,320
(but it's actually a trap window)

228
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,320
(with a small opening)

229
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,720
(and tricky placement.)

230
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,550
(It's quite misleading.)

231
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,840
(What should I do?)

232
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,870
How long has it been?

233
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,480
I think he's just stalling.

234
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,320
Yeah!

235
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,960
He has no skills, yet he's boasting.

236
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,790
He's embarrassing the Lin family!

237
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,750
What's wrong?

238
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,840
Are you scared?

239
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,030
Shi Lai, do you want to take a break?

240
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,840
Miss Gu, if you're worried
about your boyfriend,

241
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,840
you should just let him admit defeat,

242
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,080
then I can go back

243
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,920
and rest.

244
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,630
But this money

245
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,200
is too easy for me to earn.

246
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,770
Master Nine has been too generous.

247
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,270
Just admit defeat!

248
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,750
(From the surface green,)

249
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,030
(this is most likely from the Huika site…)

250
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,030
(a skin green.)

251
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,150
Skin green is a type of green

252
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,790
that grows on the surface of jade,

253
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,150
and it's one of the riskiest forms.

254
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,790
The "immortal-cutting green"

255
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,200
is another form of skin green.

256
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,440
The owner of the rough stone
often cuts it through the green streaks

257
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,910
to show the green in the middle,

258
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,030
creating two full green faces.

259
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,870
People praise this
for its precision and skill,

260
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,750
calling it immortal-cutting green.

261
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,960
(At Huika,)

262
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,840
(skin)

263
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
(and floating colors)

264
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,080
(are common.)

265
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,930
(Many people mistakenly think
green skin is full color,)

266
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,260
(but when cut,)

267
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,620
(it often just reveals
a thin transitional layer)

268
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,630
(or white-bottomed green.)

269
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,010
(Since it's just one cut,)

270
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,630
(I'll bet it all on this one.)
