12
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,640
I originally planned
to use your real identity

13
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,510
to make Shi Lai collapse

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
and break his mental defenses.

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,650
I thought

16
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,430
it would take more effort,

17
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,400
but

You're a smart person.

22
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,080
Do you really want to oppose me

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,630
for a useless man?

24
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,240
You're my most capable assistant.

25
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,150
I'll give you a choice.

26
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,000
You'd better

27
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,470
not disappoint me again.

28

33
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,800

Linda,

35
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,890
are you here to kill me?

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,120
Wait another ten minutes.

37
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,390
If she doesn't act,

38
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,190
kill them both.

Actually,

41
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,680
I've always been a subordinate of Guilao.

42
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
I guessed it.

43
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,040
How's Miaomiao?

44
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,450
She's out of life-threatening danger now.

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,070
That's good.

46
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,310
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,000
It's okay, Linda.

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
I'm just grateful

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,430
that you came to send me off.

50
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,670
Shi Lai,

51
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,830
I can save you.

52
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,430
Forget it, Linda.

53
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,040
You can't save me.

54
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,390
Guilao is paranoid,

55
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,750
and if you hesitate
when it's time to act,

56
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,920
you'll be in danger too.

57
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,430
Shi Lai,

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,070
you're really too foolish.

59
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,580
I've been lying to you the entire time!

60
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,750
Let it be.

61
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,160
Besides,

62
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,480
you haven't always been lying to me,

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
have you?

64
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,400

65
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000

66

there's something
I've been hiding from you.

67
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,870
Don't touch me!

68
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,070

69
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,510

77
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
after this,

78
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,910
you'll mature a lot.

only cut open by those

then we'll be one family,

106

He and I are now in-laws,

to kneel like this.
