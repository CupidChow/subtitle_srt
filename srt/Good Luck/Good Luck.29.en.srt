00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,460
=Episode 29=

3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,680
Master Nine,

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,070
you forgot something.

5
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,390
What is it?

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,470
You can see everything,

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,840
but

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,390
they can't.

9
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,270
Oh, God!

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,790
This jade is so pure!

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,960
And there isn't a single crack!

12
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,510
This green is so deep and vibrant.

13
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,040
It's very likely that
the green extends all the way down,

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,870
which means a massive amount of green!

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,230
The price will definitely skyrocket!

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,000
I didn't expect such green

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,040
inside the stone!

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,840
It's going up! It's a win!

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,110
It's rising!

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,580
It's rising!

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,590
Stone gambling is about imagination.

22
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,280
That's a saying Grandpa left for me.

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,230
Only recently did I finally understand

24
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,400
what it really means.

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,710
You all don't understand!

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,180
You can't just look at
that little bit of color!

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,200
Just that little bit!

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,040
There's no green beneath! It's worthless!

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,690
Especially since it's been cut in half,

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,150
the only valuable green

31
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,910
is all ruined!

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,280
You don't get it!

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,140
It's rising!

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Master Nine, continue cutting.

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,200
Even if you have the Cloud Vision Skill,

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,650
you're still no match for me.

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,750
Even less so compared to my grandpa.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,590
One cut makes you rich,
another cut can bankrupt you!

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,190
(There's only that little color.)

40
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,470
(No matter how I cut it,
the price will definitely crash.)

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,430
Do you remember what I told you?

42
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,630
The Cloud Vision Skill has a flaw.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,430
Didn't you notice

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,430
the crack in the small black stone?

45
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,190
(Could it be…)

46
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,030
(the Cloud Vision Skill
really has a flaw?)

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,800
(Wait a second.)

48
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,360
(What is that expression?)

49
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,000
(I see it now!)

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,630
(That vile little brat)

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,560
(has been trying to mess with
my mind all along,)

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,870
(trying to make me overlook this crack.)

53
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,960
(Yes,)

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,430
(that look!)

55
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,280
(You've noticed the crack too.)

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,680
(But it's not deep at all.)

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,710
(One more cut)

58
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,870
(and it'll be completely gone.)

59
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,120
(What a pity!)

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,960
(You're still not skilled enough!)

61
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,490
Cut!

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,100
Master Nine, looks like
you noticed it after all.

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
All your scheming,

64
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,240
I saw right through it.

65
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,400
As expected of the Cloud Vision Skill!

66
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,680
With it, you can see
every tiny clue clearly.

67
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,150
Ridiculous!

68
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,740
After all these years,

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,680
you still don't understand
the power of the Cloud Vision Skill.

70
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,310
On the contrary,

71
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,310
I understand it all too well.

72
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,120
- What do you mean?
- That's why

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,000
I know its biggest flaw.

74
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,410
That cut wasn't impressive at all!

75
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,600
We thought that green would extend,

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,870
but it's just this tiny bit.

77
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,210
Yeah,

78
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,720
looking at how transparent it is,

79
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,440
we thought there would be
a large patch of it beneath.

80
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,390
Just a little bit?

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,250
One cut makes you rich,
another cut can bankrupt you!

82
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,390
The price just crashed!

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,130
What's happening?

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,050
The crack is gone!

85
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
The green's gone!

86
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,070
Stone gambling is about imagination.

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
You only know it's about
gambling with people's hearts.

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,630
But what my grandpa

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,430
truly understood was what people's hearts

90
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,390
really want.

91
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,720
Impossible!

92
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,950
How could I lose?

93
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,120
How could I ever lose?

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Clear the scene!

95
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,150
Clear the scene!

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,290
What, can't handle losing?

97
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,070
Everyone, immediately leave the venue!

98
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,880
Get out!

99
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,830
You think you've won just like that?

100
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,510
You're still so naive,

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,680
overestimating yourself!

102
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,710
Even if you win,

103
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,720
Xuantian Zibing stone

104
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,230
is still mine to cut!

105
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,240
I'm a fool! I'm a fool! I'm a fool!

106
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,510
Look! Look!

107
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,390
Everyone, look!

108
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,950
Isn't that Master Lin Jiang?

109
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,360
Master Nine imprisoned him!

110
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,240
What is going on?!

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,160
So Guilao is Master Nine!

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
- Stop filming!
- I never expected this!

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,600
He's so cruel!

114
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,630
Brother! Look!

115
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,600
Master Nine is finished!

116
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,350
Hurry!

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,560
Shut off the screen! Hurry!

118
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,270
Why?

119
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,680
Master Nine is Guilao,

120
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,350
and he's involved in money laundering.

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,870
He can't do anything to us anymore!

122
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,390
Stupid! We're in the same boat as him!

123
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,270
If he's done for,
he'll drag us down with him!

124
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,110
Hurry up!

125
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,730
Okay, okay!

126
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Stop filming!

127
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,270
Stop filming! Stop it!

128
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,270
Put your phone down! Down!

129
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,560
Don't film me! Down!

130
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,400
Don't film me!

131
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,440
Don't film me! Stop…!

132
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,010
(Grandpa,)

133
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,750
(I know you wanted me to live happily,)

134
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,620
(but if I don't take revenge for this,)

135
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,190
(I won't be happy!)

136
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,910
Master Nine,

137
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,720
it's over.

138
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,900
Over?

139
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,120
I haven't even cut Xuantian Zibing stone yet!

140
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
How could it be over?

141
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,630
So what if you cut Xuantian Zibing stone?

142
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,190
So what if you become
the world's number one stone appraiser?

143
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,190
All you've done,

144
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
the only thing waiting for you

145
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,430
is a prison sentence.

146
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,510
The legend of Xuantian Zibing stone

147
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,560
has cost so many people

148
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,240
such a high price.

149
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,870
Take your dirty hands off!

150
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,850
What? Is he hitting people now?

151
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,990
What does Master Nine want to do?

152
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,720
Don't think that
just because you've ruined me,

153
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,270
you're qualified
to touch Xuantian Zibing stone!

154
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,350
The only one who can cut Xuantian Zibing stone

155
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,120
is me!

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,360
No one else is worthy!

157
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,390
No one!

158
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Xuantian Zibing stone

159
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,830
is mine.

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
(Grandpa...)

161
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,150
Cut it!

162
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,670
Cut it!

163
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
No matter what,

164
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,800
I want everyone to know that

165
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,480
it's me, Master Nine,
who cut Xuantian Zibing stone!

166
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,510
Cut!

167
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Shi Lai,

168
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,870
watch closely for your grandfather.

169
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,910
This is Xuantian Zibing stone!

170
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,480
I am the world's number one
stone appraiser!

171
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,910
Shi Lai,

172
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,360
Xuantian Zibing stone…

173
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,320
has reappeared in the world!

174
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,630
That's just raw stone waste, isn't it?

175
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,960
There's nothing inside!

176
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,710
Yeah!

177
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,990
Is that really Xuantian Zibing stone?

178
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,870
Impossible…

179
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
Impossible!

180
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,390
Impossible!

181
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,750
I saw it!

182
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,270
It was there! It was there!

183
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,110
Grandpa!

184
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,160
- Grandpa!
- I...

185
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,470
Grandpa!

186
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,600
I clearly saw it!

187
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,240
I clearly saw it!

188
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,630
Linda,

189
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,850
- Impossible!
- have you ever seen Xuantian Zibing stone?

190
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,040
No.

191
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,750
No one has ever seen it.

192
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,360
That's the legendary top jade.

193
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,920
Yes.

194
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,840
The legendary…

195
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,880
Grandpa!

196
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,030
- Impossible! Impossible!
- Grandpa!

197
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,240
I clearly saw it!

198
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,100
It was there! Where did it go?!

199
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,050
Cut! Cut one more time!

200
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,670
There's nothing inside.

201
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,600
It's just raw stone waste.

202
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,050
Get lost!

203
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,430
Xuantian Zibing stone...

204
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,910
Where is it?

205
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,230
Where is it?!

206
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,820
It must be your doing!

207
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,350
Give me back Xuantian Zibing stone!

208
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,620
Give me back Xuantian Zibing stone!

209
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,560
Where is my Xuantian Zibing stone?

210
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,360
I see now.

211
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,550
There's a special magnetic field
in Xuantian Zibing stone that interferes

212
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,320
with the magnetic field
of the small black stone,

213
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,750
so…

214
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,590
Master Nine,

215
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,550
what you saw

216
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,150
was just an illusion
caused by the magnetic interference.

217
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,120
No, it's not an illusion!

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,150
It was there!

219
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,600
It's impossible that it's an illusion!

220
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,750
The Cloud Vision Skill

221
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,600
lets you see things
ordinary people can't see,

222
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,720
but that's also its biggest flaw.

223
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,750
What you saw may not actually exist.

224
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Because of this small window,

225
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,120
everyone expected it,

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,910
thinking there would be

227
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,630
more stunning colors beneath.

228
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,600
But in reality…

229
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,630
It's just human imagination.

230
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,200
What Cloud Vision Skill?

231
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,270
What Xuantian Zibing stone?

232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,240
It's all empty.

233
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,150
Perhaps

234
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,840
only when a person is truly blind,

235
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,910
can they finally see the world clearly.

236
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,590
Shi Lai,

237
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,960
you can't keep going like this.

238
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,030
I'm fine like this.

239
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,030
You're just wasting away like this!

240
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,320
How is this fine?

241
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,480
Because…

242
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,320
it can't get worse than this.

243
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Shi Lai...

244
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,750
how did you become like this?

245
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,470
I'm done for.

246
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,630
I'm done for, Linda.

247
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
I've lost the Cloud Vision Skill.

248
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,200
I've become a blind man.

249
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,960
What else do you want from me?

250
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,790
Young Master,
it's time for your medicine.

251
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,550
We still have the Lotus Jade,

252
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,990
it's good for improving eyesight.

253
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,870
Let's treat your eyes soon.

254
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,600
What's the use of fixing it?!

255
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,900
I've lost the Cloud Vision Skill!

256
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,020
I have nothing left!

257
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,870
Nothing left!

258
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,360
Don't tell me that
without the Cloud Vision Skill,

259
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,510
you're nothing!

260
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,510
At least the person I knew
wasn't like this!

261
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,150
Don't forget, you're still alive!

262
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,670
Your grandfather,

263
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,670
Gu Yunmiao,

264
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,510
and I…

265
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,910
we sacrificed so much to save you!

266
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,670
It wasn't to see you
live like a dead person!

267
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,720
Master Nine,

268
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,950
by the way, I should tell you,

269
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,040
my eyesight hasn't recovered.

270
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,960
Master Nine is at your three o'clock.

271
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,360
Take two steps forward.

272
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,030
In the end,

273
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,550
you lost to a blind man.

274
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,600
Right, right!

275
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,880
Blind...

276
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,080
Blind! Let me go blind!

277
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,870
