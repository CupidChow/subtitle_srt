=Episode 2=

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,300
Secretary Qiao,
the private detective has confirmed

4
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,500
that Young Master is on Jade Street.

5
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,280
Get that kid for me!

6
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,770
You little rascal!

7
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,940
(Qiao Na, Lin Group's Bodyguard)

8
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,790
Young lad.

9
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,710
What's catching your eye?

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,710
Young Master, are you alright?

11
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,550
Hurry up.

12
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,250
You've overestimated yourselves.

13
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,710
Young Master.

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,870
Let's go home.

15
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,990
Greetings, Young Master.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,500
Greetings, Young Master!

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Hello, beauty.

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,630
Did you mistake me for someone else?

19
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
I know it's hard to believe.

20
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
But I've thoroughly investigated.

21
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,310
You

22
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,310
are the Master's grandson.

23
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,590
Are you sure it's me?

24
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,800
The baby's face is hidden.

25
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,310
Trust me.

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,630
When you went missing,

27
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,750
the Master used
every resource to find you.

28
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,800
It wasn't until recently

29
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,280
that we finally heard about you.

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,870
I can't make sense of it.

31
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,170
(Kinship probability 95.93%)
As long as you can read this.

32
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,560
So, who is your Master?

33
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,710
Kid,

34
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,310
you've finally come back.

35
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
These

36
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,710
are all prepared for you.

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Our Master

38
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,240
is Mr. Lin, a leading figure

39
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,800
in Yongjing's stone appraisal circle.

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,990
His name is Lin Jiang.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,360
Our Master has been
in the raw stone business.

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,520
He occupies one-third
of Yongjing's market

43
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,700
and has amassed
hundreds of millions of assets.

44
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,800
(Young Master is back)

45
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,080
- Here we are.
- Young Master is back.

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,870
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

47
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,240
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

48
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,540
(Young Master is back)

49
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,150
Look, this is Lin Jiang's grandson.

50
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,840
Our contract can be saved now.

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,190
We need to ask them for money.

52
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,120
Pay back the money.

53
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Pay back the money!

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Catch him.

55
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,750
Pay back the money.

56
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,240
Pay back the money!

57
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,630
(Young Master is back)
Pay back the money.

58
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,040
(Pay now)

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,500
Pay now.

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
(Young Master is back. Pay now.
Debts must be settled.)

61
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Pay back the money.

62
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,120
Pay back the money!

63
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,560
Is this what they call
a billionaire debtor?

64
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,220
Actually,

65
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,990
the Master has been missing
for three months.

66
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,600
We've reported it to the police.

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,270
But no one knows his whereabouts.

68
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,750
There's no news about him at all.

69
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,040
We have no right to
use the Master's assets.

70
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,250
That's why

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,560
we ended up like this.

72
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,160
Why didn't you say so earlier?

73
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,580
(Jade Society)

74
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,780
(Vice President, President)

75
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,860
(Five Million Yuan)

76
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,990
(Lu Jinghui, CEO of the Lu Group)
The Supervisor Lin Jiang went missing.

77
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,120
(Secretary General of Jade Society)

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,200
What should we do next?

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,240
(Zhao Jinmo, Vice President of Jade Society)
What do you mean?

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,050
Do we have to be watched over
by a supervisor?

81
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,920
Isn't it fine as it is now?

82
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,000
Lin Jiang

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,820
(Liu Deyu, President of Jade Society)
acquires

84
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,800
the Cloud Vision skill.

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,190
He managed to make his family

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,070
one of the four major families
in stone appraisal.

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,000
But he's quite stubborn.

88
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,560
Intimidating him doesn't work.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,900
Thankfully, all these years,

90
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,560
he's been focused on
finding his grandson.

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,190
He's got no time to investigate us.

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,510
But how did he just disappear suddenly?

93
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,470
Yeah.

94
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,070
How did he vanish all of a sudden?

95
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,310
Read the Stone Appraisal Manual
when you get back.

96
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,430
Young lad.

97
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,630
Three months ago,

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
Master received a message.

99
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,510
He had to go to Gumie City
for a secret event.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
And he never returned after that.

101
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,920
We've tried everything to find him.

102
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,800
But there isn't a single lead.

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,430
(How many children
go missing each year?)

104
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,560
Everyone's saying

105
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,680
that he's likely facing grave danger.

106
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
But I don't think

107
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,240
it's that simple.

108
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,070
This is the Master's safe.

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
He once mentioned

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,520
that no one but him

111
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
and his grandson could open it.

112
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,100
(Cashier's check: Five Million Yuan)

113
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,720
Let's settle the debts downstairs first

114
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,000
and calm them down.

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,200
By the way,

116
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,120
Old Man Shi is my foster father.

117
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,870
When I ran away,

118
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,070
he was the one who took me in.

119
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,870
Now he's getting older

120
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,460
and has mild senile dementia.

121
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,400
He's sometimes clear-headed
and sometimes confused.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't worry, Young Master.

123
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,300
Since he's your foster father,

124
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,430
he's the Master's benefactor.

125
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll arrange for someone
to care for him.

126
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,230
Okay.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,240
It's just a piece of stone.

128
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,070
Can you feel it?

129
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
It's just a piece of stone.

130
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,030
Well.

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,670
Some people see it as jade,

132
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,080
while others take it for a stone.

133
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,480
Whatever it's worth,

134
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,750
it's not as important as our happiness.

135
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,470
(Grandpa,)

136
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,670
(I must find you.)

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,780
(Gu Residence)

138
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,630
Miss,

139
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,000
I've looked into Shi Lai's past.

140
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,000
He's a drifter from Stone Village.

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,440
He was raised by an old man.

142
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,360
(Shi Lai's profile)
It should be the elder

143
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,350
he played the trick with.

144
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,790
The villagers say

145
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,440
they love studying stones.

146
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,320
Miss, Shi Lai is quite young.

147
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,800
He might not truly know about stones.

148
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,150
The stone he picked

149
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,360
might just be a lucky guess.

150
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,790
Then you try to guess
a few million out of it.

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,270
The result of the Yongjing Private Club

152
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,320
will not only impact
the Feishang Group's market share,

153
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,720
but also its qualification for
the Gumie Public Auction.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,840
We can't lose to
the Lu Family this time.

155
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
I see.

156
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,000
Since we met him last time
at Jade Street,

157
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,390
he might go there again.

158
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Zhang Qi, cancel all my appointments
for next week.

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,800
I'll visit Jade Street every day.

160
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
Alright.

161
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,870
Shi Lai.

162
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,750
I will win you over.

163
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,230
Young Master.

164
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,360
Mr. Shi has been arranged into
the best nursing home in Yongjing.

165
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,030
There are professional medical staff.

166
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,870
Don't worry.

167
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,870
Okay.

168
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,720
- Ah?
- What's wrong?

169
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
This jade is clearly polished.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
But there's a subtle crack

171
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,390
on the surface.

172
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,510
Is it two jade pieces joined

173
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,990
and something is hidden inside?
