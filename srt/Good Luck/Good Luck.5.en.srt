=Episode 5=

3
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,750
Why are you only here now?

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,750
It's almost starting.

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,790
This is such a big yard,

6
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,790
with so many twists and turns.

7
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,670
It's hard to find!

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,390
Who is she?

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,600
- Linda.
- She...

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,700
The owner of Jade Bar?

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,360
Yes, that's me.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
You two talk first,

13
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,990
I'll leave now.

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,000
By the way, Shi Lai,

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,040
you still

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,480
haven't returned my scarf.

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,120
Didn't you say it was a gift to me?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,560
Don't forget to return it

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,640
next time we meet.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,190
Young Master.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
Who is she again?

22
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,710
She's my...

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,960
secretary.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,120
Personal secretary.

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,070
So, you should step outside for a moment.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,070
I need to talk

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,950
to your boss.

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,640
A secretary, huh?

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,870
Good for you, Shi Lai.

30
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,120
Looks like you've moved up

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,400
since you came to this private club,

32
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,230
and you even found such a hot secretary.

33
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,040
Miss Gu, are you jealous?

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,510
I'm just reminding you

35
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,550
not to forget

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,790
that today you're my stone appraiser!

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,990
Young Master.

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,070
When attending such an event,

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,350
I suggest you be cautious

40
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,790
and trust no one easily.

41
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,790
- I got it.
- Come.

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,630
Young Master.

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,790
- Let's hurry and change clothes.
- I'm so sorry!

44
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,090
It's fine, it's fine.

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,120
No need to change clothes…

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,630
Miss Secretary,

47
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,360
please wait outside.

48
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,710
Qiao Na,

49
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,630
wait for me.

50
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,180
Alright, Young Master.

51
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,140
I'll be right outside.

52
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,500
If anything happens,

53
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,060
I'll be the first to appear.

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,340
No, no, no. It's fine.

55
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,180
I'll handle it myself.

56
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,060
Don't worry, I'll help you.

57
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,900
No, no!

58
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,620
There aren't any other clothes
to change into here,

59
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,060
except for this one.

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Just make do with it.

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,420
Miaomiao, aren't you going out?

62
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,380
What's wrong with a girl

63
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,420
staying here?

64
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,900
You're a big man, why are you shy?

65
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,580
Shi Lai.

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,820
I want you...

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
What... what?

68
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,420
What's going on, Young Master?

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,700
I didn't see anything!

70
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,330
I'll go prepare your clothes
for the competition.

71
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,740
I...

72
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,300
I'll go to the bathroom.

73
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,770
Watch where you're walking!

74
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,850
It's you again, this country bumpkin.

75
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,860
Lu Jingzhao.

76
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,380
I was mistaken.

77
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,950
The stone gambling master
Lin Jiang's grandson,

78
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,660
Miaomiao's boyfriend, right?

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,700
Did you come here

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,980
to be a waiter?

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,410
- I came here to...
- Go.

82
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Get me

83
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,980
a glass of wine!

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,980
If you want to drink, get it yourself.

85
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,750
You!

86
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,140
Shi Lai is not only my boyfriend,

87
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,700
but he's also my stone appraiser.

88
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,580
Disrespecting him

89
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,980
is disrespecting me.

90
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,260
Seriously?

91
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,830
He's a stone appraiser?

92
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,700
He probably only knows
how to appraise pebbles!

93
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,420
Friends,

94
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,140
look at him,

95
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,980
how can anyone tell

96
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,820
if he's from the Lin family

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,700
or just some dog from the Gu family?

98
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,020
Look,

99
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,820
isn't that the Lin family's
useless young master?

100
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,140
Yeah, look at his shabby appearance.

101
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,180
A toad trying to eat swan meat.

102
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,100
Mr. Lu,

103
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,020
how's your stone

104
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,860
turning out?

105
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,740
The raw stone turned out to be a bust!

106
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,700
- What?
- Inside, there's only a faint red color.

107
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,540
Are you sure?

108
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,900
Brother,

109
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,900
what...

110
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,820
what's going on?

111
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
So you're the one

112
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,180
who's been blinded!

113
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,940
For the next few meals,

114
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,380
you'd better study some wild vegetables!

115
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,580
No!

116
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,500
Please!

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,780
Brother.

118
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,860
What's so great

119
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,900
about your wild vegetables?

120
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,580
I hired a master this time.

121
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,990
With your blind guesses,
you're not even worthy

122
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,820
to help him put on his shoes.

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,180
Wait and see!

124
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,060
We'll definitely beat you today!

125
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,550
- Let's go.
- Miaomiao.

126
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,900
Come on!

127
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,140
Darn it!

128
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,900
Now,

129
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,380
we've arrived at the most exciting part

130
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,740
of this private event:

131
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,420
the stone appraisal competition.

132
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,570
All participants need to pay a five million

133
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,060
and they can choose

134
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,500
any raw stone

135
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,740
from the venue.

136
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,430
You have one hour.

137
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,940
Whether you lose or win

138
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,700
depends on your judgment.

139
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,140
Shi Lai,

140
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,820
you don't need to take first place,

141
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,820
just beat that guy.

142
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,980
Mmm.

Miss Gu

145
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,300
is straightforward.

146
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,700
That's it?

147
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,380
Haven't chosen yet?

(Stone Appraisal Competition Countdown)

149
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,620
What's taking so long?

150
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,620
Only ten minutes left!

151
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,580
Don't rush.

152
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,140
Master,

153
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
is this the one you like?

154
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,260
From this small window,

155
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,260
the transparency is outstanding.

156
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,300
It almost reaches ninety percent.

157
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,520
The light is clear and transparent,

158
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,060
with fluorescence.

159
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,380
It's definitely glassy jadeite!

160
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,460
Alright!

161
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,220
We'll

162
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,580
take it!

163
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,460
Be careful.

164
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,300
Be careful!

Only three minutes left.

169
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,580
Wait a little longer.

170
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,380
I suggest you

171
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,940
just pick something randomly.

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,380
The longer you wait,

173
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,620
the more embarrassing it gets.

174
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,780
Shut up!

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Shi Lai, where are you going?

he's running away!

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,460
Alright,

179
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,980
since everyone has made their choices,

we'll start the first round of cutting.

Hey,

185
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,300
you little kid,

186
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,660
are you seriously

187
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,120
going to pick a stone

188
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,100
as a filler for your jadeite?

189

Do you

190
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,060
even know what a filler stone is?

191
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
It's specifically used

192

to support better stones,

193
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,780

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,340
damp and corroded.

195
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,100
Shi Lai.

196
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,820
Don't worry,

197
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,900
I won't mess this up.

198
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,830
So beautiful!

199
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,380
Imperial green?

200
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,300
It's glassy imperial green!

201
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,460
Imperial green!

202
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,780
Incredible!

203
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,420
No wonder he's a master!

204
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
Master.

205
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,220
Master!

206
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,060
Truly amazing!

207
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,340
Your eye for stones is razor-sharp!

208
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,100
You flatter me.

209
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,180
I

210
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,340
just got lucky.

211
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,420
The chance of imperial green coming out

212
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,820
is one in ten thousand,

213
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,580
and this glassy one
with such great transparency...

214
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,740
it's

215
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,680
a once-in-a-lifetime

216
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,900
opportunity for Mr. Lu.

217
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,300
Shi Lai,

218
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,740
looks like

219
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,700
you're going to lose today.

220
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,940
Not yet.

221
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,100
The result's not out.

222
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Wake up!

223
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,900
Do you really think

224
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,900
your little rock

225
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,300
can be worth more than

226
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,660
this glassy imperial green?

227
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,940
If your stone can produce

228
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,700
something more valuable than mine,

229
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,020
I, Lu Jingzhao,

230
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,180
will run around this place naked!

231
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,780
Okay!

232
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,020
But if you lose,

233
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,500
get out of Yongjing immediately

234
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,300
and never set foot in the stone world again!

235
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,690
Shi Lai,

236
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,900
don't agree to it!

237
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,660
Fine,

238
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,540
I agree.

239
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,100
Mr. Shi Lai's raw stone has been cut.

240
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,820
It's only a ten-centimeter ivory variety,

241
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,060
not worth much.

242
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,260
Ivory?

243
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,340
I told you!

244
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,020
This filler stone

245
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,900
won't yield anything valuable!

246
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,820
Young man,

247
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,880
if your skills are only this level,

248
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,740
you shouldn't be showing off
at such an event.

249
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,100
After all, only those with real abilities

250
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,820
are here to compete,

251
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,540
not those who bluff.

252
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,780
Who is this kid?

253
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,020
Trying to embarrass himself
in front of Master Dai.

254
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,940
Miss Gu really picked

255
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,780
the wrong guy.

256
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,060
Yeah,

257
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,100
this kid is pretty good at bluffing.

258
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,130
He even fooled Miss Gu.

259
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,840
He's just too young.

260
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,690
Shi Lai...

261
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,180
Don't worry.

262
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,020
Trust me.

263
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,060
Miaomiao,

264
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,420
can't you see?

265
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,580
He's just a big scam artist!

266
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,300
You're new to society,

267
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,540
so it's normal

268
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,900
to be tricked.

269
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,540
But you can count on me.

270
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,900
Get away!

271
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,180
Shi Lai,

272
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,420
I believe in you.

273
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,700
The facts are right in front of you.

274
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,420
The winner of this bet

275
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,820
is me.

276
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,940
You'd better leave Yongjing now!

277
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,780
Can I cut one more slice?

278
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,860
Sure.

279
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,660
You can cut as many slices as you want.

280
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,940
Young man,

281
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,940
this is obviously an ivory variety,

282
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,340
and it already makes up
two-thirds of the stone.

283
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,060
Even if you cut it into powder,

284
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,180
you won't find jade.

285
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,260
Please

286
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,900
cut one more slice

287
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,380
