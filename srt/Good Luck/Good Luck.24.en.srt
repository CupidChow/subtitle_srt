00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,460
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,680
Shi Lai,

4
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,960
you were so cool!

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,450
But why were you so still
when the competition started?

6
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,560
I forgot to bring my money!

7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,470
Luckily, I found 20 yuan.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,420
You forgot your money?

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,880
You're telling me

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,640
that you won the competition
using just 20 yuan

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,450
because you forgot your money?

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,960
Linda! Linda!

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,230
Help, Linda!

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,870
Help, Master Nine!

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
Help!

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,910
Come on.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,870
After all, Shi Lai won today.

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,410
Let him off this time.

19
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,840
Let's toast to Shi Lai's victory today.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,960
Cheers!

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,560
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,880
Miaomiao, you're not good at drinking.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,990
Don't drink too much!

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,710
I'm happy.

25
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,850
I'm happy
you won the championship!

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,700
I'm happy
that you've become a legend.

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,560
I'm happy that you're getting better.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,320
Shi Lai,

29
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,680
do you feel confident about

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,990
the upcoming Death Game?

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
If you need anything,

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,590
just let me know.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,580
Thank you, Master Nine.

34
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,100
No need to thank me.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,870
As long as Miaomiao isn't worried,

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,950
that's all that matters.

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm…

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,340
I'm going to puke!

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,670
Don't come with me!

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Sit back down.

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,030
- Grandpa, come with?
- Just sit.

42
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,870
I'll go over there.

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,990
Legend,

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,400
care for a drink with me?

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't worry,

46
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,800
this glass of wine won't get you drunk.

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,710
Shi Lai,

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,610
are you really going to the Death Game?

49
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,870
Yes.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,750
Actually, I think you should

51
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,700
think it over.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,120
After all, you're in the spotlight now,

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
so maybe,

54
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,450
you should take your time.

55
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,750
Looks like

56
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,870
you've already made your decision.

57
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,270
The Death Game

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,750
is the only trail to find my grandpa,

59
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,630
so I must go.

60
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,710
Hmm.

61
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,390
Guilao is elusive,

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,570
so I don't know much about him.

63
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,150
From now on,

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,160
be careful.

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,200
Don't worry,

66
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,910
I'll be back safe.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,870
You still have a lot
to say to me, right?

68
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,150
I still want to hear it.

69
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,310
It must hurt, right?

70
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,360
Of course it hurts! Look!

71
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,080
Look at all these bruises.

72
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,800
You two really went hard on me!

73
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,620
It was just a class, was it necessary?

74
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,620
Look, they're all here.

75
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,840
Look at this!

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,030
Seriously?

77
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,000
This one too! And here!

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,840
Let me see.

79
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,150
Let me see!

80
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,590
Let me see!

81
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,230
Please, enough already.

82
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,680
Poor little guy.

83
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,710
Linda,

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,830
you've really disappointed me.

85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,430
The invitation to the Death Game

86
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,600
still hasn't arrived?

87
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,130
It's been three days already!

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,520
Don't worry, Miaomiao.

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,190
Guilao is elusive.

90
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,270
We can't get flustered
before he makes a move.

91
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,590
How can I not worry?

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,800
Now I can't even reach Linda.

93
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,510
Could something happen to her?

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
She should be busy finishing up

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,170
for the Gumie Public Auction.

96
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,160
What's so important?

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,300
Doesn't she know to prioritize?

98
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,710
Right!

99
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,190
This is a tracker.

100
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,030
Carry it with you.

101
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,750
If you're in danger, press here.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,790
Help!

103
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,790
Take it.

104
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,800
So that wherever you are,

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,640
I can find you.

106
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,040
No matter where?

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Isn't that stalking?

108
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,790
You…!

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,320
Who was that?

110
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,670
Someone knocked on the wrong door.

111
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,780
(Death)

112
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,270
I wonder how long you can hold on.

113
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,160
After fighting together so many times,

114
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,190
this time

115
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,190
you must hold on.

116
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,060
(Wait for me.)

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,820
(To Linda)
Linda,

118
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,100
(Shi Lai)
wait for me.

119
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,700
(Shi Lai: Linda, wait for me.)

120
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,240
Your little lover is coming.

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,750
Do you want to meet him?

122
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,750
Welcome to

123
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,240
the Death Game.

124
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,240
You're finally here.

125
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,320
What do you think of this Death Game?

126
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,990
Pretty good.

127
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,750
Eerie

128
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,030
and spooky,

129
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,060
it would be perfect for a haunted house.

130
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,840
You really didn't disappoint me,

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
full of courage.

132
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,840
But you disappointed me.

133
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,630
Is it fun to play tricks
and scare people?

134
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,080
The Death Game was originally meant to

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,270
select the world's greatest talents

136
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,840
and pick qualified participants

137
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,480
to cut the legendary Xuantian Zibing stone.

138
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,960
The Death Game

139
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
is just the final test for
these talents.

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,910
It's been exaggerated by rumors,

141
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,030
saying that the Death Game
is a cruel place.

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Though it's just a rumor,

143
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
it's surprising how exaggerated

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,960
it has become.

145
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,000
Isn't that because of your theatrics?

146
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,280
Enough talk.

147
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm here for one thing.

148
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,000
Where is my grandpa?

149
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
My theatrics?

150
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,960
I don't like it either.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,360
So this time,

152
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,960
I want the Death Game
to live up to its name.

153
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,630
Guilao, you…!

154
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,460
I'll take your life directly.

155
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
Are you scared?

156
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,550
If you are, I can let you go.

157
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,200
But your grandpa's whereabouts

158
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,960
will forever remain a mystery to you.

159
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Let's get started.

160
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,080
Guilao,

161
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,670
you're using dirty tricks!

162
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,630
Did I ever say
that I won't use dirty tricks?

163
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,960
Do you know why your grandpa
joined the Death Game?

164
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
A few months ago, I spread news that

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,240
the Gumie Public Auction
had information about you.

166
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,790
Your grandpa, Lin Jiang,

167
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,840
didn't hesitate to come.

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,910
And you, to find information about him,

169
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,600
also came to the Death Game.

170
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,670
You two really are family!

171
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,120
The old one is brainless,

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,720
and the young one isn't much better.

173
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,350
(Stay awake, Shi Lai!)

174
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
(No…)

175
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,840
(I can barely see.)

176
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
What's wrong?

177
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,080
You can't see?

178
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,980
I tell you that

179
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,460
your grandpa is indeed in my hands.

180
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
Unfortunately,

181
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,360
knowing it won't make a difference.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
You can't see.

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,910
You still want to see him, right?

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,560
Guilao,

185
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,620
I won't let you get away with this!

186
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,550
Now I'll send you to see him.

187
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,320
Guilao,

188
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,440
come out!

189
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,560
Guilao!

190
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,670
What did you do to me?!

191
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,750
Who are you?

192
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,390
Who?

193
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
Who?!

194
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,480
Who's speaking?!

195
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,630
Who?

196
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,840
It looks like

197
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,360
you've also been blinded by Guilao.

198
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,840
You too?

199
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,180
That jerk!

200
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,440
When I get out, I'll not let him off!

201
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,580
Get out?

202
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,500
You're blind now,

203
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,550
what good will getting out do?

204
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,720
The blindness can be cured.

205
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,380
If you don't even have
the courage to escape,

206
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,040
then you are really blind!

207
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
You're quite bold.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
Young man,

209
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,960
what's your name?

210
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,470
Shi Lai.

211
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,960
What about you?

212
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm Lin Jiang.

213
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,920
Lin Jiang?

214
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,630
You're my grandpa!

215
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Guilao,

216
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,030
what trick are you playing now?

217
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,670
Trying to find someone
to pretend to be my grandson

218
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,200
and get information from me?

219
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,320
Do you think

220
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,390
I'll believe you?

221
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm not pretending to be your grandson!

222
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,480
No, I'm not your grandson!

223
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,100
Acting. Keep acting!

224
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,420
Let's be clear,

225
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,790
you're just trying to get
my Cloud Vision Skill, right?

226
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,200
You're trying to
get my Cloud Vision Skill!

227
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,200
Did you just say

228
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,720
you're my grandson?

229
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,840
I never said I'm your grandson.

230
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,360
Don't try to take advantage of me.

231
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,480
Whether you're my grandson or not,

232
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,480
have you opened the safe?

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,320
I have.

234
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,630
What's the matter?

235
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,560
Then…

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
you should know

237
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,570
what's inside.

238
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,810
I know what it is,
but I'm not telling you.

239
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,920
Sun Wukong.

240
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,800
How…

241
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,030
How do you know it's Sun Wukong inside?

242
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
I'm asking you,

243
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,320
what did Sun Wukong say?

244
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,840
There's a recording inside.

245
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,990
Tell me,

246
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,920
what did he say?

247
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,960
Sun Wukong said…

248
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
