3
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,640
In the end, you lost to a blind man.

4
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,230
Right!

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Right!

6
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,990
Right!

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,080
Blind...

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,240
Blind! Let me go blind!

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,810
- Grandpa! Grandpa!
- Let me go blind!

10
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,680
No, Grandpa!

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:06,970
Grandpa!

12
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,070
The Cloud Vision Skill!
Xuantian Zibing stone!

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,040
They're both mine!

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,460
Both mine! Mine!

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,680
Grandpa!

16
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,040
They're both mine!

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,810
Mine!

18
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,790
It's just a stone.

19
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,990
Xuantian Zibing stone is mine.

20
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,310
It's mine.

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,310
- It's all mine.
- Take him away.

22
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,200
Mine! Mine!

23
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,060
My Xuantian Zibing stone!

24
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,030
Brother!

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120
What should we do?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,950
What should we do, brother?!

27
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,430
Brother.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Is there really no way out?

29
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,250
I don't want to go to prison.

30
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,960
I don't want to go to prison!

31
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,640
Brother!

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,500
I don't want to go to prison, brother!

33
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,560
Eat. It's just right.

34
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,120
It'll get cold.

35
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,790
Brother!

36
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,220
Brother…

37
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,590
This calamity...

38
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,590
can't be avoided.

39
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,270

40
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,990
Linda.

41
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,850
I'm going to have to
undergo an investigation.

42
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,750
I've done many bad things
for Master Nine over the years.

43
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,160
It's time to pay for what I've done.

44
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,920
But considering my contribution,

45
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,100
I should be able
to get a lighter sentence.

46
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,150
Linda,

47
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,340
I've dragged you down.

48
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
No,

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,630
you saved me.

50
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,500
You saved me twice.

51
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,710
Twice?

52
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,510
The first time, you saved me
from the human traffickers.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,390
The second time, you freed me
from Guilao's clutches.

54
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,350
But…

55
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,130
Don't worry about me.

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Perhaps accepting a fair trial

57
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,750
is the only way I can truly be free.

58
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,800
I'll testify for you.

59
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
You're a good person.

60
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,650
You were just forced into it.

61
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,950
Stop it,

62
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,870
I've done a lot of bad things.

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
No,

64
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,880
I trust you,

65
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,360
no matter what happens.

66
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,120
Take good care of your eyes.

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,190
Next time we meet, I hope you can see me.

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
Linda...

69
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,120
Alright, enough said.

70
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,750
Someone's waiting for you.

71
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Grandpa's in trouble.

72
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,600
There's also a shift
in the overseas mines of our company.

73
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,640
Now Feishang Group employees
need me to calm things down.

74
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,920
I have to go abroad immediately

75
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,920
and can't stay with you.

76
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,470
Shi Lai,

77
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,720
can we still go back to how we were?

78
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
What?

79
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,040
There are many things I can't change.

80
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,560
Do we still have a chance to start over?

81
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,160
Everything is already over,

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,640
isn't it?

83
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,680
So, will you forgive me?

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,390
You never hurt me.

85
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Take care of your eyes.

86
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,720
Don't forget, I was the first to see you.

87
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900

He says he wants to travel the world.

91
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,270
And I…

92
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,960
You're leaving too?

93
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,000
Young Master,

94
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,320
this South American animal migration

95
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,480
is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

96
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,080
It's always been my dream.

97
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,510
I want to go see it.

98
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,980
You really want to leave me, don't you?

99
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,960
I don't mean it, Young Master!

100
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,720
- I just…
- Just kidding!

101
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,750
The world is so big,

102
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,150
everything is already over,

103
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
and you should enjoy your life now.

104
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,480
Thank you, Young Master!

105
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,870
No,

106
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,720
I should thank you.

107
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,750
Young Master,

108
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,320
take good care of your eyes.

109
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,550
I'll send you pictures.

110

116
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
I can't go home without one!

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,030
How am I supposed to get home,

118
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,870

Let me tell you,

137
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,750
I bought it in his livestream.

At the time, I thought their tools

139
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,240
were quite professional,

141
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,320
I had a gut feeling

142
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,120
that the raw stone they'd send me

143
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,990
wouldn't match the one
I saw in the live stream,

144
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,720
so I noted down some features.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,080
But the raw stone they sent me

146
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,570
was exactly the one I saw in the video!

147
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,360
And then? Get to the point.

148
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,630
Then it got cut and turned out like this!

149
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,560
How much did you pay?

150
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,390

156
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,550

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,440
Shi Lai,

189
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
over this past year,

190
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,870
I've thought a lot.

191
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,030
Many things have happened to me.

192
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,800
Many things

193
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,480
I don't want to remember.

194
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,750
I suddenly realized

195
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,720
I have to forget everything

196
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,720
and start my life anew.

197
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
Shi Lai,

198
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,510
you are an important person in my life,

199
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,040
but I think

200
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,390
it's best if we forget each other.

201
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm doing fine.

202
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,230
Don't worry about me.

203
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,470
Linda!

204
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,770
Linda.

205
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,200
So you're here.

206
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,750
I knew you were joking with me…

207
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,320
Linda? Who were you calling?

208
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,400
I was calling you, Miaomiao!

209
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,750
Really?

210
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,190
Yeah!

211
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,320
You must have just come back from abroad

212
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,220
and are a bit disoriented, jetlagged.

213
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,880
I don't believe you!

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,150
Let's go inside!

215
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,790
How come you're back?

216
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,270
What? Is it bad timing for me
to come back?

217
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,320
It's so good that you came back.

218
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,550
I've been so bored,

219
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,550
I'm the only one at home.

220
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,120
- Be careful.
- Is that so?

221
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,710
Have you eaten yet?

222
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,440
Not yet. Let's eat at home.

223
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,440
How about we go to a restaurant?

224
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,550
Let's eat at home.

225
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,240
No, no. Trust me,

226
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,960
the food at that restaurant is amazing.

227
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,990
I just want to eat at home!

228
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,480
Hurry up!

229
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
We'll go early to avoid the line!

230
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,390
I've been wanting to go for a long time!

231
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,910
- It's really delicious.
- Young Master!

232
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,960
I missed you so much!

233
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,740
I am so doomed…

234
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
Miaomiao,

235
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,650
it's not what you think.

236
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,200
Do you believe me?

237
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,320
Shi Lai!

238
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,600
Qiao Na, when did you get back?

239
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,750
Why didn't you tell me?

240
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,200
I wanted to surprise you.

241
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,630
I have a key anyway.

242
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,440
What?

243
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,720
She has a key?

244
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,910
Well, she lives here.

245
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,560
I want one too!

246
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,990
Well…

247
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,670
Okay, no problem.

248
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,650
By the way, Young Master,

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,990
I'll show you some photos.

250
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,230
Look.

251
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
A Brazilian tapir.

252
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,960
Cute, right?

253
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,030
How much do you love Brazilian tapirs?

254
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,340
Take pictures of something else!

255
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,320
I just went to see them!

256
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,360
How cute they are!

257
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,150
I also brought you gifts.

258
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,800
(Coffee Bean Gift Box)
Brazilian coffee beans.

259
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,810
Brazilian honey.

260
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,750
- Brazilian face masks.
- Alright, Qiao Na!

261
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,710
Thanks, thanks!

262
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,710
OK.

263
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,860
I also got you gifts!

264
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,270
French wine.

265
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,470
German beer.

266
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,750
Italian tie.

267
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,560
Alright, Miaomiao. Let's eat. Eat.

268
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,750
Linda?

269
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,030
You… you didn't leave?

270
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,510
I left.

271
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,720
Then I came back.

272
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Didn't you say you wanted to
forget the past and start over?

273
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,790
So, can we get to know each other again?

274
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,720
Hi, I'm Linda.

275
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,550
Can I come in?

276
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
I…

277
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
Well…

278
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,160
You…

279
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,960
