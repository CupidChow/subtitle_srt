00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,750
That was brutal…

4
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,790
Qiao Na...

5
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,350
Qiao Na...

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,760
You're not picky at all.

7
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,950
But it would cost extra.

8
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
Doctor,

9
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,820
how is he?

10
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,040
Is it serious?

11
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,070
Just light injuries,

12
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,130
a brief fainting spell.

13
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,980
Nothing major.

14
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,740
Thank you.

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,070
Young Master,

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
how are you? Does it still hurt?

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm fine.

18
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,670
I'm so sorry, Young Master!

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,760
It's all my fault!

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,610
I hit you too hard,

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,870
I hurt you! I…

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,840
Don't say that.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,590
The situation was urgent,

24
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,790
I brought this on myself.

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,040
You did great.

26
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,950
Thank you, Young Master!

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,440
I'll keep trying my best!

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,580
No need.

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,240
Young Master,

30
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,950
who kidnapped you

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,840
and drugged you?

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,950
They tried to use a honey trap

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,280
to ruin me.

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,560
The only people

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,840
who have a grudge against me in Yongjing

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
are Lu Jingzhao and Lu Jinghui.

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,810
Those evil brothers!

38
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,190
I will…

39
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,960
I'm sorry…

40
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,360
I will not let them get away with this!

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
Hi, Shi Lai?

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,910
Oh, Zhang Qi.

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,750
What's going on?

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,590
What?

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,680
Shi Lai is injured?

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,310
Yes, it's right here!

47
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,580
- Is it this part?
- Yes, yes.

48
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,800
In broad daylight,

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
and what are you…

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
doing?

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,710
Miss Gu,

52
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,150
you're supposed to knock
before entering someone's room!

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,750
What are you doing in Shi Lai's room?

54
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,030
I'm his secretary.

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,360
Personal secretary.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,470
I'm giving Young Master a rehab massage.

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,150
Shi Lai, I brought you some fruit.

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
Try it.

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
Miss Gu,

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,190
he's recovering.

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,800
He should avoid
high sugar, high-calorie foods

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,870
and stick to a light diet.

63
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,240
I haven't asked you yet.

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,430
How did he get hurt like this?

65
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,400
I hit him.

66
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,560
Why did you hit him?

67
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,710
I...

68
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
I was drugged.

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,360
Qiao Na was helping me.

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,190
You were drugged,

71
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,590
but why didn't she
take you to the hospital?

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,190
Miss Gu, you're being unreasonable.

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,590
Did I say something wrong?

74
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,190
As his secretary,

75
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,750
you not only let him fall into danger,

76
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,750
but also hurt him.

77
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,910
You should just resign!

78
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,430
If Young Master thinks
I've failed in my duties,

79
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,470
he will tell me to leave.

80
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,590
It's not for you, an outsider,
to point fingers!

81
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,930
Qiao Na,

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,400
I want some roasted sweet potatoes.

83
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,640
Roasted sweet potatoes?

84
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
Alright.

85
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,630
Miaomiao, I want some ice cream.

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
Don't try to distract me.

87
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,350
By the way,

88
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
did I say anything inappropriate

89
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,600
when I was drunk yesterday?

90
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,600
You just confessed.

91
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,070
Did... did you agree to it?

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
I agreed to be your stone appraiser

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,560
and go with you
to the Gumie Public Auction.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,190
You only being my boyfriend

95
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,480
will give Grandpa a chance to help you.

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,390
Even if it's a fake

97
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,600
or temporary, you'll have to do it.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,430
Fine, it'll be fake and temporary.

99
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,160
Once I find my grandpa, it'll end.

100
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,590
Deal!

101
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,030
Shi Lai!

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,630
You heartless man!

103
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,470
A cheater!

104
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,440
Don't even think about going to

105
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,600
the Gumie Public Auction now!

106
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,230
Miaomiao!

107
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,080
Miaomiao!

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,040
Miaomiao, why are you suddenly like this?

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,430
Don't touch me, cheater!

110
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,270
You keep calling me a cheater,

111
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,440
there should be
some basis for that.

112
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,600
You look for yourself!

113
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,390
They really took a picture.

114
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,430
I was set up last night.

115
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,740
Look,

116
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,750
this is their honey trap
designed to frame me.

117
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,240
The photo clearly shows

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,430
I was drugged.

119
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,560
Whether you were framed or not,

120
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,190
the fact that you're hugging her remains.

121
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,400
I...

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,510
You're so understanding and smart,

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,700
you won't be unreasonable, will you?

124
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,520
I don't care.

125
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,160
The label of a heartless man

126
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
is already on you.

127
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Whether you can take it off

128
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,920
depends on your future actions.

129
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,190
I'm going to pick out a gift
for Grandpa's 70th birthday.

130
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,070
You reflect on yourself.

131
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,910
I'll go with you!

132
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,150
Not this one.

133
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,350
No.

134
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,590
Wait!

135
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,240
Don't throw things if you're not buying!

136
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,390
Those are worthless, throw them away.

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,400
Worthless?

138
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Why should I...

139
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
not believe you...?

140
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,070
He's my stone appraiser,

141
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,040
don't disturb him.

142
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,470
No problem.

143
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,710
How's it going?

144
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
Not good.

145
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,470
Sir,

146
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,560
is there anything else you need?

147
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,350
This one!

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,000
This one, right?

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,160
Sure!

150
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,960
Three colors!

151
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,630
Three-color jade!

152
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,590
Congratulations, Miss Gu!

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,600
There's a saying in the jade circle,

154
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,070
yellow and green together are priceless,

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,430
because they're extremely rare.

156
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,870
This jade is even rarer,

157
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,560
with three colors:
yellow, green, and purple.

158
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,070
This is called Tricolor Jade,

159
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,720
symbolizing happiness, wealth,
and longevity.

160
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,830
A statue carved from it as a gift

161
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,680
to your grandfather

162
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,870
would be perfect.

163
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,800
Miss Gu, are you satisfied?

164
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,870
Not bad.

165
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,870
I'll take off a small corner

166
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,560
of your heartless man label for now.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
Then quickly find the best carver

168
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,070
to work on this stone,

169
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,110
or it'll go to waste.

170
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,360
Alright, I'm on it.

171
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,630
Zhang Qi,

172
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,070
please contact the carver

173
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,800
who worked on
the eighteen arhats last time.

174
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
I have a high-quality stone

175
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
that needs his work.

176
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,000
Preparing a surprise?

177
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,870
Miss Linda,

178
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,880
your surprise almost killed me.

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,190
You seem to care a lot

180
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,190
about Miss Gu.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,510
Miaomiao has helped me so much.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,950
It's the least I can do.

183
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,600
You're calling her so affectionately.

184
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,950
When will you

185
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
start showing some concern

186
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,390
for your sister?

187
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,000
Miss Linda,

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,870
stop joking.

189
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,790
I've always respected you.

190
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,910
Besides,

191
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,870
you're so full of tricks,

192
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm scared of you.

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,600
So, does that mean

194
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,390
you think Miss Gu lacks tricks?

195
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,220
That's not what I meant!

196
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,810
- I...
- I know,

197
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,030
you mean I'm innocent and kind.

198
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,480
By the way, Mr. Shi,

199
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
I don't think you've returned

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
the scarf I gave you.

201
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
Maybe...

202
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,750
he wants to keep it as a memento.

203
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,040
What...?

204
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,960
Let me explain, it's not what you think.

205
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,900
Master Nine!

206
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,840
Happy Birthday!

207
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,750
Master, this is the gift from Miss Gu.

208
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,040
Grandpa!

209
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,080
I wish you happiness
as vast as the East Sea,

210
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,550
longevity like the South Mountain,

211
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,750
and eternal youth

212
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,750
like the pine and crane!

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
My clever granddaughter,

214
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
your words are so sweet.

215
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,030
Grandpa, this

216
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,000
is the gift Shi Lai prepared for you.

217
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,280
Master Nine,

218
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,960
we've come to wish you a happy birthday.

219
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,150
Jinghui. Jingzhao.

220
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,750
This is the gift we've prepared for you.

221
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,150
We hope you like it.

222
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,960
He's being too extravagant!

223
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,240
As the saying goes,
auspicious elephants bring wealth.

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,550
We're gifting you a statue of an elephant
made of icy green jade,

225
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,870
hoping your foundation is strong,

226
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,000
your steps steady,

227
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,670
and your life long and prosperous.

228
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,870
This is quite a feast for the eyes!

229
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,870
Who is he?

230
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,710
I don't know.

231
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,550
He's Private Club champion Shi Lai.

232
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,510
Oh, it's him.

233
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,750
Isn't he Master Lin Jiang's only grandson?

234
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,750
Does he also know Cloud Vision Skill?

235
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,510
He's quite the surprise!

236
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
What a treasure!

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,630
Master Nine, I'm not good with words.

238
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,750
I just wish you

239
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
a happy birthday,

240
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,870
good health,

241
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,000
and may you always smile.

242
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
Good.

243
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,710
Good!

244
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,910
I haven't seen such a harmonious

245
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,240
and perfect three-color jade

246
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,480
in years!

247
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,320
Grandpa,

248
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,550
this is the raw stone

249
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,510
Shi Lai picked out for you at the market

250
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,510
and carved.

251
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,360
Lin's grandson

252
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,670
has the same sharp eye!

253
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm glad you like it!

254
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,510
Young man, you do have a sharp eye.

255
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,200
May I know your name?

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
His name is Shi Lai,

257
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
my boyfriend.

258
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
Welcome, dear guests,

259
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,150
to the 70th birthday celebration

260
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,000
of Jade Society's Supervisor Gu Tingyu.

261
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,550
Now, please enjoy the birthday videos
recorded by friends and family

262
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,550
(Longevity)
from various fields for Master Nine.

263
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,910
This birthday banquet for Master Nine

264
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,200
really opened my eyes.

265
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,500
(Happiness as vast as the East Sea,
longevity like the South Mountain)

266
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,510
What?

267
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,790
Miss Gu must be blind,

268
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,270
picking a man like that.

269
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,360
A bastard is just a bastard!

270
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,790
So he's a shameless gold-digger!

271
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Shi Lai,

272
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,150
you really are a hypocrite!

273
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,000
How could you do such a despicable thing
behind Miaomiao's back!

274
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
Shi Lai,

275
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,790
isn't this the video
where you were framed?

276
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,870
What if I told Mr. Shi

277
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,630
that something is going to happen today?

278
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Stop, stop,

279
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,510
I don't want to know.

280
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,390
And your information is so expensive,
I can't afford it.

281
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,120
But if this is something

282
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,550
you can hardly handle?

283
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,960
Whatever comes, I'll face it.

284
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,440
It's my own business, Miss Linda.

285
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,960
The Lu family isn't here
for good intentions.

286
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
What to do now?

287
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,200
We need to stop the damage quickly.

288
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,670
Otherwise, the consequences
will be unthinkable.

289
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,080
(Shi Lai,)

290
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,960
(what are you still thinking?)

291
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Good!

292
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,550
