00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,800
Linda,

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,680
what's wrong?

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,560
This isn't the time for this,

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,400
Miss Linda!

7
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,960
Wake up!

8
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,350
- Cover yourself up.
- No.

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,760
Xiaoye,

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,150
navigate to the nearest hospital.

11
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,870
Okay, playing music for you.

12
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,070
Xiaoye,

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,400
turn off the music, please!

14
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,640
Okay, turning off the car windows.

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,520
Xiaoye...!

16
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,120
How do you have so much strength?

17
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,790
Shi Lai.

18
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,480
- Shi Lai, don't go.
- Don't do this, Miss Linda.

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
I'm not that kind of person...

20
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,480
Okay, locking the car doors for you.

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
I want...

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
I want...

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,120
Xiaoye, turn on the cool air!

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Okay, turning on the headlights for you.

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,590
(What's going on there?)

26
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,560
No! No!

27
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,650
No!

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,840
Help! Help!

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
The world's getting worse.

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,580
Miss Linda! Miss Linda!

31
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,460
Calm down!

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,500
You're disoriented right now.

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,580
You'll regret this when you wake up.

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,460
I'm...

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
calm.

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,020
- It's so hot...
- Cool air! Cool air!

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,730
Xiaoye, cool air!

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
Now turning on the cool air.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,860
Xiaoye.

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,300
Please speak.

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,460
Get lost!

42
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,420
Young Master.

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,500
Wow.

44
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,040
It's not what you think!

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,860
It's just your private matter.

46
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,580
But I still want to remind you.

47
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,120
You should take care of your health.

48
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,290
As the saying goes,

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,820
"Excessive desire leads to disaster."

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,700
I...

51
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,620
Qiao Na, it's really not what you think!

52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,420
Young Master,
if you don't want to hear it,

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,460
I won't say anything more.

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,860
It's just a kind reminder.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,460
Okay, navigating to the hospital for you.

56
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,140
Qiao Na.

57
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,070
What?

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,100
When buying a car,

59
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,460
make sure to get
the best voice assistant system!

60
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,180
An old man? And he brought helpers?

61
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,890
I'm also curious who it could be!

62
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,700
The Gu family?

63
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,740
An old man?

64
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,800
Could it be Master Nine?

65
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,610
They...

66
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,170
They might have taken photos!

67
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,300
I... I...

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
What are you panicking about?

69
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,900
This small interruption

70
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,060
won't affect our plan.

71
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,540
The reputation Feishang Group
has built up over years

72
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,480
will soon be ruined.

73
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,860
She got up.

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,140
Where did she run off to?

75
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
How did I end up here?

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,460
You were kidnapped,

77
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,580
and then I saved you.

78
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,140
So I should thank you properly.

79
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,040
But...

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,620
I don't think I was wearing this before.

81
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,820
Did you...

82
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,700
change me while I was unconscious?

83
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,700
Boy,

84
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,140
you're not honest!

85
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,060
It wasn't me! It was Qiao Na!

86
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,820
I swear I didn't see anything!

87
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,940
Is it C... or D?

88
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,940
It must be F.

89
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,070
Shi Lai,

90
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,620
the young and capable stone appraiser,

91
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,100
Master Lin Jiang's grandson,

92
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,220
is actually a scum
who takes advantage of others!

93
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,340
Sister Linda,

94
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,860
stop teasing me.

95
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,620
Alright,

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,540
I'll stop.

97
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,360
I'll investigate the people
who kidnapped me.

98
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,220
But now I need to talk to you
about something else.

99
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,980
What's the matter?

100
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,770
Who benefits

101
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,690
when the Gu family faces a crisis?

102
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,830
There's been a large number of
fake raw stones

103
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,100
from Longshan on the market.

104
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,860
Customers are demanding huge compensation

105
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,220
from Feishang Group's affiliates.

106
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,770
One or two cases we can handle,

107
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,100
but with the current amount,

108
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,490
all the merchants on Jade Street

109
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,740
will be unable to do business!

110
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,860
They're also looking to
terminate contracts with us.

111
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,780
Have we contacted PR companies?

112
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,620
It's useless!

113
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,860
Without actual compensation,

114
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,420
the public opinion can't be suppressed.

115
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,660
But if we give in,

116
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,540
it's like admitting
we've committed fraud.

117
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,610
Shi Lai, what should we do?

118
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,480
If these merchants leave,

119
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,280
Jade Street will be nothing but a name.

120
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,980
This is a deliberate scheme

121
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,100
to put Feishang Group

122
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,180
in a difficult position.

123
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,440
Miaomiao,

124
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,220
can you buy another batch of
raw stones from Longshan?

125
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,020
Of course. What do you want to do?

126
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,900
Since they want compensation,

127
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,660
we'll give it to them.

128
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,220
But we can explain it differently.

129
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,660
The fake Longshan raw stones

130
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,420
are intentionally smeared to
frame Feishang Group.

131
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,540
However, Feishang Group
is partially responsible

132
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,970
for failing to supervise
the situation properly.

133
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,050
Therefore,

134
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,900
the group is willing to exchange

135
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,980
with authentic Longshan raw stones.

136
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
That's a good idea.

137
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,420
This way we can silence the rumors

138
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,900
and explain the fake raw stones.

139
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,780
Zhang Qi, get it done right away.

140
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,180
On it.

141
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,980
But this is just a temporary solution.

142
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,660
What if the Liu family

143
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,100
releases fake raw stones again?

144
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,460
Don't worry, they won't have the chance.

145
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
You're back, Young Master.

146
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,300
Linda has already left?

147
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,300
Yes, Young Master.

148
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,460
Here's the check she left for you.

149
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,380
(Cash check, One Million Yuan)

150
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,540
(Linda)

151
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,420
Linda, thank you for your help
with the Gu family matter.

152
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,140
Small matter.

153
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,660
Forgive me for leaving
without saying goodbye.

154
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,540
I didn't stay.

155
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,100
You won't be disappointed, will you?

156
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,500
No, no.

157
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,980
Please be safe on your way.

158
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,660
Don't worry.

159
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,420
A person like me

160
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,460
is destined to be accompanied
by the night.

161
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,180
Linda, what's the meaning

162
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,100
of this one million check?

163
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,980
No meaning.

164
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,980
I wanted to offer myself to you,

165
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
but you didn't want me.

166
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,500
Linda,

167
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,100
I didn't save you for money.

168
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,660
If you don't like it,
you can tear it up.

169
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,860
I don't accept returns on things
I give away.

170
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,540
Come to Jade Bar next time,

171
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,620
I'll give you a discount.

172
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,220
Bye.

173
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,500
Linda,

174
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,900
I really didn't do it for money!

175
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,020
Hello? Hello?

176
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,980
Dangerous woman.

177
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,660
Sorry, Young Master,

178
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,060
I might have said too much,

179
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,500
but that woman...

180
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,860
she's not simple.

181
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,620
I know.

182
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,340
That's why I've always refused
to cooperate with her.

183
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,100
But she really

184
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,760
knows a lot of things I need,

185
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,620
especially intelligence.

186
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,020
Plus, I saved her this time,

187
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,300
so there shouldn't be any big issues.

188
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,220
I spoke out of turn.

189
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,540
Rest early.

190
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,100
On one side we have Gu Yunmiao,

191
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,220
and on the other side we have Linda.

192
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,740
Take care of yourself, Young Master.

193
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,540
(Lu Group)

194
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,140
That Shi Lai

195
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,580
really isn't easy to deal with.

196
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,830
Not only can he appraise stones,

197
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,230
but he's also sharp.

198
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,460
He was able to reverse

199
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,930
the situation like this.

200
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,770
After Feishang Group compensated
for some raw stones,

201
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,180
their reputation bounced back.

202
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,420
Checkmate.

203
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,300
No big deal.

204
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,060
Let them enjoy for a while.

205
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,460
I knew

206
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,460
you must have

207
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,900
something up your sleeve, Mr. Lu!

208
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,780
As long as the key places
have our pieces,

209
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,120
what kind of storm
can the opponent stir up?

210
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,940
In the end,

211
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,150
it's still a deadlock.

212
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,060
Checkmate.

213
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,420
(Feishang Group)

214
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,020
Ghost!

215
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,780
So you're the insider!

216
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
Zhang Qi,

217
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,660
I trusted you

218
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,940
so much,

219
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,420
but you secretly betrayed Feishang.

220
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Miss.

221
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,700
Mr. Shi.

222
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,540
I... I was just checking

223
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,700
the raw stones that came in
from Longshan.

224
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,900
I was about to turn on the light

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,980
when you scared me.

226
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,300
You don't need to defend yourself.

227
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,540
This was all set up to expose you.

228
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,830
When we traded with
our client Yan Wenhan,

229
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,180
the person who impersonated an employee

230
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,820
to infiltrate the company

231
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,060
and replace the raw stones

232
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,340
couldn't have done it

233
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,940
without help from an insider.

234
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,460
The fake Longshan raw stones
are the same situation.

235
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,100
That's why Miaomiao and I
designed this game.

236
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,340
Liu Xinchen obtained the outer skins

237
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,060
of fake Longshan raw stones through an insider
to make the fakes.

238
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,580
We deliberately purchased
a batch of Longshan raw stones.

239
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,460
To continue faking,

240
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,700
they would definitely send an insider
to steal them again.

241
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,540
I see.

242
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
As expected of you, well done.

243
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,060
Now that we have both the person
and the evidence,

244
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,420
what else is there to say?

245
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,820
Confess honestly,

246
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,300
and maybe Miaomiao
will treat you leniently.

247
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,540
Miss!

248
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,300
I was wrong!

249
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,700
Zhang Qi,

250
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,900
we've treated you well all these years.

251
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,940
Why did you betray us?

252
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,180
Miss!

253
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,980
I had no choice!

254
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,340
I owed too much gambling debt.

255
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,300
If I didn't repay it,

256
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
I wouldn't have a life left!

257
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,900
The person said

258
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,040
if I helped him get the skin,

259
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,900
he'd pay off

260
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,910
all my debts! I...

261
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,700
That person was Liu Xinchen, right?

262
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
I don't know!

263
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,480
I don't know who he is!

264
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,330
I've never met him,

265
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,450
we only communicate over the phone.

266
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,650
Our deal was

267
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,820
to bury the cash in one place,

268
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,440
and then tell me where to find it.

269
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,460
How is that possible?

270
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,480
Are you still trying to lie to me?

271
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,360
No, Miss!

272
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,700
Everything I said is true!

273
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,540
Miaomiao,

274
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,930
I think he's telling the truth.

275
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,700
Based on our encounters,

276
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,700
our opponents are very cunning,

277
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,980
very meticulous,

278
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,580
and don't leave traces easily.

279
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,700
Miss, I was wrong!

280
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,050
I was wrong!

281
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,440
Please spare me!

282
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,120
Now that this lead is cut off,

283
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,010
do we need to go to Jade Bar again?

284
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,520
Miaomiao!

285
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,340
Do you know any

286
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,180
professional network technicians?

287
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,910
Of course.

288
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,330
Yesterday, we found the signal address
linked to Zhang Qi.

289
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,180
It's all marked on the map.

290
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,740
This is

291
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
a signal-dense area.

292
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,180
Look,

293
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,060
(Hengda Dijing)
Liu Xinchen's mansion is here.

294
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,100
Not only that,

295
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,140
(Lu Group)
but also the Lu family's.

296
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,780
Lu family?

297
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,740
Lu Jinghui!

298
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,060
No wonder.

299
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,180
Liu Xinchen didn't have
the brains for this,

300
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,060
but it turns out
there's someone behind him.

301
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,340
But even if we know,

302
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,700
we don't have proof.

303
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,940
There are

304
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,320
multiple signals here.

305
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,460
Liu Xinchen often visits here…

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,940
This place is...?

307
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,060
Lai,

308
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,050
didn't expect us to meet again so soon.

309
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,700
Miss Gu's here too.

310
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,710
Something urgent?

311
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,950
Linda, here's the thing.

312
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,100
We want to ask you about someone.

313
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,140
It's Liu Xinchen.

314
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,980
Young Master Liu?

315
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
He often comes here.

316
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,950
Then you must know a lot about him?

317
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,370
Linda,

318
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,340
we need your help.

319
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,940
Don't worry,

320
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,420
we'll repay you.

321
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,050
Interesting.

322
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,950
This sounds like a thankless task.

323
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,880
Obviously,

324
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,700
I'll be dragged into the conflict
between you and Jade Society.

325
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,180
How do you plan to repay me

326
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,690
for this big favor?

327
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,140
How much do you want?

328
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,980
Name your price.

329
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,580
Miss Gu, you're underestimating me.

330
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,720
Do I look like someone who lacks money?

331
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,300
Not all favors

332
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,940
can be repaid with money.

333
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,080
Now you know why I said

334
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,020
that money is the easiest thing

335
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,740
to repay?

336
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,660
Then what do you want?

337
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,340
The Gu family's power in Yongjing
isn't small.

338
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,700
Whatever you want,

339
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,650
we can satisfy it.

340
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,980
Big talk.

341
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,940
So what?

342
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,890
If I help,

343
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
it's to help my little brother Shi Lai.

344
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,760
Nowadays,

345
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,900
people…

346
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,780
are much more valuable than money.

347
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,300
You're joking again, Miss Linda.

348
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,820
You're not a human trafficker.

349
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,100
Cooperation is supposed

350
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,970
to be mutually agreed upon.

351
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,820
Yes,

352
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,700
I wouldn't sell you out.

353
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,460
But I'm a bit

354
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,910
bored recently.

355
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,540
Wondering if

356
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,400
you're free to accompany me tomorrow?

357
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,940
I…

358
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,420
I…

359
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,580
I sell my skills, not my body!

360
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,660
I can help you identify stones!

361
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,530
You're thinking too much.

362
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,010
What I'm after…

363
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,660
is something much more important.
