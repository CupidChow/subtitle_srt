00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,700
=Episode 1=
(This story is fictional, with no bad leads)

3
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,150
Can you feel it?

4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,700
(Young Shi Lai, Grandson of Lin Jiang, Lin Yun)
It's just a piece of stone.

5
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,430
Did you forget what I taught you?

6
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,150
Regulating your Qi plays a big part
in stone appraisal.

7
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,200
You need to condense
your energy into a line

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,460
so that you can sense
the essence of the jade

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,710
inside the stone rind.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
Our family has got a head start

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,510
with our Cloud Vision skill.

12
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,630
But

13
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,990
it's also cost us dearly.

14
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,040
You've been gifted since childhood

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
and are the sole heir of this skill.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,790
You must pass it down,

17
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,300
but don't reveal it easily.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,650
(Lin Jiang, Master of Cloud Vision)

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,710
Do you understand?

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,880
Three.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
Now four.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Well.

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,510
Some people see it as jade,

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,000
while others take it for a stone.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,280
Whatever it's worth,

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,120
it's not as important as our happiness.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Read the Stone Appraisal Manual
when you get back.

28
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,940
- Lin! Lin!
- Grandpa!

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,840
- Don't run!
- Stop there!

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
You little brat.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
Don't you run!

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,000
It took me a while to catch you.

33
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,100
(18 years later)

34
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,780
(Jade Street)

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,620
- He guessed right again.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,960
That's amazing.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,670
It seems to be another profitable cut.

38
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,470
It is.

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,140
(Shi Lai)

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,260
(Gu Yunmiao, Heiress of the Gu Family)
Miss, he has opened three raw stones.

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,800
(General Manager of Feishang Group)
And they're all good ones.

42
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,670
A group of good-for-nothings.

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,780
(Vendor Zhang, Merchant on Jade Street)
You've blocked my door.

44
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,620
Get lost!

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,190
I'll take this one.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,190
I spotted this stone first.

47
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,190
Who said you spotted it first?

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,470
I had my eye on it long ago.

49
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,590
Now that I see it,

50
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,030
it's not that good.

51
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,030
I'll let you have it.

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,190
Don't hide it, Boss.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,880
By your pants leg.

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,480
There's still good stuff?

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,650
- Take it out.
- Where is it?

56
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,470
Take it out, Boss.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,310
Boss, take it out now.

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,310
Boss, hurry up.

59
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,150
Come on.

60
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,900
There really is.

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,220
You've got a sharp eye, young man.

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,020
Weigh it.

63
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,740
Charge it at 200 yuan per kilo.

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,020
I'll offer 300 yuan.

65
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,260
I spotted this one first.

66
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,500
It's business.

67
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,450
Whoever offers the best price gets it.

68
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,450
Right, Boss?

69
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,340
I'll offer 350 yuan.

70
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,620
I'll offer 500 yuan.

71
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,660
Deal.

72
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,500
500 yuan.

73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,810
Such a high price.

74
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,020
Cut it!

75
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,180
That's it?

76
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,460
- How dare you fool me!
- He's beating him up.

77
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Wait a moment!

78
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
I am

79
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,340
Miss Gu Yunmiao's friend.

80
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,750
What?

81
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,220
How could you possibly know Miss Gu?

82
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,900
You don't believe me?

83
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,020
You can call Miss Gu

84
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,460
if you don't.

85
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,900
No way.

86
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,420
You don't even have
Miss Gu's number, do you?

87
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,370
- No way.
- No way.

88
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,460
How dare you mess with Miss Gu's friend?

89
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,260
Don't do this next time.

90
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,060
Hello,

91
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,060
my friend.

92
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,780
You are…?

93
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,980
My surname is Gu.

94
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,620
Miss… Miss Gu.

95
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,310
I knew he didn't know Miss Gu.

96
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,410
Miss Gu, he dared to

97
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,660
pretend to be your friend.

98
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,920
I'll take care of him

99
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,060
so you don't have to see him.

100
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,690
It's been a long time since I came here.

101
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,540
Since when do people

102
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,190
rule the Jade Street by fighting?

103
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,580
It's not like that.

104
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,140
Your family dominates

105
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,450
half of the raw stone market
in Yongjing.

106
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,900
The entire Jade Street

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,110
is in your charge.

108
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,240
Well, it's stone gambling.

109
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,340
You win some, you lose some.

110
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,700
If you lose money,

111
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,970
don't break the rules.

112
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,470
Well said.

113
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
Miss Gu, right?

114
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,500
Thank you.

115
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,340
You pretended to be my friend.

116
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,540
How should you

117
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,380
explain it to me?

118
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,300
Actually, I saw it.

119
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,620
You lied to him, didn't you?

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
He's overbearing

121
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,220
and bullies the weak.

122
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,300
People like him deserve it.

123
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,340
Exactly.

124
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,980
But

125
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,300
how did you know about
the stone under his feet?

126
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,420
Well, thank you.

127
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,220
I was just a bit lucky.

128
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,440
I have to go.

129
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,610
- Let's go.
- Interesting.

130
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,980
(Zhang Qi, Secretary of Feishang Group)
Miss, I'll go check it out.

131
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,820
Good.

132
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,460
4,500.

133
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,660
4,600.

134
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,460
(Old Man Shi, Shi Lai's Foster Father)

135
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,620
And the 500.

136
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,700
- Nice.
- All right.

137
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,620
Dad.

138
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,690
Don't just giggle.

139
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,300
You've got some acting to do.

140
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,760
The bottom line is,

141
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,420
when that big guy
was about to beat me up,

142
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,660
you shouldn't have panicked.

143
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,390
You've got to control yourself.

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,650
If you got flustered too,
we'd be exposed.

145
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,780
- Think about it.
- Alright.

146
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,100
So you're swindlers.

147
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,720
What swindling? It's called acting…

148
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,860
I didn't realize my friend was an actor.

149
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,220
I won't allow bullying or pitfalls

150
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,060
on Jade Street.

151
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,980
We didn't force him to spend any money.

152
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,300
He insisted on paying.

153
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,780
Yeah.

154
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,060
You said

155
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,180
he's overbearing

156
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
and bullies the weak.

157
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,420
People like him deserve it.

158
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,260
Yeah.

159
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,300
Don't worry, we don't
screw over passersby.

160
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,380
Yeah.

161
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,590
A swindler's guarantee.

162
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,440
How ridiculous!

163
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,660
The three stones you just cut open

164
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,190
were prepared in advance too, right?

165
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,180
You look like a decent person.

166
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
But who would have thought
you were a fraud?

167
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,920
Don't be so harsh.

168
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,300
How do you know he doesn't
have real skills?

169
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,420
(Don't you know if I have real skills?)

170
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,260
All right then.

171
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,220
If you're any good,

172
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,620
prove it to me.

173
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,140
Otherwise,

174
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,980
I'll have you taken
to the police station.

175
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,220
Miss.

176
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,660
My friend is here to pick out a stone.

177
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,460
Miss Gu, your presence

178
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,300
honors my humble shop.

179
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,420
All right. All right.

180
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,300
Dad,

181
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,540
you've got to help me later.

182
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,540
I'm counting on you.

183
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,540
No problem. Just watch.

184
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,380
Shi Lai.

185
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,220
This one has

186
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,430
a fine and smooth surface on its rind

187
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,300
and it's cracked.

188
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,580
You can see the color.

189
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,720
Nice transparency.

190
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,770
Unfortunately,

191
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,690
it's too light.

192
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,740
Only the outer layer can produce jade.

193
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,220
It's waste material inside.

194
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,300
Pretentious.

195
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,620
You're a charlatan.

196
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,220
Jade Street is full of people like you.

197
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,100
This one

198
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,460
has a hard and fine

199
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,300
rind texture.

200
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,860
But it's just waxy jade material.

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,540
And the tapping sound is sharp.

202
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,020
There are also horse-tail
fissures in it.

203
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,220
It's also a waste material

204
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,060
of little value.

205
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,660
This one…

206
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,660
(Where is he?)

207
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,020
(Dad.)

208
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,060
(You're going to get me killed
with your nap today.)

209
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,540
Do you know how to
appraise stones or not?

210
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,600
You look like a swindler
stalling for time.

211
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,820
Can you feel it?

212
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,780
This is the one.

213
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,670
Miss, this stone is not only rough,

214
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,320
but judging from the pattern
on the rind,

215
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,100
it's probably from Yishan,
a new mining area.

216
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,580
That area hasn't produced
any high-priced jade yet…

217
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,420
Cut it.

218
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,340
I'd like to see

219
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,820
how much he can do.

220
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,180
Glassy species jadeite.

221
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,680
- (Luckily, it didn't turn out to be a flop.)
- Miss.

222
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,800
It's actually glassy jadeite.

223
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,150
There's such a large piece of jade.

224
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,920
At least three bracelets
can be made from it.

225
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,110
Kid.

226
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,540
Don't get cocky too soon.

227
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,900
(I didn't expect him
to be this capable.)

228
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,300
Dad.

229
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,140
It's all your fault.

230
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,060
I'd be doomed

231
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,990
if it hadn't been for
my good luck and illusion.

232
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,100
You're always lazy
when I teach you stone appraisal.

233
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,840
How can you hit him?

234
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,940
- Get lost.
- What are you doing?

235
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,300
You two were acting in concert.

236
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,220
Acting in concert!

237
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,230
Lay still. Don't move.

238
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,840
This is the price of you playing tricks.

239
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,940
Acting in concert!

240
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,220
I've been on Jade Street for years.

241
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,310
You're the first one
who's fooled me like this.

242
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,740
You've got a smart mouth, huh?

243
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,380
I thought you were a stone appraiser.

244
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
I'll chop off your finger today

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,730
and see how you'll
appraise stones in the future.
