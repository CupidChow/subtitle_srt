00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,200
Miss Linda, can I borrow

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,560
a flame from you?

5
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,380
(Manual)

6
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,240
(Some raw stones are cleverly faked,)

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,750
(wrapped in two layers of skin,)

8
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,630
(making it hard
to assess their internal quality.)

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,790
(In such cases,)

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,020
(you can)

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
(heat the skin with fire,)

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,950
(then cool it with cold water.)

13
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,150
(The skin will peel off,)

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,350
(revealing)

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,280
(the true nature of the stone inside.)

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,500
Using fire to roast jade
should leave no cracks;

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,200
if there are cracks, you can see the base.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,480
I've heard of using fire for faking,

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,400
but this is the first time I've seen it

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,940
used for authenticating stones.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,270
It's just a bunch of nonsense!

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,040
This stone contains

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,600
gold thread jade,

24
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,000
but unfortunately,
the internal structure is loose

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,410
and there are many jade veins,

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,950
making it hard to open high-quality jade.

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,400
Boss, it is indeed gold thread jade.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,680
On the surface, it looks fine,

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,150
but inside, there are too many jade veins,

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,990
so it's not valuable.

31
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,790
(This brat really did guess it right.)

32
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,100
Mr. Liu,

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,440
you're always welcome to visit again.

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,400
The Jade Bar welcomes everyone.

35
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,910
Young Master Liu?

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I accept my loss!

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,350
Mr. Shi,

38
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,790
would you like to have a drink with me?

39
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,000
This one is the most valuable.

40
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,310
If this one opens badly,

41
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,430
I'll have to...

42
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,150
Back out?

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,710
No.

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,030
To meet Mr. Shi,

45
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,870
that's the greatest value

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,960
this stone has.

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,540
I don't drink.

48
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,430
I'm sorry!

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,270
Really sorry!

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,750
I'll handle it myself.

51
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,460
By the way...

52
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,840
when will you be able to get me the pass?

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,570
Tomorrow at 10 a.m. I'll come find you.

54
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,650
Okay, see you then!

55
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,430
The exit is on the other side.

56
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,030
(I thought he was a fierce tiger,)

57
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,590
(but it turns out)

58
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,280
(he's a little lamb.)

59
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,870
Foolish!

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,840
You couldn't even handle
double-layered stone skins!

61
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,710
How did you learn from me?

62
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,590
It was that Shi Lai

63
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,750
who used some trick I don't know!

64
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,870
He only has one trick—

65
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,310
he's better than you!

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
What?

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,840
Shi Lai?

68
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,750
Some country bumpkin
who popped up from nowhere.

69
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,910
Dad,

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,750
do you know him?

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,040
Lin Jiang's grandson, Lin Yun, was found.

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,160
His name is Shi Lai.

73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
A wild brat

74
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,160
who's not even worth my pinky.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,310
Let me show him who's boss!

76
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,040
You rely too much on your skills

77
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,160
and get cocky!

78
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,720
How many times do I need to teach you?

79
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
The highest level in stone gambling

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
isn't technique—

81
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,040
it's understanding the human heart.

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,040
You're not manipulating stones,

83
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,040
you're manipulating people's minds.

84
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,480
Do your job,

85
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,190
and don't cause trouble

86
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,070
until we find out Shi Lai's background!

87
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,600
Get in the car.

88
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,580
Miss Linda,

89
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,790
sorry about

90
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,030
the scarf

91
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,560
the other day.

92
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,310
I've already washed it.

93
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,350
It's fine.

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,210
Consider it

95
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,110
a gift.

96
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,390
That jade you helped me with yesterday

97
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,950
turned out to be a glassy jadeite,

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,790
and it was made into jewelry

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
worth three million yuan.

100
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,630
Give me a hand.

101
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,030
OK.

102
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,870
Sorry, I was careless.

103
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,190
Well... congratulations, Miss Linda.

104
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,190
About that pass...

105
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,110
I don't have it.

106
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,040
No?

107
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,630
But you promised me.

108
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,630
I only promised

109
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,830
to help you get a pass,

110
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,040
not to give it to you directly.

111
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,630
Is this how you do business?

112
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,950
I'm just an information broker.

113
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,070
How you acquire

114
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,510
and use the information

115
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,510
is up to you.

116
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,070
Alright, let's talk about the information.

117
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,190
The only one who can help you get the pass

118
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,190
is Feishang Group's

119
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,470
Master Nine.

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,310
If I could get the pass from him,

121
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,270
I would've done so by now.

122
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,720
Don't rush.

123
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,910
There's more.

124
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,030
I just

125
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,910
need to find...

126
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
her?

127
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,620
(Feishang Group)

128
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,750
Shi Lai?

129
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,510
I was looking for him.

130
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,740
(Miss Gu Yunmiao of the Gu Family )
My three million!

131
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,670
Shi Lai.

132
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,830
Miss Gu, hello.

133
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,460
(Pass to the Yongjing Private Club)

134
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,670
Here.

135
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,190
Thank you, Miss Gu.

136
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,110
No need to thank me.

137
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
A favor

138
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,720
between friends.

139
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,180
If something happens to me,

140
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,600
you'll help me,

141
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,670
won't you?

142
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,670
Of course.

143
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,790
Coincidentally,

144
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,720
our Feishang Group is planning

145
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,940
to import a batch of raw stones.

146
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
I'd like you to help me assess the samples.

147
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,600
Of course,

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,090
I'll pay you more than the market price

149
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,160
for your assessment fee.

150
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,190
I don't do stone appraisals

151
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,270
for money.

152
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,720
It's to punish the wicked and promote good.

153
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,030
The only reason I'm getting involved
in the Club

154
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,530
is because I have no other choice.

155
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,110
Alright.

156
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,390
You got the pass. You forgot your friends!

157
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,390
You'll just stand by
and watch me get cheated?

158
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,510
Didn't we just say

159
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
friends

160
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,270
should help

161
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,630
each other out?

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
Men

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,510
- are so untrustworthy!
- Fine!

164
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,380
I'll help you as a friend.

165
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,950
Miaomiao!

166
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,680
Hi, Jingzhao!

167
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,060
(Lu Jingzhao, Young Master of Lu Group)

168
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,080
Aren't you going to introduce us?

169
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,140
This is my friend,

170
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,980
Shi Lai.

171
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,320
Hello.

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
Miaomiao,

173
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
this is a piece of rough material
I picked out

174
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,160
specifically from the quarry.

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Feel it.

176
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Just feel it.

177
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,160
Look,

178
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,320
the skin has pure color,

179
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
and you can see the red mist.

180
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,080
I've already had it assessed,

181
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,120
and it's likely to open into red jade.

182
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,480
I paid three million yuan for it.

183
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
If you like it,

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,670
I'll give it to you.

185
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,020
Giving away a piece of inferior material
as a gift

186
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,550
isn't very polite, is it?

187
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,080
There is indeed

188
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
some red jade in this,

189
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
but the color is very dark,

190
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,810
and there's too much impurity inside.

191
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,330
It's not transparent at all.

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
It's not worth three million.

193
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,960
At most, it would only open into

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
a few hundred thousand.

195
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,960
What would you know,

196
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,600
you country bumpkin?

197
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Acting

198
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,020
like an expert?

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,960
Who do you think you are?

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm your...

201
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
He's my boyfriend!

202
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
You?

203
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
Come on, Miaomiao,

204
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,960
don't joke around.

205
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,200
How low have you sunk

206
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,720
to pick a boyfriend from the garbage bin?

207
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,960
Lu Jingzhao, don't go too far!

208
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
He's my boyfriend,

209
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,790
I decide who he is.

210
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,360
You have no right to tell me otherwise!

211
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
Miaomiao,

212
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,080
let's get away from this mess

213
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,790
and get some fresh air.

214
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,630
Alright!

215
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,720
Nice acting!

216
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,200
I worry he's trying to take advantage of me.

217
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,670
You know what I mean, right?

218
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,440
Of course, we're friends.

219
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,390
But Jingzhao

220
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,720
will definitely take it seriously.

221
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,960
You kind of confirmed it just now.

222
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,550
So you have to take responsibility.

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,910
What do you want me to do?

224
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,600
At least pretend to be my stone appraiser

225
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,440
until the private club event.

226
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,200
Otherwise, I'll lose face!

227
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,080
You're taking advantage of me!

228
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
Business is business.

229
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,670
If you don't agree,

230
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,440
I'll cancel your pass to the Club.

231
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
Fine, Miss Gu,

232
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,480
but only for the event day.

233
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
One more thing.

234
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,480
Don't call me Miss Gu from now on.

235
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Call me Miaomiao.

236
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
Miao...

237
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Miaomiao?

238
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,390
Miaomiao.

239
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,620
(Lu's Mansion)

240
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Brother,

241
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,240
I've pursued Miaomiao for so long,

242
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,200
and every time I carefully choose gifts,

243
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,200
yet I don't understand

244
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,420
why she never accepts them.

245
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
And why does she like that useless guy?

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
Yeah,

247
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,960
how could Miss Gu

248
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,360
like someone useless?

249
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,720
She's been blinded.

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,160
After eating too much delicacy,

251
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,320
she's looking for a change
with the wild grass.

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
He's Lin Jiang's missing grandson.

253
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
In just a few days,

254
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,840
he's already gained the recognition
of both Master Nine

255
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,650
and the Jade Bar in Yongjing.

256
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
It looks like

257
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,790
he's about to enter the raw stone circle.

258
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,600
What... What?

259
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,800
Jingzhao,

260
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,600
the raw stone world is all about
survival of the fittest.

261
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,240
Your job is to make sure the wild grass

262
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,480
stays wild.

263
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,920
Brother,

264
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
don't worry.

265
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,600
I'll make sure he doesn't rise.

266
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,420
(Yongjing Private Club
Stone Appraisal Competition)

267
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,320
Wait for me there.

268
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Miss Gu, let me go pick him up.

269
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,670
I'll pick him up myself.

270
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,720
Shows more sincerity.

271
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,600
Do you like him, Miss?

272
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
Miaomiao.

273
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,560
Look

274
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
who I have invited.

275
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,720
Master Dai.

276
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,200
Master Dai is the expert

277
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,320
I've invited today.

278
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,120
Miss Gu.

279
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,600
I didn't know a master like you

280
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,720
would work for the Lu Family.

281
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,220
They show deep sincerity.

282
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,480
I couldn't always turn them down.

283
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,340
I'm picking up a friend.

284
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,440
Excuse me.

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Just stay there.

286
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,690
I'm coming.

287
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,760
Okay.

288
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,080
Shi Lai,

289
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,960
you really got the pass.

290
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,840
What are you doing here?

291
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,960
My Jade Bar also has shares in the Club,

292
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,080
and they asked me to host the event.

293
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,960
So you could've got me the pass all along?

294
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,480
Why didn't you help me then?

295
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,720
Don't be so upset.

296
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,380
I have my reasons

297
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,480
for handling things this way.

298
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,200
Also, I have some information for you.

299
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
Want to hear it?

300
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,480
No, no, it's too expensive.

301
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,950
Don't worry,

302
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,320
this one's free.

303
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,980
Your opponent today

304
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,380
is one of the greatest
in the stone appraisal world,

305
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,040
Master Dai Yifei.

306
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
Master Dai?

307
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,120
He's been retired for years.

308
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
Who could have invited him?

309
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,920
I did.

310
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,920
You?

311
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,910
Master Dai isn't interested
in fame or fortune,

312
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
but there's one thing

313
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
he loves—ancient jade.

314
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,720
I sold that information

315
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,200
to the Lu family.

316
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,200
That wasn't cheap, was it?

317
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,910
It wasn't cheap,

318
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
but it's very important.

319
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,080
In the future,

320
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,910
we could work together.
