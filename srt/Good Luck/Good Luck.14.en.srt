00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,030
The massage felt so good,
I'm getting sleepy.

4
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,870
I'll go take a nap for a bit.

5
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm here to discuss a collaboration.

6
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,480
You should have some tea, Young Master.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh, right.

8
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,630
Well,

9
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,310
looks like today isn't the right time.

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,280
I'll come back another day.

11
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,230
Qiao Na, your tea-making skills
are getting better and better.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
Shi Lai, the weather is so nice.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,240
Let's go for a walk.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,120
I have something I want to tell you.

15
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,680
Sorry, Miss Gu!

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,310
Young Master needs to rest!

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,150
He should still move around a little.

18
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,990
Miss Gu,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,280
his injuries haven't healed yet.

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,120
Please be careful.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,430
We wouldn't want Young Master
to get hurt again for you!

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,560
He risked his life to save me.

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,510
Of course, I need to thank him properly.

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,920
As for you, as his secretary,

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
you should know your place.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Miss Gu, I'm just doing my job.

27
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,280
If you really care about him,

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
you should avoid causing him more trouble.

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,280
- You...!
- I...!

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,480
Please calm down.

31
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,790
Qiao Na, how about
making another pot of tea for me?

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,590
- Okay, Young Master.
- Thanks.

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,040
Miaomiao, you had something
to talk to me about?

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,000
Almost forgot. It makes me so angry.

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,150
Lu Jingzhao fabricated an alibi!

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,560
Without evidence,
we can't do anything about it.

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,740
Miaomiao, be patient.

38
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,840
We're law-abiding citizens.

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Don't worry. I'll help you get justice.

40
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,640
- I promise!
- You promise?

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,600
Yep.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,030
From now on,
I'll practice boxing every day.

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,150
If there's a next time,

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,310
watch how I turn him into a cowardly turtle!

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
What's wrong?

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
- Come with me to Jade Street for a walk.
- No, no, no!

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,220
(Shiyuan Cabin)

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Come, everyone,

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
judge for yourselves!

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,910
I bought this raw stone
from Feishang Group,

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,190
and after cutting it, it's fake!

52
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,400
- This stone?
- A fake one?

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,120
Look, the outer skin looks real,

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,630
but inside it's just marble!

55
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,430
Isn't this fraud?

56
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,040
This is the big shop bullying customers!

57
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,560
I didn't expect the Gu family
to start selling fake goods too!

58
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,360
No, we run an honest business.

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
There's no such thing!

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,840
- Stop lying!
- Everyone,

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,310
we've always operated with integrity!

62
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,030
Who is making this nonsense?

63
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,470
Miss Gu,

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,190
this raw stone was bought

65
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,840
from your Feishang Group's store.

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,840
After cutting it,
we found it was fake jade.

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,910
How do you plan to resolve this?

68
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,590
Let me take a look.

69
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,030
Selling fake stones?

70
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,150
Scammers!

71
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,590
Scammers!

72
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,240
So?

73
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,590
The outer skin is yellow-red,

74
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,000
thick,

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,680
smooth, and delicate,

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,750
with an oily sheen.

77
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,520
It definitely came from
the Longshan quarry.

78
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
So you admit it?

79
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,150
Longshan is a new quarry,

80
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,360
and your group is the only partner
in the country.

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
No.

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
Someone took the raw stone from Longshan,
stripped off the outer skin,

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,840
and intentionally wrapped it
around artificial marble

84
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,870
to create fake raw stones

85
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,360
to sell on the market,

86
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
framing Feishang Group.

87
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,520
Nonsense!

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,970
Stop acting!

89
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
Miss Gu,

90
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,710
didn't your group say
you'd compensate ten times for fakes?

91
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,520
I spent a million on this raw stone.

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Shouldn't you be paying me
ten million now?

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,310
- That's right!
- Pay him!

94
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,310
Pay him!

95
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,400
Pay him!

96
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,870
Enough!

97
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,360
This is

98
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,750
a setup.

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Once we investigate

100
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
and find the mastermind,

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
we will give everyone an explanation.

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,750
Trying to dodge responsibility, huh?

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Isn't it typical

104
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,430
for the Gu family to rely on

105
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,430
scams to get ahead?

106
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,870
Looks like you're back to your old tricks!

107
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,270
You're talking nonsense!

108
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,070
Miaomiao, leave this to me.

109
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,910
None of your business!

110
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,190
I'm talking to Miss Gu!

111
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,000
You really don't know whose turf you're on?

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You dare to stir trouble here!

113
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,920
Scaring me?

114
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,390
Everyone, look!

115
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,310
The Gu family is using their power

116
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
to bully others!

117
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
Everyone, look!

118
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,560
This habitual scammer, Chen Laojing!

119
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,070
What are you saying?

120
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,160
Your real name is Chen Gang,

121
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,270
nickname "Chen Laojing",

122
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,400
a thug from the old days.

123
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,920
You made a living

124
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,680
by scamming people,

125
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,680
and were imprisoned
for three years for fraud.

126
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,160
You just got out last year,

127
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,210
- and now you're back to your old tricks.
- You...!

128
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,440
- Come, everyone, take a good look!
- So he's a scammer!

129
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,750
I knew

130
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,240
Feishang Group never sold fake goods!

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,120
How embarrassing!

132
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,670
Take a picture!

133
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,000
Stop taking pictures!

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
Stop filming!

135
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,910
Just stop!

136
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,190
Didn't you ask everyone
to come over and look?

137
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,560
Wait for it! You'll regret this!

138
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,270
Stop filming!

139
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,800
Stop!

140
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,270
Don't run!

141
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,520
Don't leave!

142
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,120
How did you know

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,630
that guy was a habitual scammer?

144
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,880
- I...
- Wait a second.

145
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,070
You didn't go ask someone
for information, did you?

146
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,040
- I did.
- Was it Linda?

147
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
Yeah, I just called her.

148
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,630
She's my partner,

149
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,750
just helping me

150
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,630
with a small favor.

151
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,110
No way,

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
you'll have to pay for this information.

153
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't have money.

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,080
I'll pay!

155
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,120
By the way, that thug

156
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,040
didn't have the skills

157
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,830
to make such a high-quality fake.

158
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,960
Look at

159
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,880
these seams.

160
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,360
It's clear that an expert worked on this
and applied dyeing techniques.

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,240
This dyeing and stitching technique,

162
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,080
I've seen it before.

163
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,680
It was

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,620
before Lin went to Gumie.

165
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,360
Lin had uncovered a merchant's fraud,

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,350
and the same technique was used.

167
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,320
I heard that merchant had backing
from someone in Jade Society.

168
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,310
At the time, the merchant warned Lin

169
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,950
not to meddle,

170
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,190
but with Lin's temperament,

171
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,360
he was determined to expose it.

172
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,650
Again, Jade Society?

173
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,720
The old foxes in Jade Society

174
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,360
hide deep.

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,240
After the scandal broke,

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,650
the merchant vanished.

177
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,350
I didn't expect

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,120
this dyeing technique

179
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,360
to show up again.

180
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,030
Grandpa,

181
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,600
this time they're targeting the Gu family.

182
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,870
I suspect the three big families
in Jade Society

183
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,000
are trying to team up

184
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,240
against us.

185
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,270
(This could be related
to Grandpa's disappearance.)

186
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
(I have to go to Jade Street)

187
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,630
(and figure out
where these fake stones came from.)

188
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,870
(What a coincidence…)

189
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,270
(Something's fishy.)

190
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,240
(The competition)

191
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,290
(is really tough these days.)

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,950
- Boss.
- Boss.

193
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,350
Hello?

194
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,950
Don't worry.

195
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,350
No problem.

196
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,310
My Liu Xinchen's replica Longshan skin

197
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,600
will definitely be undetectable.

198
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
So it's the Liu family causing trouble.

199
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,230
No worries!

200
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Who's there?

201
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,920
Get him!

202
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,070
- Don't let him get away!
- Yes!

203
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,270
Stop him!

204
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,880
Are you sure I can count on you two?

205
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
Miss,

206
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,120
we're professional extras.

207
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,730
Sixty yuan.

208
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,580
Add twenty for lines.

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,910
Don't overdo it.

210
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,470
Of course!

211
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,600
He's coming! That direction!

212
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,550
Take them.

213
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,810
Linda?

214
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,910
Finally, this chick's quiet.

215
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,550
Once the drug takes effect,

216
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,090
we'll see a good show.

217
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,550
After this job,

218
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,910
we'll be rich!

219
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,160
Do it!

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,450
(Linda's been kidnapped?)

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
(No signal.)

222
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
(They have the advantage in numbers,)

223
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,790
(I don't stand a chance.)

224
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,390
(What should I do?)

225
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,390
(Right!)

226
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,390
Where's the old man?

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,040
What old man?

228
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,270
Where is the old man?!

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,240
I don't know!

230
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,750
Don't run!

231
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Run!

232
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,390
Stop!

233
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,590
Miss Linda,

234
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,470
are you okay?

235
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,550
Linda. Linda. Linda!

236
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,750
I don't know how to drive this van!

237
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,990
Stop!

238
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,750
Don't run!

239
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Stop!

240
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,200
No. No!

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,360
What's wrong with this van?

242
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
- He's over there!
- Hurry!

243
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,270
Let's go get him!

244
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,040
Don't run!

245
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,180
Stop!

246
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,130
Park the van!

247
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,840
This van's so hard to drive!

248
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,630
Finally stopped.

249
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,150
Still no signal?

250
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,870
Hello?

251
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,990
Qiao Na,

252
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,920
I'm in trouble,

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
come pick me up.

254
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm near Yunxia Road,

255
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,150
by the river.

256
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,110
Okay.

257
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,040
Hurry.

258
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,600
Miss Linda, you're awake.

259
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,510
