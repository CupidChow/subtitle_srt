Once, I had a genuine

invitation

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,090
but didn't cherish it.

6
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,750
Now that I've lost it,
I regret it deeply.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,520
Sister, I was wrong!

00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,760
(The listening test is about to start.)

10
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,560
(All candidates, please get ready.)

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,660
(Why is there a listening test?)

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
(Whatever.)

13
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,560
(After spending so many years
on Jade Street,)

14
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,840

(than a bunch of students.)

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,790
Many foreign countries are attracted
by China's jade

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,920
and come to China to buy jade.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,790
During this process,

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
they will encounter many questions.

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,070
Please give answers
according to the questions.

21
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,510
I finally understand

22
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,920
why people avoid this exam

23
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,280
and look for shortcuts.

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Time to pull ahead!

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,280
What is the primary

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
mineral composition of dry green jade?

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,800
The answer with the most words
is likely correct.

29
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,240
There is a colorless,
non-homogeneous faceted gem

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,870

a density of 3 g/cm³,

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,910
a hardness of 7,

33
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,310
and an incomplete dissociation…

34
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,680
I know every word,

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,520
but the combination makes no sense.

36

Sir,

37
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
can you please stop standing behind me?

38
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
You're making me nervous.

39
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,910
No sounds,

40
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,630
no communication with the proctor,

41
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,190
or it will be considered cheating!

42
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
Okay.

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,360

Agreed.

I'm unqualified

take the official exam.

57

I really am unqualified.

Shi Lai!

70
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,310
Does this fit?

71
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,510
I had it custom-made for you.

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,080
We're wearing the same outfit.

73
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,350

74

I'll change.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
It's work attire,

76
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,630
it's the same for everyone.

77
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,120
- The client is almost here. Hurry.
- Come on!

85

Wait a second.

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
This rough stone

87
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,070
looks like a valuable yellow sand jade,

88
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,310
but the yellow on the surface

89
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,560
was actually dyed.

90
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,430
The green here is a result of polishing.

91
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,370
Choosing this would definitely
be a losing deal.

92
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
No way,

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,390
the raw stones Feishang Group buys

94
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,920

by in-house stone appraisers.

- Look.
- It's really fake!

96

wouldn't miss this.

faked it.

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,680
I can't wait to see

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,850
the results after the stone is cut.

118
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,910
To be honest,

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm also curious.

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Miss!

121
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,350
The result isn't good!

122
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
It's dark green jade,

123
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,060
the transparency is very poor,

124
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,610
and there are
several chicken claw fissures.

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,310
It's only worth a few dozen thousand.

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,190
Miss, after Shi Lai left last night,

127
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,270
he went to the Lu family.

128
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,180
(Welcome to Lu Group)

129
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,870
You've only known him for a short time.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,120
The Master specifically warned
not to let him participate again.

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,730
If he really has connections
with the Lu family…

132
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,310
That's not possible!
Shi Lai isn't like that.

133
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,190
I believe him.

134
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,120
Fake!

135
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,320
- This is fake!
- What?

136
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,360
Boss, there's an old cut.

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,000
This rough stone
was definitely cut before.

138
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,550
Someone discovered it wasn't good jade

139
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,360
and wrapped it in fake skin.

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,670
This is a forgery!

141
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,870
The surface is dyed blue and thinned,

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,550
making it look like foggy blue,

143
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,240
tricking people into thinking
it's blue water jade.

144
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
Miss Gu,

145
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,360
are you trying to deceive an old customer

146
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
with this fake stone?

147
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,870
I paid fifty million!

148
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,320
What kind of stone is this?

149
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,750
Is this Crazy Stone?

150
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,080
It clearly says tenfold compensation.

151
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Mr. Yan…

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,440
I'm suing Feishang Group now!

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,320
Mr. Yan, please calm down.

154
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
If it's really our fault,

155
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,550
I'll take full responsibility

156
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,750
and give you a satisfactory answer.

157
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Fine.

158
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,470
What will you do about it?

159
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,750
(It's indeed a fake,)

160
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,870
(but what I saw before wasn't like this.)

161
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
(Could it be…)

162
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,230
Miss,

163
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
he must be the one behind it!

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,120
Why still pretending?

165
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,720
I warned you,
he's in cahoots with the Lu family.

166
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,510
Miaomiao, you have to believe me,
I didn't deceive you!

167
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,350
Say no more.

168
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
Just leave.

169
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,140
Miss, don't let him go!

170
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,520
We have to call the police
and arrest him!

171
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Shut up!

172
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,350
Let him go.

173
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,440
I'll only give you this one chance!

174
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,120
Even if he tries to fool everyone,

175
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,510
he won't dare
to openly take the real stone.

176
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,630
So the real stone

177
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,630
is still in the company.

178
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,000
They'll definitely

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,630
come to take it tonight.

180
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,550
Shi Lai!

181
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,390
I have no patience to watch this act!

182
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,240
- Miss Gu.
- Mr. Yan.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
You kicked him out,

184
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,390
and now you're here with him,
making me wait?

185
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,510
It's hard for me to trust you now!

186
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,910
Please, give us a little more time!

187
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,860
I don't want to hear it!

188
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,230
- Please.
- Wait!

189
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,350
There he is.

190
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,440
What's going on? Stop right there!

191
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,360
There's a fake rough stone hidden here.

192
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,590
While we weren't around,
they swapped it out.

193
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,910
Just cut open this rough stone,

194
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,240
and you'll see

195
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
if I'm telling the truth.

196
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,030
This is such a brilliant,
translucent blue water jade!

197
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,100
It's...

198
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,390
- It's...
- I knew it!

199
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Azure Jade!

200
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,470
It's Azure Jade!

201
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,630
Still…

202
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,790
- thank you, Miss Gu, for believing me.
- It can be sold for 200 million!

203
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,990
- Otherwise, I would've been kicked out.
- This is sky-high!

204
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,630
- I apologize.
- What a fortune!

205
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,170
- I shouldn't have doubted you earlier.
- What a fortune!

206
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,150
But I promise,

207
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,750
the certification

208
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,870
will be handled by me.

209
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,750
This is a sincere apology.

210
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,590
But,

211
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,150
this time, thanks to Linda.

212
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,120
Miss Linda,

213
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,510
I still don't fully trust you.

214
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,000
How about this time

215
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,270
we just do a straightforward transaction?

216
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,750
You know the story
of the cat switching the prince?

217
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,910
Be careful of Lu Jinghui.

218
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,510
I can't believe it's him behind all this.

219
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,750
In any case, you don't believe me.
I'm leaving.

220
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,390
Stop, stop!

221
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,120
I was wrong, I was wrong!

222
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,270
What do you want to eat? It's on me.

223
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,150
Then transfer me five million first.

224
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,120
What do you want to eat
that's so expensive?

225
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,390
What a fortune!

226
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,870
What a fortune!

227
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,670
What's Cloud Vision?

228
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,150
Eyes, hands, ears, nose, and heart –

229
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,360
only with all five senses

230
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,630
can one appreciate

231
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,670
its delicate texture,

232
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,750
vivid colors,

233
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,750
and intricate patterns.

234
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,870
Doesn't this sound just like the opening

235
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,240
of the stone appraisal beginner's guide?

236
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,120
How are things on your side?

237
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,910
He still refuses to cooperate with me.

238
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,510
Normally you get things done easily,

239
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,120
why did you fail this time?

240
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,240
You took the secret manual first,

241
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,910
so it's understandable that
Shi Lai doesn't want to cooperate.

242
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,630
Linda, what are you going to do next?

243
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,120
We don't need to act now.

244
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,390
The Jade Society will take care of him.

245
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,270
They won't let Shi Lai go.

246
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,030
He'll

247
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,670
come to me himself soon enough.

248
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,750
Hurt him,

249
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,910
then help him.

250
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,360
Hurt him again,

251
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,510
then help him again.

252
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,240
Who can withstand your moves?

253
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,630
I don't care,

254
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,630
I will get that five million back

255
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,030
one day!

256
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,510
Yes, yes.

257
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,910
Such a money lover.

258
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,440
What?

259
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm a money lover?

260
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,630
Fine,

261
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,390
whatever you say.

262
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,120
But,

263
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,390
you should know

264
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,750
though I love money,

265
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,440
I always keep my words!

266
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,150
- Alright.
- Once I speak,

267
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,630
my grandpa will definitely agree
to give you the certification.

268
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,030
You've said it
several times already, Miaomiao.

269
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,150
Shi Lai.

270
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,440
I want to go to Gumie with you.

271
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,030
You're going for your grandpa,

272
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,120
and I'm going for my mom.

273
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,470
How so?

274
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,150
I want to find her relics,

275
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,630
the Lotus Jade.

276
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,510
Lotus Jade?

277
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,270
Shi Lai,

278
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,000
you're so cute!

279
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,510
Miss!

280
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,270
You've had too much to drink again.

281
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,030
Hurry and take her home.

282
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,030
Mr. Shi, aren't you coming with us?

283
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,670
No need. Qiao Na will come pick me up.

284
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,790
Alright, please be safe!

285
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,750
I will.

286
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,630
Be careful!

287
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,750
Be careful, Miss.

288
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,870
When did you ever see me drunk?

289
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,910
Didn't he ask me to come pick him up?

290
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,240
Why isn't he answering the phone?

291
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,270
Is something wrong?

292
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,980
(Shanhe Hotel)

293
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,840
Hotel?

294
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,990
Where…

295
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,790
where am I?

296
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
Boss,

297
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,510
I've got him.

298
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,150
But he threw up all over me,

299
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,720
it's disgusting!

300
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,670
You'll have to pay me more.

301
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,870
A honey trap?

302
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,390
Who's there?

303
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,870
What's going on?

304
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,710
I feel so hot all over!

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,820
I saw him running this way…

306
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,390
Keep looking!

307
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,870
Who are they?

308
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,230
I have no idea.

309
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,840
He shouldn't have gone too far.

310
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,390
Don't move.

311
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,510
Looks like he ran that way!

312
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,350
Got it!

313
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,230
Chase him!

314
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,200
What's wrong?

315
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,350
How are you feeling?

316
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,720
I called you so many times,
but you didn't answer.

317
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,150
Luckily, I tracked your phone.

318
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,270
I don't know.

319
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,150
I was suddenly knocked out,

320
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,510
and when I woke up, I was here.

321
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you have a fever?

322
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,840
