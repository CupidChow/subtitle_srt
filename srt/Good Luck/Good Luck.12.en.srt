00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,000
Is this…

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
the Glassy Golden Silk variety?

5
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,350
It's the Glassy Golden Silk variety!

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,400
Everyone,

7
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,000
this is a once-in-a-century find!

8
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,910
Oh my God!

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,230
- It's worth a fortune!
- I heard

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,430
that in the 2007 Gumie Public Auction,

11
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,760
a Golden Silk raw stone

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
was already priced over 80 million!

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
80 million?

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
That was the price 17 years ago!

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,480
Shi Lai wins this round!

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,350
I announce

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,950
that the final winner is…

18
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:28,990
Shi Lai!

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,510
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,960
No way!

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,840
Don't leave in a rush, Master Zhou.

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,300
Aren't you going to charge
for your services?

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,070
Give it to me.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,120
A master?

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
This is what you call a master?

26
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,360
Hurry up and take your pay!

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,400
Stop calling yourself a master!

28
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,770
Go now!

29
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,630
Master Nine, that old fox,

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,800
actually had the nerve

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,120
to use his precious granddaughter as bait.

32
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,240
Who could resist this beauty trap?

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,280
Someone else used the same beauty trap,

34
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,000
but ended up being humiliated
at a birthday banquet.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,120
You guys have taken over
the Western market,

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,520
yet can't even deal with Feishang Group?

37
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,360
(Is this related
to the small black stone?)

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,470
(So the small black stone)

39
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,780
(really helps me see the internal structure
of the raw stone!)

40
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,750
How's that raw stone?

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,190
Its appearance seems average.

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
Impressive! You're really something!

43
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,860
(Jade)
Here.

44
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,710
Shi Lai,

45
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,680
this badge

46
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,830
is the official appraiser certificate
from the Jade Society.

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,640
With it,

48
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,950
you can freely participate in any
public auctions at home or abroad.

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you, Master Nine!

50
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,390
No need to thank me.

51
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,600
You performed excellently today.

52
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,950
You really impressed me.

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,680
When you used the Cloud Vision Skill,

54
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,240
you looked exactly like your grandfather!

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
Master Nine,

56
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,390
I didn't rely on the Cloud Vision Skill;

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,240
I relied on the secret manual
Grandpa left me.

58
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,430
That's not important.

59
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,270
What's important is that from now on,

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,310
I'll do my best to help you

61
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,000
until you find your grandfather.

62
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,200
Thank you, Master Nine!

63
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,750
I'll take my leave now.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,840
Alright.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,840
(Grandpa,)

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
(wait for me.)

67
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,190
(With the Cloud Vision Skill,)

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
(I'll definitely find you.)

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,310
May I have the honor
of asking Miss Linda for a dance?

70
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,270
Sorry, the person
I've been waiting for has arrived.

71
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you for your help, Miss Linda.

72
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,630
Congratulations, Mr. Shi.

73
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,040
You've earned
the Jade Society certification

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,070
and Master Nine's approval.

75
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,560
It looks like the Lin and Gu families

76
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,630
will soon become even closer.

77
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,240
I don't drink.

78
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,720
Gu Yunmiao and I

79
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,630
are just friends,

80
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,000
and the Gu family and I
have a distant relationship.

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
So, are we…

82
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,160
friends?

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,600
If you say so, then we are.

84
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,310
Since you say we're friends,

85
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,390
how are you going to thank me?

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,920
Didn't you say it was free?

87
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,790
Yes,

88
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,190
I don't want your money.

89
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,560
I just…

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
I just want you...

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,930
to dance with me,

92
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,070
to bring us closer.

93
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,950
I…

94
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,830
I don't know how to dance.

95
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,480
Or perhaps…

96
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,310
you have another way to thank me?

97
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,760
For example…

98
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,160
Fine, I'll dance. Let's do it.

99
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,830
Linda, I really can't dance.

100
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,480
Just follow my moves.

101
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,390
How about you name your price, Miss Linda?

102
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,120
I'll figure out a way to pay you
for this brilliant strategy.

103
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
Mr. Shi, I don't want our relationship

104
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,390
to be just about money.

105
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,360
Please, don't put me in
a difficult position.

106
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,680
I apologize for my

107
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
bad attitude earlier, Miss Linda.

108
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
What did you call me?

109
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,200
Miss Linda?

110
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,470
Linda?

111
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,920
Linlin?

112
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,960
Please, just let me off.

113
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,790
I need your trust

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,150
for us to build a close partnership.

115
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,080
Gumie Public Auction is full of risks.

116
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,080
You need me,

117
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,750
and I need you.

118
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,590
Do you have information about the Auction?

119
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,630
Stick close to me

120
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
and don't get distracted.

121
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,230
Miaomiao,

122
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,080
why are you here?

123
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,290
Stop, there are too many people watching.

124
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,510
Yes, so many people are watching.

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,720
You dare to dance so closely
with her in public!

126
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,710
I…

127
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,840
Miss Linda helped me,

128
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,630
and I couldn't refuse her request.

129
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,120
What about me?

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
Miss Gu,

131
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm sorry

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,990
for not greeting you properly.

133
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,150
I'm here to find him.

134
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,540
Let's go.

135
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,510
I have something to discuss with Shi Lai.

136
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,750
Miss Gu, could you please wait?

137
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
Miss Linda,

138
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,320
you're putting me in a tough spot.

139
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,670
Mr. Shi,

140
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,150
one day, you'll have to clarify
your relationship with Miss Gu,

141
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,280
won't you?

142
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,200
Miaomiao,

143
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,630
why haven't you gone home yet?

144
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,320
Where are you?
I'll send someone to pick you up.

145
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
No need, Grandpa.

146
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,390
I'll be back soon.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm sorry!

148
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
Darn Shi Lai,

149
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,280
flirting around!

150
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,360
Changing affection like the wind!

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,330
Treating friendship lightly!

152
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,680
How could I like someone like you!

153
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,990
Lu Jingzhao?

154
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,630
What do you want?

155
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,110
Miaomiao,

156
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Shi Lai doesn't like you.

157
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,670
If he did, he wouldn't
be flirting with another woman,

158
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,120
ignoring your feelings.

159
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,550
That's none of your business.

160
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Get out of my way!

161
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,920
Miaomiao,

162
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,270
give me one more chance.

163
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,550
I'll defeat Shi Lai

164
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,320
and bring more benefits

165
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
to the Gu and Lu families.

166
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,030
I like him,

167
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,510
and it has nothing to do with

168
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,790
the benefits to the Gu family.

169
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Lu Jingzhao,

170
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,480
instead of targeting Shi Lai,

171
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,910
you should focus on yourself,

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,750
or I'll look down on you even more!

173
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,600
But what does your liking matter?

174
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,550
You can't make decisions
about your own marriage!

175
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,150
Before this,

176
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,600
your grandfather intended to match us.

177
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
Gu Yunmiao,

178
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,440
you only belong to me.

179
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,630
Dream on!

180
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,870
Grandpa already approves of Shi Lai.

181
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,030
No matter what he does,

182
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,480
I believe in him.

183
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,390
Lu Jingzhao,

184
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm really angry right now.

185
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
If you keep bothering me,
you won't get away with it.

186
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,270
Help!

187
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,600
There's a pervert
in the women's restroom!

188
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,110
Miaomiao!

189
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,380
Shi Lai!

190
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,990
Are you okay?

191
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,440
Are you okay or not?

192
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,620
Miss Linda,

193
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,670
I'll take Miaomiao back first.

194
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,110
We'll talk tomorrow.

195
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,480
So that's what he likes.

196
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,750
Looks like men

197
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,670
always want to be the flower protector.

198
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,320
It seems Shi Lai still cares
about the Lin family

199
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,670
and hasn't accepted
the olive branch from the Gu family.

200
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,080
His feelings for Gu Yunmiao

201
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,620
aren't romantic.

202
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,200
