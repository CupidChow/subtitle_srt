00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,040
Linda,

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,160
you're here.

5
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,710
I'm here.

6
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,150
Are you happy to see me?

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,640
Miaomiao, why did you come?

8
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,920
Are you

9
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,430
happy to see me?

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,480
You don't sound like her at all.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,870
Are you

12
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,840
happy to see me?

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,200
Are you making fun of me?

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
I still prefer the way you were before.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,950
What do you need me for?

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,710
Only she can come find you?

17
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,710
Can't I come find you?

18
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,870
Since you sent me home yesterday,

19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,920
I'll treat you to dinner today.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,760
Twelve o'clock, Zen Garden,

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
don't be late.

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,120
Okay. I'll come
right after I finish talking to Linda.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
Stupid Shi Lai.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
I thought he would like me that way.

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,150
Now I'm suffering.

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,740
Gu Yunmiao.

27
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,190
Linda.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Gu Yunmiao!

29
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,560
Gu Yunmiao.

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
Linda.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,000
As your older sister, let me remind you,

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,360
this outfit doesn't suit you.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Since you know you're the older sister,

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,240
stop thinking about

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
the younger grass.

36
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,680
Then I'll say

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,360
something to Miss Gu,

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,870
the rabbit doesn't eat
the grass by its den.

39
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,910
What does me eating the grass by the den

40
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,870
have to do with you?

41
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,870
So you admit you're a rabbit?

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,520
Hey!

43
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,270
Gu Yunmiao!

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,870
Which of you is Gu Yunmiao?

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,030
- Not me!
- Not me!

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Who is it then?

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
- It's her.
- It's her.

48
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,750
(The beauty filter is way too strong.)

49
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,310
(Whatever...)

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,870
Yes, sir?

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,870
I've got the person.

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,630
At the location you specified.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,630
No problem, I'll leave right away!

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,000
If you're satisfied, could you
leave a good review on the website?

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,310
- Stop moving.
- Good. Thank you!

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,800
By the way, sir,

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,710
I have a little surprise for you!

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,430
Would you stop?!

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,430
I'm not like you,

60
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,960
always relying on men.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,030
I rely on myself!

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,000
Miss Gu, you're really something.

63
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,360
You've tied the rope into a knot

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,800
with your own abilities.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,630
How dare you call it a "surprise"?

67
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,030
Get back here immediately!

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Sir!

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
I don't care what methods you use,

70
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,150
you must bring Linda back!

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,310
My target is only Gu Yunmiao.

72
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,510
Understand?!

73
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
Understood!

74
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,670
Sir,

75
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,040
which one is Gu Yunmiao?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,120
You can go.

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,750
Why are you letting her go alone?

78
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,070
Because she doesn't have the surname Gu.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,070
I can also not have the surname Gu.

80
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,230
You…

81
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,360
I don't want to leave.

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,120
Why should I go alone?

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,830
Does that mean
I'm less valuable than her?

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,630
Hi, sir.

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Linda doesn't want to leave.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
Yes, yes, okay.

87
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,110
You can go too.

88
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,030
I don't want to leave either.

89
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,110
Then I'll leave.

90
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,960
- Stop!
- Stop!

91
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,510
Do you think we're at your beck and call?

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,360
Did you forget what my Jade Bar

93
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
is for?

94
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,270
I'll dig up all your information!

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,040
Sister!

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,830
You're my only sister!

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,720
It's hard to make a living in this world,

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,190
please spare me!

99
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,240
Tell me who's behind this,

100
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,390
and I'll arrange a new job for you.

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,480
I really don't know who it is!

102
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,040
But... he

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,920
wears sunglasses,

104
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,830
drives a luxury car,

105
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
and is generous!

106
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,590
The most important thing is,

107
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,750
he pokes my forehead with his finger!

108
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,040
Sister, I've told you

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
everything I know!

110
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,470
Get lost.

111
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,190
Come back.

112
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,950
I didn't tell you to leave.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,870
I won't make it hard for you.

114
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,360
Call Shi Lai now,

115
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
tell him to come save us.

116
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Good idea.

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,630
I want to see

118
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,240
who he saves first.

119
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,070
I wonder if someone's thinking about me
or cursing me.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,950
Why hasn't Linda replied yet?

121
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,300
(Zhangjiawan, Jinyou Town, Yongjing City)

122
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,460
(Gu Yunmiao and Linda are in my hands.
If you want to save them, come alone!)

123
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,000
Let them go!

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If you have a problem, come for me!

125
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,910
Don't move!

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,720
I'll tell you,

127
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,360
you can only save

128
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,750
one of them.

129
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,260
Who do you choose?

130
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,240
Shi Lai, save me!

131
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
Lai,

132
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,380
save me.

133
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,720
- Save me first!
- Lai!

134
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,530
- Lai!
- Save me first!

135
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,510
Shi Lai, save me!

136
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,510
I'm scared!

137
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,710
Shi Lai!

138
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,150
- Save me! Me!
- Shi Lai!

139
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,150
- Save me!
- Shi Lai!

140
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,430
- Shi Lai!
- Shi Lai!

141
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,560
Shi Lai!

142
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,240
- Save me!
- Shi Lai!

143
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
- Save me!
- Shi Lai!

144
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,000
- Me, Shi Lai!
- Shi Lai!

145
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,640
- Save me!
- Me!

146
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,210
- Shi Lai!
- Save me first!

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,920
- Save me first!
- Shi Lai!

148
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,800
This is illegal detention!

149
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,000
Miss Gu has been found.

150
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,110
- Release them.
- Got it.

151
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,130
The Gu family
is really getting out of hand!

152
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,510
A mere supervisor

153
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,360
dares to threaten the entire Jade Society!

154
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,390
He said we kidnapped his granddaughter,

155
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,750
but where's the evidence?

156
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,510
Could it have been you guys?

157
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,760
Uncle Zhao,

158
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,570
if you look down on the Lu family,
you can just say it.

159
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,910
Do you really think I, Lu Jinghui,

160
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,320
would do such a foolish thing?

161
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,230
Jinghui,

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,080
now's not the time
to fight within Jade Society.

163
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,670
What do you think we should do next?

164
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
We should extinguish

165
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,670
the Gu family's arrogance!

166
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,270
Whether this matter is true or not,

167
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,630
it's a slap in the face
from the Gu family.

168
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,150
Since that's the case,

169
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
we can't show mercy anymore.

170
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,630
It's easier said than done.

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,000
The three families of ours
can suppress the Gu family,

172
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,960
but they're not fools!

173
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,600
How could we

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,320
crush them so easily?

175
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,850
What if I tell you

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,860
that I've planted

177
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,440
an important piece in the Feishang Group?

178
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,630
Did you do it?

179
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,510
Brother!

180
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,390
Brother!

181
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
Let me explain!

182
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,990
This…

183
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,150
It's all a misunderstanding!

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,550
I really didn't mean to harm Gu Yunmiao!

185
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,670
You fool,

186
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,670
you're more trouble

187
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,720
than you're worth!

188
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,920
Jingzhao,

189
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,750
since you've decided to strike,

190
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,150
there's no turning back.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
(Shi Lai,)

192
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,720
(I'm different from Gu Yunmiao.)

193
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,200
(I won't let go)

194
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,200
(of what's in my hands so easily.)

195
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
Luckily, it's just a muscle strain.

196
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,480
You can't act alone
next time, Young Master.

197
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,960
No worries,
I didn't even have to lift a finger,

198
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,390
the kidnapper ran off scared.

199
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
He must've been stunned
by my handsome figure.

200
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,080
But Young Master,

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,480
you still need to be careful
in the future.

202
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
Qiao Na,

203
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,030
don't stop,

204
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,030
this feels really good.

205
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,350
Qiao Na.

206
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,350
Qiao Na?

207
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,120
Lower a bit.

208
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
A bit lower.

209
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,750
Yes!

210
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,710
That's the spot!

211
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,470
Qiao Na,

212
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,240
it could also be my imagination…

213
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,200
Do you think

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,840
Linda likes me?

215
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,960
She's always teasing me.

216
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,200
You know,

217
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,080
love doesn't need

218
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,320
a reason.

219
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,670
Great people

220
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,750
just attract love from everyone.

221
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,840
You see, Gu Yunmiao
also has feelings for me, right?

222
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,200
Too much pressure!

223
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,790
Qiao Na, why do you have calluses
on your hands?

224
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,140
Alright, alright!

225
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,350
I apologize!

226
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,880
On one side is Linda,

227
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,840
and on the other is Gu Yunmiao.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
Which one should I choose?

229
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,240
You can't blame me!

230
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
With my charm,

231
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,080
how can I avoid

232
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,550
all the love?

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,360
Qiao Na, you can't have
any improper thoughts about me.

234
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,840
Otherwise, I won't be able to handle it.

235
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
You need to control yourself.

236
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,360
