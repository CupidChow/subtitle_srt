=Good Luck=

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,460
=Episode 28=

3
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,880
Wait!

4
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,900
(Xuantian Zibing Stone Cutting Ceremony)

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,680
Isn't that Shi Lai, who made a big splash
at the Gumie Public Auction?

6
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,430
I heard he went missing not long ago.

7
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Master Nine,

8
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,040
isn't it a bit underwhelming
to cut the Xuantian Zibing stone

9
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,640
without going through the Death Game?

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,310
You're still alive?!

11
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,430
Did she help restore your eyesight?

12
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,470
No.

13
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,240
I should thank you, Master Nine.

14
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,150
As traditional Chinese medicine
often says,

15
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,820
jade has the effect
of improving eyesight.

16
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,240
The Gu family's Lotus Jade

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,430
lives up to its name.

18
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,400
What the heck are you here for?

19
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Master Nine,

20
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,400
mind your manners.

21
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,520
If I remember correctly,

22
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
the Death Game...

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,720
between us wasn't finished yet.

24
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,430
Since you're still alive,

25
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,310
you should stay out of this.

26
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,470
Life is precious,

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,840
cherish it.

28
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,630
If you think your Heaven Vision Skill

29
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,630
can surpass my Cloud Vision Skill,

30
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,430
how about we compete?

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,840
What do you say?

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Fine. How do you propose we compete?

33
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,800
One cut each.

34
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,960
Whoever ruins the stone,

35
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,080
loses.

36
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
Fine.

37
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,590
Since you're asking for death,

38
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,910
don't blame me for being ruthless.

39
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,680
This raw stone is really not much.

40
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,520
It was picked from the market at random,

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,590
very cheap.

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,280
You want to use this to beat me?

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me remind you

44
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,430
of your grandfather's fate.

45
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,240
Ah well,

46
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,830
I should thank you.

47
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,240
As Lin Jiang's successor,

48
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,070
it's perfect to show everyone,

49
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,950
let them see,

50
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,550
that you and your grandfather, Lin Jiang,

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
are nothing

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
but pretentious fakes!

53
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
Is it funny?

54
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,870
I'll just win then.

55
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,120
You think you can win?

56
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,240
I will definitely win.

57
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,600
Because someone is expecting it.

58
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,950
Since I prepared raw stone,

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,150
you go ahead and cut first, Master Nine.

60
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,630
(The valuable part)

61
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,800
(of this stone is the jade band
at the top.)

62
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
(The two jade spots at the bottom)

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
(are completely worthless.)

64
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,600
You're being deliberately mystifying.

65
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,310
Master Nine,

66
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,070
the Cloud Vision Skill has a fatal flaw.

67
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,040
Do you want to know what it is?

68
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,220
Do you think I would believe you?

69
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,000
Trying to shake my confidence?

70
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,830
Though you're my enemy,

71
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
I have to admit
you were right about one thing.

72
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,210
You said that

73
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,370
stone gambling is essentially

74
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,450
a gamble on the human heart.

75
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,390
Since it's about human hearts,

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,600
I have to ask you—

77
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,960
are you

78
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,920
really confident?

79
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,510
Especially with so many cameras around,

80
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,040
can you really

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,430
be sure of your judgment?

82
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,630
(Could Lin Jiang really have kept
something back from the Cloud Vision Skill?)

83
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,600
(What exactly is he doing?)

84
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,600
(Could he be hiding something?)

85
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,120
Even if you have the Cloud Vision Skill,

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,950
you're still not as good as me.

87
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,070
What trick are you playing now?

88
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,720
Banging the table.

89
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
You...

90
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,800
still have the Cloud Vision Skill?

91
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,790
Do I?

92
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,160
Show up!

93
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,860
No.

94
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
No.

95
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,470
No.

96
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,670
No.

97
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,760
No.

98
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
No!

99
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,270
Show up.

100
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Just show up!

101
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
Just show up!

102
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,270
Show up!

103
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,470
Show up!

104
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
Show up!

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,840
No,

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
I have to find it,

107
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,400
or I'll have nothing left.

108
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,270
Or I'll have nothing left.

109
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,870
Or I'll have nothing left.

110
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,030
Show up!

111
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,510
Nothing left.

112
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,630
Nothing left.

113
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,190
Nothing left.

114
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,950
- Nothing left.
- Young Master.

115
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
Young Master, what's wrong?

116
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,040
Nothing left.

117
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,300
(Xuantian Zibing Stone Cutting Ceremony)

118
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,560
(This black spot,
I can completely avoid it.)

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,750
(Where is Shi Lai's trap?)

120
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,350
Master Nine,

121
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,990
you rely too much
on the Cloud Vision Skill.

122
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,600
You can't afford for it to fail.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,750
You're scheming.

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,680
The Cloud Vision Skill is perfectly fine.

125
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,270
Is it?

126
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,560
Perhaps I really am scheming.

127
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,480
(But if you plant)

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,310
(the seed of doubt in someone's heart,)

129
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,270
(it will naturally sprout.)

130
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,320
By the way,

131
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,910
don't you know if there are cracks

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,840
in that small black stone?

133
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,870
Also, one thing is for sure—

134
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,750
the Cloud Vision Skill

135
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,790
is that small black stone.

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,150
(No, he's trying to mislead me.)

137
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,950
(I can't let him affect my judgment.)

138
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Cut!

139
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,720
As expected, your Cloud Vision Skill
is only half-baked.

140
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,200
Didn't you know

141
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
that I can clearly see
the exact position of every black spot?

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,270
There's a black spot?

143
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,600
I believe you perfectly avoided it.

144
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,080
So, after this cut, the price

145
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,680
would definitely increase.

146
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,350
Stop saying nonsense.

147
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Trying to disrupt me with your words

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,630
and gain an advantage?

149
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,230
You really think...

150
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,570
you can succeed?

151
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,500
- Impressive!
- Just perfect!

152
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,000
This is amazing!

153
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,670
The price will definitely go up!

154
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,030
He's perfectly avoided that black spot!

155
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,080
The jade band is intact.

156
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,910
Though it lacks color,

157
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,750
it's wide enough!

158
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,390
A full three centimeters wide!

159
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,480
This raw stone's lower half
is nothing but skin.

160
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,270
Master Nine has perfectly increased
the value of the upper half.

161
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,910
However Shi Lai cuts it, there's no way
for it to rise in price again!

162
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
I've perfectly separated the part

163
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,000
that can be made into fine jade.

164
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you have left to turn the tide?

165
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,790
Shi Lai, it's your turn.

166
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,790
Cut, or admit defeat?

167
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,550
Stop pretending.

168
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,030
You thought a few words
could beat me?

169
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,250
You've lost.

170
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,390
Cut.

171
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,510
I overestimated you.

172
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,390
I'm telling you,

173
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,000
you're cutting off
the only two green spots

174
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,510
in the lower half.

175
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,790
As expected,

176
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,550
without the Cloud Vision Skill,

177
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
the Lin family

178
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,600
is nothing.

179
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,480
Master Nine,

180
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,910
it's not cut yet.

181
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,270
Shi Lai, this stone's value
has collapsed!

182
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,080
You lost!

183
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,960
You lost!

184
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,480
Stop pretending!

185
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,330
Admit it,

186
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,420
you lost!

187
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
Did I?

188
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,910
You haven't lost?

189
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,960
You've severed the only two jade spots!

190
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,510
You've destroyed this raw stone!

191
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
