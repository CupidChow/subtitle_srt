00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,460
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,640
Still moving.

4
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,560
- Relax.
- No!

5
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,640
Lin Yun!

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,750
Lin Yun!

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,390
Lin Yun!

8
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,320
No!

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,150
Lin Yun!

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,150
Stop!

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,400
I'll tell you!

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,480
Lin Yun!

13
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,790
Lin Yun!

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,790
Lin... Lin Yun!

15
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,190
Where are you?

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
Where are you?!

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
Lin... Lin Yun!

18
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,040
If I had known you'd give in so easily,

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,040
I should've captured him earlier!

20
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,790
Crazy!

21
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,150
You've gone mad!

22
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,280
Am I crazy?

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
Am I really crazy?

24
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,200
I have no other choice!

25
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,560
I must get the Cloud Vision Skill!

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,640
I must cut open the Xuantian Zibing stone!

27
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,280
I have no choice.

28
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,560
For Xuantian Zibing stone,

29
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,710
I can sacrifice everything!

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
And what have you two done
for the Cloud Vision Skill?

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,430
What have you and your grandson done?

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
Lin Jiang,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
what have you done?!

34
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,710
Now

35
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,000
it's me

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
giving you a chance!

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
Understand?!

38
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,270
Enough!

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
Lao...

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,400
Laojiu,

41
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,560
if I give you

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,200
the Cloud Vision Skill...

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,340
Grandpa!

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Laojiu,

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,430
if I give you the Cloud Vision Skill,

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
promise me,

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,910
let my grandson go.

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,430
Okay.

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,750
As long as you hand over
the Cloud Vision Skill,

50
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,800
you both can leave.

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,710
I won't need to.

52
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,950
I'm nearing the end of my life.

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,680
I won't live much longer.

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,800
For the sake of our old friendship,

55
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,750
let Lin...

56
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,150
let Shi Lai go!

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
Okay.

58
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,080
I can also

59
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,630
help him

60
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,190
get his sight back.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,120
Grandpa.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
Grandpa,

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
don't believe him.

64
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,800
That old fox

65
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,750
doesn't keep his promises.

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
Laojiu,

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
I ruined

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
your life too.

70
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,750
Now,

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,360
go save your...

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
life,

73
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,590
if it's still possible.

74
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,800
This is the Cloud Vision Skill?

75
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,800
This is the Cloud Vision Skill?

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
How...

77
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
How my five senses...

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
are all so clear?!

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,320
Lin Jiang,

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,430
this is the Cloud Vision Skill?

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
It is a...

82
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,390
meteorite from outer space.

83
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
It has a special magnetic field

84
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,120
that amplifies a person's five senses.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,840
That's why...

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,990
that's why I can appraise stones

87
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,630
without fail.

88
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,670
I see.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,190
I see now.

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Lin Jiang!

91
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,240
You've guarded this thing

92
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,830
for a lifetime!

93
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,360
It destroyed your family,

94
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,750
ruined your descendants!

95
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,710
And now

96
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,560
it's in my hands!

97
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,190
I'm not your lackey!

98
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm not useless!

99
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,910
I'm going to step on your shoulders,

100
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
in front of everyone,

101
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
cut open the Xuantian Zibing stone!

102
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,070
I am the number one stone appraiser
in the world!

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,150
Then I congratulate you.

104
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,800
I wish I could see with my own eyes...

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
whether

106
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,270
you're as handsome as I was

107
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,270
when I

108
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,520
was young...

109
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
Grandpa,

110
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,920
when we get out,

111
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,310
we'll treat our eyes,

112
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,200
and you'll be able to see me.

113
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,580
I'm definitely
more handsome than you ever were.

114
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,750
Grandpa...

115
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
Grandpa?

116
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,960
Grandpa!

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Grandpa...

118
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,960
Grandpa...

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Grandpa...

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,840
Grandpa...

121
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,260
Grandpa!

122
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,910
You...

123
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,920
you're dead?

124
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
Dead?!

125
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,000
Who allowed you to die?!

126
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
That is good!

127
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,870
At least you died for something!

128
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,270
No.

129
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,470
No!

130
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,070
How could you die?!

131
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
You can't die!

132
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,680
I haven't allowed you to die!

133
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,630
You haven't admitted it to me!

134
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,800
How could you die?!

135
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,360
Who allowed you to die?!

136
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,090
You were better than me only because
you had the Cloud Vision Skill!

137
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,680
You can't die!

138
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
You can't die!

139
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,750
You haven't admitted it to me!

140
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,000
Admit it!

141
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,310
Admit

142
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,510
that I'm better than you!

143
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,750
I will cut open the Xuantian Zibing stone!

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,750
I will step on your shoulders!

145
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,240
I am the king of the jade world!

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,320
I am the number one stone appraiser
in the world!

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,670
How could you...

148
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,670
How could you...

149
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,910
How could you never admit it...

150
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,240
You never admitted it to me,
even in death!

151
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,030
No, Grandpa!

152
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,990
Grandpa,

153
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,780
you've already got
the Cloud Vision Skill,

154
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,140
and Shi Lai is already blind.

155
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,030
Please, let them go.

156
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,510
Please, Grandpa, don't kill Shi Lai!

157
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,410
Miaomiao.

158
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,800
Calm down,

159
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
be more ruthless.

160
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,080
Be careful. Don't hurt her.

161
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,410
Shi Lai,

162
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,350
hold me hostage.

163
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,290
Hold me hostage!

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,030
Step back!

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,360
If you dare touch him,

166
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,870
I'll die right here!

167
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,240
I'm begging you.

168
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,200
Grandpa, please!

169
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,750
Please don't hurt him!

170
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,720
Look at him!

171
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,870
He's useless now!

172
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,240
You're risking your life
for a useless person!

173
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,920
Miaomiao,

174
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,700
you're too naive.

175
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't force me, Grandpa.

176
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,120
Remember,

177
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,120
the world is cruel.

178
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
Naive people

179
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,680
don't even get the chance
to fight for their lives.

180
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,840
Grandpa, I'm begging you!

181
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Grandpa!

182
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,000
Shi Lai.

183
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,600
I want you to die understanding.

184
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,980
Aren't you curious?

185
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,100
On the Death Game,

186
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,110
everyone inhaled the drug powder,

187
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,360
but only your eyes went blind

188
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,030
while others were fine.

189
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,120
The powder itself isn't poisonous,

190
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
however,

191
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,240
when combined with a certain tonic,

192
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,080
it becomes

193
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,960
a poison that causes blindness!

194
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,350
Yes,

195
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
it was the tonic

196
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,150
you've been making for Shi Lai
to drink these past few days.

197
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,410
I had no idea.

198
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,510
That's not it, Shi Lai.

199
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
No, Shi Lai!

200
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,240
The formula was given to me
by you, Grandpa!

201
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,080
I didn't know!

202
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,120
Shi Lai, I didn't know!

203
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,960
So,

204
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
it's you...

205
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,470
You personally poisoned Shi Lai
and made him blind.

206
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,240
Give up.

207
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,360
You personally ruined Shi Lai.

208
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,120
Give up your unrealistic fantasies!

209
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't forget your identity.

210
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,550
Go to hell!

211
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,120
Shi Lai.

212
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,260
Miaomiao!

213
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,210
Miaomiao,

214
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
where are you hurt?

215
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,550
I...

216
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,720
I'll stop your bleeding!

217
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm sorry, Shi Lai.

218
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,990
Miaomiao...

219
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,920
That's not it.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,840
Miaomiao.

221
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,840
- That's not it!
- It's fine.

222
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,390
- No!
- It's fine. It's fine.

223
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Don't hate me.

224
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,880
But don't forget me.

225
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,510
Actually, forget me.

226
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,600
But slowly.

227
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,790
That was disinfection.

228
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,850
Miaomiao.

229
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,320
Miaomiao.

230
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,590
Miaomiao!

231
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,510
Miaomiao.

232
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,750
Miaomiao!

233
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,560
Miaomiao!

234
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,840
That's not it, Miaomiao.

235
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,680
That's not it.

236
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,510
Miaomiao.

237
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,510
Miaomiao, wake up.

238
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,350
Miaomiao...

239
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,750
Take her back.

240
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,870
- Let go!
- No!

241
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,920
Let go!

242
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Miaomiao!

243
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,750
Miaomiao!

244
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,010
No! No! No!

245
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,920
Get off me!

246
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,990
Get off me!

247
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,770
Miaomiao!

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,840
Miaomiao!

249
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,270
Miaomiao!

250
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,740
Miaomiao!

251
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,460
Miaomiao!

252
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,090
Miaomiao!

253
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,380
That's not it!

254
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,630
No, I...

00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,560
