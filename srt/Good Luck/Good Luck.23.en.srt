187
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,690
I'll wipe the floor with your face!

188
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,600
And I'll make sure this stupid woman

189
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,890
ends up in my bed!

190
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,060
You can curse me,
but you can't curse Miaomiao.

191
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,900
I…!

192
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
Exactly!

193
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,520
You can't curse me!

194
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
You two!

195
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,120
You were a bit too harsh, weren't you?

196
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,600
He brought it

197
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
on himself!

198
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
Impressive.

199
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,160
His schemes,

200
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,360
his bravery,

201
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,180
and his every move—everything was planned!

202
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,720
Twenty yuan!

203
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,590
Twenty yuan!

204
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,130
I can only

205
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,580
admire him!

206
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,320
Lin Jiang,

207
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,870
I have some good news for you.

208
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,870
Your grandson went to
the Gumie Public Auction today,

209
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
and despite all odds,

210
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,920
he won the top spot.

211
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,130
He really has your old style.

212
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,620
You won't touch him.

213
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
You won't touch him!

214
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,000
That depends on

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,550
whether you're willing to divulge
the secrets of Cloud Vision.

216
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,850
Even after I die,

217
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,610
I won't let you have
Cloud Vision's secrets!

218
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,120
And my grandson

219
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,040
won't be at your mercy!

220
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,410
You've said it.

221
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,180
Don't regret it later!

222
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,870
Yun!

223
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,250
Yun, please stay safe!

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,480
Shi Lai, you were so cool!

225
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,780
All this training was worth it, huh?

226
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,840
Of course. It's all worth it!

227
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,600
Look at these—they're full of value!

228
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,790
Look at them!

229
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,420
- Should I add more value to you?
- No need!

230
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,630
Are you alright?

231
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,500
You've been tricked!

232
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,910
Linda.

233
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,510
You won't disappoint me, right?

234
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,470
I won't.

235
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,000
Find a way to get Shi Lai
to take this drug.

236
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,110
What is it?

237
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,120
Since when did you become so nosy?

238
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,080
Just remember,

239
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,390
don't disappoint me.
