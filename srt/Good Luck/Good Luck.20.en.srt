=Episode 20=

3
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,430
Rest well,

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,520
we have class tomorrow.

5
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,510
Miaomiao, I... I...

6
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,460
I was...

7
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,080
You need disinfection.

8
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,000
Listen closely!

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,230
I met you first,

10
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,120
I asked you to be
my stone appraiser first,

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,560
and I trained you first!

12
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,070
Also,

13
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,700
I entrusted the Lotus Jade to you.

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,120
First come, first served, got it?

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,310
Got it, got it!

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,620
That was disinfection.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,200
You still have class tomorrow,

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,040
go to bed early.

19
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,430
What is it?

20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,870
Lately, Shi Lai somehow

21
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,480
has suddenly started resisting practicing
the Cloud Vision Skill,

22
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,910
and instead, he's been studying
stone appraisal.

23
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,240
Sounds like there's an issue
with the Skill.

24
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm not sure.

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,030
I need more time.

26
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,030
For this Gumie Public Auction,
I'll send Guishou there.

27
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,840
He'll compete

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,250
with Shi Lai and test his abilities.

29
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,590
Why rush?

30
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,430
I can...

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,750
Lin Jiang's health is deteriorating.

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
I don't have much time.

33
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,400
This green color in this circumstance
is a distraction.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,630
She's right,

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
it's an illusion.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Remember it.

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,260
The two outer skin types
I mentioned earlier.

38
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,810
- Look here.
- Make sure you remember them clearly.

39
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,120
The color and transparency...

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,860
Look here.

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,560
Icy jade and glassy jade
have different textures.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
Shi Lai, what's up with your notes?

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
Shi Lai!

44
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,060
(Jadeite Basics)

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,780
(Gumie Public Auction,
World's Top Auction)

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,520
(After the hellish training,)

47
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,280
(I)

48
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,500
(High-tier Raw Stone)
(have mastered stone appraisal skills.)

49
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,240
(Finally, I've entered
the legendary World's Top Auction.)

50
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,300
(Judging Panel)

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,710
(I hope the small black stone
and the Stone Appraisal Manual)

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,560
(can help me win and find Grandpa!)

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,490
This place is too simple, isn't it?

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,910
The jade is hidden in raw stones,

55
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,840
and the auction is hidden in the market.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,380
This is the core idea
of the Gumie Public Auction.

57
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,070
Since it's hidden in the market,

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,240
people from all fields come to watch.

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,520
So, it's all about equality?

60
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,460
(Past Champion)

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,450
Grandpa,

62
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,040
I will find you.

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,760
Grandpa?

64
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,680
Miaomiao.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,510
Why are you here, Grandpa?

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm one of the judges.

67
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,270
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,510
You packed all my books

69
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,420
overnight and air shipped them,

70
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,830
and didn't tell me?

71
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,120
What a granddaughter I have.

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,630
Packed up everything without leaving

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,680
a single one behind.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,400
Shi Lai,

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm part of the judging panel,

76
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,600
but you know I follow strict principles.

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Understood.

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,180
Grandpa!

79
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
I won't break the rules for you.

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,360
But if someone

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
tries to use the rules to sabotage you,

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,600
I won't stand by idly.

83
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,680
Thank you, Master Nine.

84
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,720
No need to thank me.

85
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,270
The jade world is deep.

86
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,030
Move!

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,580
Dong's here!

88
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,590
Good dogs don't block the way!

89
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,040
Talking to you, move!

90
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,270
"Good dogs"?

91
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,160
- Are you looking to die?!
- Stop!

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,270
I'm sorry, Master Nine.

93
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,960
It's my fault.

94
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,910
Family rules.

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,760
Boss, I...

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,600
Master Nine is a senior figure
in the jade world!

97
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,040
How dare you disrespect him?!

98
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Family rules!

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
Anyone who gets in my way,

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,480
I'll deal with them.

101
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,270
Did you see?

102
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,110
He's the stone appraiser
the Lu and Zhao families

103
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,040
hired to go after you.

104
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,040
Be careful.

105
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,270
I will.

106
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
Be cautious,

107
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,680
don't force it.

108
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,400
Don't worry,

109
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,800
I slept eight hours last night.

110
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
Linda's right,

111
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,960
this Gumie Public Auction

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,270
really has some hidden talents.

113
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,390
The Gumie Public Auction

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,480
gathers the top stone appraisal elites
from across the country,

115
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,160
truly a World's Top Auction.

116
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,680
This time

117
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,480
we have Mr. Yuanzhi

118
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,480
as a guest commentator.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,500
The auction is packed with top talents,

120
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,040
including Zhao Dong

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,950
from the Northeast,

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,360
the recently rising Shi Lai,

123
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,240
who inherited Lin Jiang's

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,630
Cloud Vision Skill,

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,600
and even the mysterious and low-key Guilao

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,480
has sent his disciple, Guishou.

127
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,740
(Gumie Public Auction,
World's Top Auction)

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Hello?

129
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,670
Shi Lai,

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,120
I'm helping with

131
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
remote price references for the Auction,

132
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
so I can't be there.

133
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,400
Do your best.

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,160
I'll do my best.

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Shi Lai,

136
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,000
don't force it,

137
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,110
be cautious.

138
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,650
Don't worry.

139
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
And

140
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,480
watch out for Guishou.

141
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,120
Understood.

142
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,600
I hereby announce the Gumie Public Auction

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
has officially started!

144
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,550
- Step aside!
- This one's mine!

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,700
(Mid-tier Raw Stone)
Don't take my stone!

146
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,640
I picked this one first!

147
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,630
How much is this?

148
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,150
Give it to me.

149
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,320
What are you doing?

150
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,300
How much?

151
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,390
500,000.

152
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,320
Within appraisal range.

153
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,790
That's the upper limit, right?

154
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,230
I'll take it.

155
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,600
I want this one.

156
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,670
In less than a minute,

157
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,910
Dong is ready to cut the stone,

158
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,000
having spent all his initial funds!

159
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,550
That's some serious confidence!

160
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,670
Isn't he going to reconsider?

161
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,790
The scene is full of
stone appraisal masters.

162
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,670
The later you act,
the fewer top-tier raw stones remain.

163
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,320
Who do you think has the best chance?

164
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,270
On the surface,

165
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,630
Dong seems to be ahead.

166
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,670
But from my professional point of view,

167
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,030
I'm more optimistic about

168
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,000
those two.

169
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,440
In such a stressful,

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,270
fast-paced environment,

171
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,150
their focus

172
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,670
and calmness

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,270
are unshaken.

174
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,390
It reminds me of

175
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,910
my own glory days.

176
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,990
(What's going on?)

177
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,390
(Could the Cloud Vision Skill
be still preparing?)

178
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,610
(How come?)

179
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,630
(I've never heard of Lin Jiang
needing to prepare like this)

180
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,680
(when appraising stones.)

181
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,440
(I can't take it any more.)

182
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,850
(This is awkward.)

183
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,150
(Forget it.)

184
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,470
(Master said to keep an eye on him,)

185
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,910
(so I'll just stand here for now.)

186
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,450
(Judging Panel)
What's wrong with him?

187
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,030
Didn't sleep well?

188
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
Grandpa?

189
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,440
Maybe he has his own reasons.

190
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,750
Shi Lai,

191
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,030
what are you planning?

192
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,030
Do we really need to leave so early?

193
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,030
I wanted to sleep more.

194
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,200
Go early to adjust to the environment.

195
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,810

for eight hours.

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,030
Miss Miaomiao,

197
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,670
for this past month,
I've only been sleeping two hours a night.

198
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,710
Stop complaining.

199
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
Almost forgot.

200
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,750
Books.

201
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,300
Snacks. Water.

202
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,510
One more. Perfect. Go.

203
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,790
