3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,710
The most recent winner

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,710
was your grandfather,

5
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,350
Cloud Vision Lin Jiang.

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,660
But…

7
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,930
They all disappeared.

8
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,290
Yes.

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,060
There's word from Guilao that

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,300
anyone who won the Death Game

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,660
was never seen again.

12
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,650
If the Death Game

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,620
is so dangerous,

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,260
why do they still take part?

15
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,260
You've just entered the world of jade,

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,780
so you can't quite understand.

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,580
We're talking about Xuantian Zibing here!

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,660
I get it now!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,100
So,

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,340
whoever can cut open Xuantian Zibing,

21
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,600
will become the world's
number one stone appraiser?

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,660
But, if I remember correctly,

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,340
Grandpa wasn't someone

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,900
who cared about fame.

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,420
Never mind!

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,450
First, I'll just win
the Gumie Public Auction.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,040
What?

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,500
You don't think I'm capable?

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,220
After all, I'm the one who possesses

30
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,660
the Cloud Vision Skill, right?

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,950
Do you even know
how the Gumie Public Auction works?

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,060
What else is there?

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,100
Isn't it just about
appraising and cutting stones?

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,300
Could there be a genius

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,360
who can design
a more complicated way to compete?

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,370
The Auction gathers national champions
of stone appraisal competitions.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,660
Each contestant has a base fund
of 500,000 yuan

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,140
to select raw stones on-site.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,500
Within the time
of burning one incense stick,

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,050
each person can pick three stones.

41
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,300
- Though the starting limit is 500,000,
- Cut mine!

42
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,860
after purchasing a raw stone,
you can cut it on-site

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,820
and use the money from selling it
to buy more.

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,420
(Gumie Public Auction, World's Top Auction)
Cut mine first!

45
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,220
The judges will estimate
each stone's value

46
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,020
based on real-time prices
shown on the large screen,

47
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,740
and on-site buyers will make purchases.

48
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,500
(Gumie Public Auction Rankings)

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
Rankings are updated in real-time

50
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,020
based on the selling price.

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,700
The higher the price,
the higher the rank.

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,220
Isn't this just the same old routine?

53
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,300
Choose stones, appraise them,
then cut them.

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,740
Aren't you taking notes?

55
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,500
Are the stones the contestants cut
theirs to keep?

56
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,980
Yes.

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,020
And the money from selling them

58
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,620
is theirs too?

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,700
Exactly.

60
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,140
Hey, focus!

61
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,140
Focus!

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,300
Let's get back to the lesson.

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,820
We only have a month,

64
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,540
and these materials are overwhelming!

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,180
This is just the catalog.

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
The real materials

67
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,260
are over there.

68
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,980
I take back what I said earlier.

69
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,140
I think the person
who designed this competition

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,420
is really foolish.

71
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,820
Shi Lai,

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,460
from now on,

73
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
please call me

74
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
Miss Miaomiao.

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,180
Miss Miaomiao,

76
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,020
we're out of coffee beans,

77
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,820
can we buy more?

78
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,200
Were you even paying attention?

79
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,300
Shi Lai!

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,300
Get up

81
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,340
and study.

82
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,020
I'm in the bathroom!

83
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,140
Finish reading this first!

84
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,780
(Top Ten Keys: Character, Mentality...)

85
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,580
Shi Lai!

86
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,140
Miss Miaomiao.

87
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,620
Look. The book says

88
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,140
the jade from Xiaomakan Quarry
is particularly valuable,

89
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,060
(Price Trend of Xiaomakan Quarry's Jade)
but the data here shows

90
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,860
the price has been dropping
in recent years.

91
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,980
Why?

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,880
Well...

93
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,000
hold on, let me ask my grandpa.

94
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
It's because Xiaomakan Quarry's

95
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,310
initial reserves were low,

96
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,430
which caused high prices.

97
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,820
As mining increased,

98
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,180
the price naturally dropped.

99
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,060
When did you get here?

100
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,300
Just now.

101
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,500
Linda's not an outsider.

102
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,380
How is she not an outsider?

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,700
I am not.

104
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,500
Right, Shi Lai?

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,460
Uh, yes...

106
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,820
or maybe not…?

107
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,410
What are you here for?

108
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,620
I'm here to help him.

109
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,180
I can handle it myself.

110
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,200
Are you sure?

111
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,060
If there's a problem,
wouldn't it be better

112
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,770
if Master Nine came personally?

113
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,250
That would be great!

114
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,130
Never mind, it's not really appropriate.

115
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,060
Where are you going?

116
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
To get coffee!

117
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,940
See you,

118
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,540
- Miss Miaomiao.
- I'm not his teacher.

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,420
You are his teacher!

120
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,090
Miss Gu

121
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,000
is kind,

122
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,700
but she really doesn't understand

123
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
the current jade trading situation.

124
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,180
Looks like she

125
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,180
has moved all of
the Gu family's books here.

126
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,100
Is there a problem?

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,870
This book

128
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,940
is even older than I am.

129
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,790
I brought some new study materials.

130
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,180
Are there many?

131
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,380
It's fine,

132
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,550
they're all in my handbag.

133
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,940
As long as the bag
can hold them, it's fine!

134
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,140
(April 8, 2024)

135
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,820
These materials are temporary.

136
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,740
There's more?

137
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Of course!

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,940
The jade market fluctuates in real time.

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,550
If you don't understand
the first-hand trading conditions,

140
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,820
how can you anticipate fluctuations

141
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,060
and estimate prices?

142
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,700
Besides,

143
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,260
jade trading theories

144
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,700
are constantly evolving.

145
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,700
While they don't change fast,

146
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,740
one day these theories

147
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,060
could have a big impact
on the jade market.

148
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,500
You should learn this, shouldn't you?

149
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
What?

150
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,340
Running out of words?

151
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,940
Come with me to move the study materials.

152
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,300
More?

153
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,820
Right over there.

154
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,060
Linda,

155
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm just a mortal!

156
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,060
Don't you have Cloud Vision Skill?

157
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,620
I can't read everything in one go!

158
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,060
There are only 24 hours in a day.

159
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,800
If I tried to go through all of it,
I'd go blind!

160
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,260
This is too much!

161
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,800
Even online dramas
wouldn't dare portray this.

162
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,180
Okay, enough jokes.

163
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,500
The boxes aren't filled with documents,

164
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,140
but with raw stone samples.

165
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,210
Raw stones?

166
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,870
What are they for?

167
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,480
Are you really proficient
with Cloud Vision Skill?

168
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,770
That's exactly the issue.

169
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,260
Using Cloud Vision Skill
consumes a lot of energy,

170
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,820
I still can't use it

171
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,370
at will.

172
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,500
Everyone at the Gumie Public Auction

173
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,180
is a top-tier stone appraiser.

174
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,590
Shi Lai,

175
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,340
even though you have
the Cloud Vision Skill,

176
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,800
remember that jade culture
has been passed down for millennia.

177
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,810
Don't underestimate the world's heroes.

178
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,060
Got it.

179
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,200
Then go ahead and move them.

180
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,780
Oh, God.

181
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,220
(Shi Lai,)

182
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,740
(I don't know)

183
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,260
(if I'm helping you or hurting you.)

184
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,860
Generating qi isn't hard,

185
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,380
it just requires focus.

186
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,060
Gathering it is tough,

187
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,620
but dispersing it is quick.

188
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,860
(What's that sound?)

189
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,220
What?

190
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,060
So many cracks?

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,740
Feels like this stone's going to break.

192
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,240
This is my final card.

193
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,920
(Looks like I can't rely on
the Cloud Vision Skill too much.)

194
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,780
(I need to figure out a way)

195
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,460
(to improve my stone appraisal skills.)

196
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,420
(Quarry: Place where jade is mined)

197
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,260
Miss Linda,

198
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,300
I was just a little tired.

199
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,940
I'll start studying right away!

200
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,900
I have something to ask you.

201
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,700
Answer me truthfully.

202
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,940
What is it?

203
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,140
Why...

204
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,540
did you suddenly start studying
stone appraisal knowledge?

205
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,940
I've noticed you haven't been practicing

206
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,460
the Cloud Vision Skill lately.

207
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,460
Didn't you tell me

208
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,780
the Gumie Public Auction

209
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,800
is full of hidden talents?

210
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,020
Tell me the truth.

211
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,620
I did.

212
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,340
Is there something wrong

213
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,480
with your Cloud Vision Skill?

214
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,340
Don't worry,

215
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
it's fine.

216
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,300
Linda,

217
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,180
what's going on?

218
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,660
Promise me,

219
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,410
no matter what happens,

220
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,060
always trust me.

221
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,660
I've always trusted you.

222
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,780
Not that kind of trust.

223
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,940
Then what kind of trust?

224
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,460
When all this is over,

225
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,700
I have so much to tell you.

226
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,060
So much…

227
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
I want to say.

228
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,230
Rest well,

229
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,260
we have class tomorrow.

230
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,560
Miaomiao, I... I...

231
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,630
I was...

232
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,580
You need disinfection.

233
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,100
Listen closely!

234
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,700
I met you first,

235
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,580
I asked you to be
my stone appraiser first,

236
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,060
and I trained you first!

237
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,380
Also,

238
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,180
I entrusted the Lotus Jade to you.

239
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,580
First come, first served, got it?

240
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,540
