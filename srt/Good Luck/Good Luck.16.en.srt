3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,390
You're thinking too much.

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,790
What I'm after…

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,640
is something much more important.

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
Enough!

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,800
Everything is off the table!

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,400
Miaomiao!

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,560
Talk to you later.

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,190
See you.

11
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,380
(Zui Fan Hua Music Bar)
Miaomiao.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
Miaomiao, stop sulking. Miaomiao.

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,560
Miaomiao. Miaomiao!

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,510
Have you fallen for her?

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
No! Absolutely not!

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,870
When you look at her,

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,310
your eyes almost pop out!

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,870
It's not like that!

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,480
But her demands are too unreasonable!

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,790
Miaomiao,

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,310
right now, the only person
who can help us is her.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,400
Do you have another option?

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,510
Wait a minute,

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,870
everything I'm doing here is to help you

25
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,400
and Feishang Group,

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,560
so why am I

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
being made out to be the villain?

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,560
Fine,

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,400
go and accompany her.

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,200
But let's set three rules.

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,480
First,

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,510
no physical contact.

33
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,470
Second,

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,790
don't fall for her.

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
Third,

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
spend no more than an hour with her.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,600
This isn't fair!

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
Why am I the one getting screwed over?

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
Linda.

40
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,190
Lai, you're here.

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,030
Where's your little princess?

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Forget what happened yesterday.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,030
Miaomiao has a quick temper.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm apologizing on her behalf.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,840
It's no big deal.

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
No need to worry.

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,960
So...

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,470
do you need anything from me?

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,710
Come here.

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,240
Don't be scared,

51
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,030
I won't bite.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,310
Relax.

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,150
This is painful!

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,030
Breathe out.

55
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,150
Good.

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Down.

57
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,560
- A little lower.
- It's broken!

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
It's really broken!

59
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,480
- A little lower.
- I can't do this!

60
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,760
Linda, please let me off!

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,170
Good. Up.

62
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,870
No, no, no!

63
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,470
My body's too stiff, Linda!

64
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,870
I can't do this!

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,870
That's why

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,870
you'll need to practice flexibility.

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,710
Now, assist me.

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,870
Linda,

69
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,750
are we done?

70
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,410
- I really can't do this anymore.
- Fine.

71
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,710
I won't push you further.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,240
But

73
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,150
you have to promise me one more thing,

74
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,430
and I'll help you.

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,310
There's one more?

76
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,470
Why is she not here yet?

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,560
Is she playing me?

78
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,870
Mr. Liu,

79
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,310
I'm sorry I'm late.

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,430
No worries.

81
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,900
A beauty like you,

82
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,380
I don't mind waiting!

83
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,150
I heard you don't like red wine,

84
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,590
so I brought you a bottle of whiskey.

85
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,430
Great!

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
Sit down.

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,270
When the boss lady pours my drink,

88
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,160
I like whatever it is.

89
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,120
Mr. Liu,

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,390
I started dabbling

91
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,120
in the raw stone business last year

92
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,250
and bought a few small items.

93
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,740
Unfortunately…

94
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,870
I'm not very skilled

95
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,310
and lost some money.

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
So,

97
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,200
I came to you for advice.

98
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,470
Don't worry!

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
With me around,

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,190
you won't

101
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,470
lose money.

102
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,190
What do you mean?

103
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,190
Don't you remember?

104
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,670
I am

105
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,870
the top raw stone faker

106
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,690
in Yongjing!

107
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,390
In business,

108
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,720
whether it's real or fake

109
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,120
doesn't matter,

110
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,600
as long as you make money.

111
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,150
For instance,

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,510
this piece you're wearing...

113
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,510
it's fake.

114
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,190
Is it?

115
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,630
As long as

116
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,750
you, Miss Linda,

117
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,160
get closer to me...

118
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,510
Beast!

119
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,950
If

120
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,390
you don't show sincerity,

121
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,430
we can forget about

122
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,390
the business.

123
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,750
Mr. Liu,

124
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,630
don't rush.

125
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,040
Beautiful roses

126
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,390
always have thorns.

127
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,950
If you

128
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,510
want to pick flowers,

129
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,830
you have to accept

130
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,750
the risk of being pricked.

131
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,750
A beautiful, ruthless woman

132
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,840
is the most exciting.

133
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,750
Inviting you here,

134
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,870
isn't that enough sincerity?

135
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,270
Yes!

136
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,630
That's enough!

137
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,830
Then where is your sincerity?

138
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,270
What do you want?

139
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,360
Mr. Liu,

140
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,510
you claim to be an expert
in raw stone faking.

141
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,600
You should at least

142
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,750
show me what you got.

143
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,460
That's easy!

144
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,750
Easy!

145
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,750
The easiest flaw

146
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,270
in raw stone faking is in dyeing.

147
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,430
After soaking the fake outer skin

148
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,630
in dye,

149
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,780
the seams

150
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,160
will accumulate color.

151
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,620
Experts

152
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,750
can spot it immediately.

153
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,910
But

154
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,950
my method is different.

155
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,950
We spray the fake skins

156
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,630
layer by layer

157
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,390
using a sprayer,

158
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
and the workers

159
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,190
use small brushes to clean the seams.

160
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,590
Finally,

161
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,230
we use chemicals

162
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,060
to age it,

163
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
making sure

164
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,540
it looks like
it just came from the earth.

165
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,630
Mr. Liu, you really are sincere.

166
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,950
How about you go wash up first?

167
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,910
Wash up?

168
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,240
Sure! Sure!

169
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
Linda,

170
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,670
are you okay?

171
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,960
Brother!

172
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,110
Something's happened

173
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,310
to the Liu family!

174
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,670
What's the panic?

175
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,830
These are the shops and people

176
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,630
controlled by the Liu family's quarries.

177
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,950
Go take care of it.

178
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,940
(Staff List)

179
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,470
So…

180
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
Brother,

181
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,750
did you already know
the Liu family was going to fall,

182
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,510
or

183
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,320
did you arrange all this?

184
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,750
I predicted that Shi Lai
would uncover Zhang Qi as a pawn

185
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,630
and that he would take down
the Liu family.

186
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,840
My initial plan was to use him
to do the work for me.

187
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,040
That way,

188
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,200
the Liu family's business

189
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,720
would be ours.

190
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,390
I see.

191
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,230
Brother,

192
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,510
you really are brilliant!

193
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,630
- Shi Lai.
- Miaomiao. How's it going?

194
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,910
The Liu family's illegal workshop
has been shut down.

195
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,510
Liu Xinchen's in jail.

196
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,300
President Liu's embroiled in a scandal

197
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,060
and is now hiding at home like a turtle.

198
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,460
Great!

199
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,300
This solves Feishang Group's crisis.

200
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,940
But…

201
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,980
Lu Jinghui is too cunning,

202
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,740
he's managed to
clear himself of any blame.

203
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,780
As expected.

204
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,140
Lu Jinghui is too cautious,

205
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,780
it's hard to catch him.

206
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,740
It's a pity

207
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,860
we didn't find any new leads
about Grandpa.

208
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,990
Looks like his disappearance

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,540
isn't related to the Liu family.

210
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,020
Don't worry,

211
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,900
we'll find him!

212
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,890
By the way,

213
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,980
Linda really helped this time.

214
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,260
I'll thank her properly later.

215
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,820
She's left.

216
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,740
Left?

217
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,940
Where did she go?

218
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,620
Wait,

219
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,860
how do you know so much about her?

220
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,290
She helped me a lot,

221
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,740
I thought I should at least send her off.

222
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,580
Shi Lai,

223
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,500
don't forget the promise you made.

224
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,650
Can you tell me

225
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,650
what it will be?

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,140
The unknown

227
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,620
always piques curiosity.

228
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,220
I'm leaving,

229
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,860
but

230
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,140
this isn't our last meeting.

231
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,460
Safe travels.

232
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,460
Shi Lai,

233
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,500
do you think

234
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Linda's

235
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,020
cold, elegant,

236
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
and alluring?

237
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,820
It's not like that!

238
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,090
She's just

239
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,740
brave and captivating,

240
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,260
but I think she's too mysterious.

241
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,260
She must have a huge secret.

242
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,900
I just feel she's too dangerous.

243
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,660
Stay away from her,

244
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,020
or you might end up in trouble.

245
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,220
Alright, alright.

246
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,740
We should get ready for Gumie.

247
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,020
No wonder you're Lin's grandson.

248
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,090
You're smart and brave.

249
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,550
You flatter me, Master Nine.

250
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,570
Miaomiao's mother

251
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,220
was an excellent stone appraiser too,

252
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
but

253
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,100
passed away young.

254
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,140
Her relic, the Lotus Jade,

255
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,220
was lost in Gumie City.

256
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,140
That's why

257
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,460
Miaomiao has always wanted to go there.

258
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,260
Miaomiao and I are the same,

259
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,660
doing it for our families.

260
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,540
When you two are in Gumie,

261
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,340
I hope

262
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,880
you'll take goof care of her.

263
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,720
No worries, Master Nine.

264
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,140
I'll look after her.

265
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,620
They're heading to Gumie City.

266
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,740
Our plan

267
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,620
can start now.

268
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,900
After all this setup,

269
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,780
don't disappoint me.

270
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,140
I don't want to wait anymore.

271
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,980
Understand?

272
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,340
I'm exhausted.

273
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,220
Spent the whole day
with nothing to show for it.

274
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,340
Don't be discouraged.

275
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,500
We'll continue tomorrow.

276
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,540
Trust me,

277
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,780
we'll find the Lotus Jade.

278
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,650
- One room, please.
- Sure.

279
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,860
Two rooms!

280
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,380
- One!
- Two!

281
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,300
One!

282
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,620
Men and women must keep their distance.
Two rooms.

283
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,700
I'm a fragile woman,

284
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,600
unfamiliar with this place.

285
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,490
- One room.
- Two!

286
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,140
- One!
- Two!

287
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
One!

288
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
You two don't need to argue.

289
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,860
There's only one room available.

290
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,100
Enjoy your stay.

291
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,540
You sleep in the bed,

292
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,020
I'll sleep on the floor.

293
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,580
Why?

294
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,100
It's just the two of us.

295
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,020
What a rare opportunity.

296
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,100
Then you sleep on the couch,
I'll sleep in the bed!

297
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,580
No!

298
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,660
I'm going to take a shower now.

299
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,780
