00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,000
Master hid the secret manual
in such a hidden spot.

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,670
Countless people

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,390
in the stone gambling world covet

6
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,790
Master's Cloud Vision skill.

7
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,240
I imagine

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,110
he feared it falling into the wrong hands.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,110
Maybe he had a premonition

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,470
of danger,

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,120
which is why...

12
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,590
It's weird.

13
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,870
The manual doesn't mention the skill at all...

14
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,150
Young Master,

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,630
the second group of debt collectors is here.

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,990
Stop them!

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,350
At any cost, protect the Lin family!

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,210
Yes.

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,120
What to do now?

20
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,070
Young Master,

21
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,430
perhaps

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,070
there's still another way.

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,480
Gu Tingyu, also known as Master Nine,

24
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,280
is a lifelong friend of the Master

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,590
and a key figure

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,120
in Yongjing's stone gambling world.

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,550
After Master's disappearance,

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,310
Master Nine pulled many strings
to search for him,

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,910
but to no avail.

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,350
Please go and ask Master Nine
for help immediately.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,240
Don't run!

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,550
Stop!

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
Stop!

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,480
Open the gate!

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,710
I need to see Master Nine!

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,480
I need to see Master Nine!

37
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,120
- Stop!
- Don't run!

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,070
Don't run!

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
Get lost!

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,950
Do you even know where you are?

41
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,300
A beggar dares to demand to see Master Nine!

42
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,300
What are you two even doing?

43
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,650
You're nothing but a gatekeeper.

44
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,230
I'm seeing Master Nine, no matter what!

45
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,230
Over my

46
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,590
dead body!

47
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,630
Master Nine!

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,590
No way!

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,470
Keep hitting him! Beat him harder!

50
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,470
Harder!

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,190
Let him in.

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,800
(Master Nine, Supervisor of Jade Society)
What's all this noise outside?

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,240
Trying to turn Yongjing into a laughingstock?

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,190
Master, he's been shouting outside,
demanding to see you.

55
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,150
How should we handle him?

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,280
You're...

57
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,120
Lin's grandson!

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,980
I've come to pay my respects to you.

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,860
You fool!

60
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,300
Apologize to Mr. Lin's grandson, now!

61
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,140
Young Master, I'm sorry! I was wrong!

62
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,580
I'm just a gatekeeper!
I looked down on people!

63
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,460
Please, don't be angry.

64
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,140
I was wrong! I'm sorry!

65
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,990
Get out!

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,940
Come here.

67
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,420
Sit.

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,260
So you really are Lin's grandson.

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,990
You look

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,140
so much like him when he was young.

71
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,780
Finally, I've found you.

72
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,540
Master Nine, I...

73
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,020
What's the matter?

74
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,570
Are you in some kind of trouble?

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,700
Don't hesitate to speak up!

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,900
Your grandfather and I were close friends,

77
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,060
we even risked our lives for each other.

78
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,060
His grandson is like my own!

79
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,530
Master Nine,

80
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,380
I...

81
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,340
I came to ask for some money.

82
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,780
But don't worry,

83
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,900
I'll repay it.

84
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,740
No problem!

85
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,260
Until your grandfather returns,

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,060
the Lin family's business

87
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
is my business!

88
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,500
Rest assured,

89
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,530
the Lin family's debts are already settled.

90
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,620
Thank you, Master Nine!

91
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,780
Master Nine,

92
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,550
do you know

93
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,620
how my grandfather went missing?

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,460
Before your grandfather disappeared,

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,780
he went to the Gumie Public Auction.

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,420
(Live)
The auction

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,860
is just a market for stone gambling elites,

98
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,260
but every champion

99
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,420
receives an invitation to the Death Game.

100
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,020
Death Game?

101
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,140
It's organized by Guilao.

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,580
Only those who survive the Death Game

103
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,200
are qualified to open
the Xuantian Zibing stone.

104
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,140
Was Grandpa after Xuantian Zibing?

105
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,500
Normally,

106
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
he isn't someone

107
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,980
who chases fame or fortune.

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,580
I don't know why he risked it this time.

109
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
You have to know,

110
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,820
anyone who participates in the Death Game

111
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,700
either dies or is badly injured.

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,580
It's a very dangerous place.

113
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,200
I need to go to Gumie City

114
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,260
and investigate.

115
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,700
Master Nine,

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,020
I need your help.

117
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,860
Your grandfather's life or death

118
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,420
is uncertain right now.

119
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,720
If you go,

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,140
and something happens to you,

121
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,020
I won't be able to explain it
to the Lin family!

122
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
But Master Nine,

123
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,380
I just want to find my grandfather.

124
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,260
Your grandfather's disappearance

125
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,140
is closely tied to the stone gambling world.

126
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,260
I promise

127
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,700
I'll help you investigate,

128
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,310
but you should stay out of it
for your own safety.

129
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,420
But I...

130
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,300
(Guilao)

131
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,420
(Guishou)
No need to say more,

132
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,260
let her handle it.

133
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,860
Your job is

134
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,140
to assist her with everything you've got.

135
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,260
The rest is up to you.

136
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,940
Dad, look at this one!

137
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,060
It has so many surface cracks,

138
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,820
but it still could make good jade, right?

139
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,940
And this one,

140
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,380
although there's almost no pine flower,

141
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,220
what if...

142
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,860
Dad! Dad!

143
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,940
Calm down for a moment!

144
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,940
You've been pestering me day and night.

145
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,420
So this is what you've been after?

146
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,140
Yes.

147
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,820
I slacked off back then,

148
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,260
and now I've got to make up for it.

149
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,380
I carry it with me 24/7.

150
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,150
When I found you,

151
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,500
you already had that stone with you.

152
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,500
Looks like it really brought you some luck.

153
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,800
Whether it's good or bad, I'm not sure yet.

154
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,940
Grandpa's disappearance is so complicated.

155
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,100
Dad,

156
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,430
do you think I can handle this?

157
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,820
Life is short, enjoy it while you can.

158
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,940
Don't let the golden goblet
face the moon empty.

159
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,730
Du Fu wrote it well.

160
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,900
Dad,

161
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,940
if you don't know, don't name-drop.

162
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,700
That's a poem by Li Bai.

163
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,580
Young Master,

164
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,180
there's a mysterious organization
behind the Gumie Public Auction.

165
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,060
It's said that only by winning
at the Yongjing Private Club

166
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,940
and progressing through

167
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,900
higher-level auctions

168
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,860
can someone get a secret invitation.

169
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,180
Dad,

170
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,900
I'll visit you later.

171
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,940
Son,

172
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,060
do what feels right.

173
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,420
What's there to be afraid of?

174
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,900
The Jade Bar,
which appears to be a regular bar,

175
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,220
has recently become very popular

176
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,300
and is turning into the information hub
for the jade world.

177
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,340
If we can get Linda's help,
securing a pass

178
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,950
to the Yongjing Private Club
will be no problem.

179
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,980
Miss Linda is so generous.

180
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
We owe this collaboration to you!

181
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,740
Liu from the Jade Society
brought a batch of raw stones.

182
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,420
Everyone, take your time.

183
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,780
Drinks are on the house today.

184
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,740
Successful collaboration!

185
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,780
(Linda, Owner of the Jade Bar)

186
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,780
Rare guest, Young Master Liu.

187
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,420
What's wrong, Miss Linda?

188
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,940
Don't seem

189
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,060
very welcoming.

190
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,070
I wouldn't dare.

191
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,460
(Liu Xinchen, Son of President Liu)

192
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,980
Our Jade Bar

193
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
welcomes

194
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,360
everyone.

195
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,140
Miss Linda,

196
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
today,

197
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,100
I brought some top-quality raw stones.

198
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,860
I wonder if you

199
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,500
dare to accept them?

200
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,660
I only deal in information here.

201
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,540
As someone in the jade world,

202
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,390
you should have the courage
to gamble on stones.

203
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,370
Fine.

204
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,180
As long as it's a good stone,

205
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,140
I'll take it.

206
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,700
Beautiful!

207
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,940
Take a look.

208
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,180
This one has a fine texture,

209
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,660
a high gloss.

210
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,380
It should open to good jade.

211
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,540
And this one is already clear material,

212
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,620
with obvious snake skin markings.

213
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,740
It seems to be colored,

214
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,180
and the quality is quite old.

215
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,980
It's a decent piece.

216
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,500
Which one should I buy?

217
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,420
Kids make choices,

218
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,340
adults take...

219
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,340
Neither!

220
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,540
It's a guaranteed loss.

221
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,620
Who is this kid,

222
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,340
daring to talk nonsense here?

223
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,940
I'm just giving my opinion.

224
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,220
Believe it or not.

225
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,820
You are...

226
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,020
Mr. Shi Lai?

227
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
You know me?

228
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,740
Mr. Shi's reputation in Jade Street

229
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,580
is so impressive.

230
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,980
It's hard not to know you.

231
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,420
Young Master Liu,

232
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm sorry,

233
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,860
but these raw stones

234
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,020
are not for my Jade Bar.

235
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,660
Miss Linda, how can you listen to him?

236
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,860
This guy...

237
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,500
doesn't seem like someone
who understands stones.

238
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,460
You know what? He actually does.

239
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,100
Zhang, who has been
in the jade business for decades,

240
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,940
was driven out of Jade Street because of him.

241
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,150
In the stone gambling world,

242
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,700
it's not rare for a newbie

243
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,120
to guess right once or twice.

244
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,340
If you really have skill,

245
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,980
why don't you bet with me?

246
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,740
Well...

247
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,820
Great.

248
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,980
I wonder...

249
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,220
can you show me a good show?

250
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,540
Alright.

251
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,980
How do you want to gamble?

252
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,740
Look at the quality of my raw stone.

253
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,580
If you guess right,

254
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,500
you can pick any raw stone here!

255
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,220
If you guess wrong,

256
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,740
crawl through my legs.

257
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,940
Young Master Liu,

258
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,940
isn't this bet a little extreme?

259
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,980
Fine,

260
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,100
I accept.

261
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,620
But if I win,

262
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,620
I want Miss Linda
to help me with something.

263
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,220
Help with what?

264
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
I want to attend the Yongjing Private Club.

265
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm asking you to get me a pass.

266
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,460
Alright.

267
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,740
If you win,

268
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,620
I'll help you.

269
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,940
So,

270
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
when I win,

271
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,580
I'll pick the raw stone for you.

272
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,100
Deal.

273
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,220
(This stone has a fake skin,)

274
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,220
(clearly artificially polished.)

275
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,980
(Too simple.)

276
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,740
(But)

277
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,740
(the weight is strange.)

278
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,940
(Something's off.)

279
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,620
Kid,

280
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,740
you can't guess, huh?

281
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,860
You can try again.

282
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,860
You've

283
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,380
lost for sure.

284
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,620
You've faked it.

285
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,220
You wrapped two layers of skin

286
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,810
around the stone.

287
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,340
So what?

288
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,790
You still can't guess.

289
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,100
Miss Linda, can I borrow

290
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,050
