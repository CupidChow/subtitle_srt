1
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,500
=Good Luck=

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
No! I really can't take it anymore!

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,240
No! No!

5
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,750
Shi Lai, what can't you take?

6
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
Oh... nothing!

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,200
Where are they?

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,000
Linda left early.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,310
Qiao Na is resting.

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,280
Why are you still here?

11
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,640
I have something to discuss with you.

12
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,120
Miaomiao, just say it.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
Why didn't you tell me

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,920
your grandpa is Grandpa Lin?

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,510
You never asked before.

16
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,840
You joined the Private Club

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,590
because of your grandpa's disappearance?

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,070
Yes.

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,430
Then I'll help you!

20
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,640
No,

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,430
you've already helped me with the pass.

22
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,640
I'll handle the rest myself.

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,760
Don't you know?

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,870
You're not qualified for the next stage

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,120
of the Gumie Public Auction yet.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,070
Why not?

27
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,020
You topped the Private Club,
but you're not

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,510
an officially certified
stone appraiser

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,350
by the Yongjing Jade Society.

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,200
In other words,

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
you don't have the position.

32
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,640
So what should I do?

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
I'll help!

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,430
Let's go see my grandpa for assistance.

35
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,430
I've tried, it didn't work.

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,280
But if you were my boyfriend,

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,280
wouldn't the certification
be easier to get?

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,430
Not again!

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,430
No, no, no.

40
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,800
Anyway, if you're not my boyfriend,

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
Grandpa won't give you the certification.

42
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,630
So forget about the Gumie Public Auction.

43
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,630
Even if I were your boyfriend,

44
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,560
your grandpa still wouldn't
give me the certification.

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,640
That's not certain!

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,710
(This figure looks like Grandpa.)

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,710
Who are you?

48
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,630
Hello, Mr. Shi,

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
or should I say Mr. Lin.

50
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,360
I've heard of

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,800
your impressive skills
at the Private Club.

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
I want to collaborate with you.

53
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,910
Where is my grandpa?

54
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,870
Looks like you're pleased with my gift.

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,750
Listen.

56
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,680
I'll send you an address,
we'll meet and talk.

57
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,870
Who are you really?

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
I prefer peace and quiet.

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,960
You'll need to come yourself.

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
I'll wait for you for half an hour.

61
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,520
Make sure to hurry.

62
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Hello?

63
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,790
Hello!

64
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,710
Shi Lai!

65
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,870
What happened?

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,470
I'm stepping out for a while.

67
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,720
You should go home and get some rest.

68
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,080
What's so urgent that you need to go
in your pajamas?

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,470
Boss, he's here.

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,030
Mr. Shi, why the rush?

71
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
At least put on a coat,

72
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
or you'll catch a cold.

73
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,750
Go,

74
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,240
bring Mr. Shi a coat.

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
No need.

77
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,360
Who are you really?

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm Lu Jinghui.

79
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,630
So you're the CEO of Lu Group,

80
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,470
Lu Jinghui.

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,630
Didn't expect him to be a cripple, huh?

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Please, have a seat.

83
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,470
My brother has some past issues with you.

84
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,630
He's

85
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,800
too arrogant.

86
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,470
I apologize on his behalf.

87
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
No need.

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,910
I want to know about the photo

89
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,800
and what you know about my grandpa.

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,390
Don't rush.

91
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,800
Master Lin Jiang,
our Jade Society's supervisor,

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,920
has mentored me.

93
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,920
Since his disappearance,

94
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,070
I've used all connections to find him,

95
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,630
and there's been

96
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,190
some progress.

97
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,800
Then tell me,

98
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
where was the photo taken?

99
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
Mr. Shi,

100
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,120
Lu Group really needs someone like you,

101
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,920
a talented stone appraiser.

102
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,630
If we go from rivals to partners,

103
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I'll tell you everything.

104
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,190
(I've heard Lu Jinghui is a master
at managing relations.)

105
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,800
(He took control of Lu Group
in under three years,)

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,480
(dominating 90%
of the northern jade market.)

107
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
(Now, he's recruiting me)

108
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,920
(to help him invade the western market.)

109
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,190
(Helping him)

110
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,800
(could hurt Miaomiao…)

111
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,510
Also, if you want to participate
in the Gumie Public Auction,

112
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,850
you need the Jade Society's
official certification,

113
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,040
and I'm the secretary-general.

114
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,750
I can give you that certification anytime.

115
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,870
If you can give me
valid clues about my grandpa

116
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,000
and help with the certification,

117
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,680
I'll help you with stone appraisal.

118
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
Great.

119
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,920
I like straightforward people!

120
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,120
So can you tell me

121
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,360
where the photo

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
was taken?

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,870
It was taken last week
in a small town in Gumie City.

124
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,560
My people

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,850
haven't found Supervisor Lin's
exact location yet,

126
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,820
but

127
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,430
they found some

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,310
interesting clues.

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,430
Which town, which street?

130
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,510
Give me the details!

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,070
What stone do you want me to appraise?

132
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,350
Mr. Shi,

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,630
being a stone appraiser means
having a sharp eye

134
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
and the ability to keep secrets.

135
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,680
Recently, Gu Yunmiao
wants to sell a raw stone

136
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,070
to a big client from Yunmian.

137
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,310
The warehouse is full of

138
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,560
mixed stones,

139
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,560
and with her inexperience,

140
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,310
she might

141
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,750
pick a

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,870
fake raw stone.

143
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
You want me to choose a fake stone

144
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
for her?

145
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,240
That'll damage Feishang Group's reputation,

146
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,360
and then your Lu family

147
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,310
can monopolize the western market.

148
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,800
You misunderstood, Mr. Shi.

149
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,310
I just want you to

150
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,680
do nothing.

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,430
My grandpa taught me

152
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,870
to have principles.

153
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,430
The Gu family helped me,

154
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,000
so I won't stand by.

155
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,270
Also,

156
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,430
I warn you,

157
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,920
stop thinking about dirty tricks.

158
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,360
You really misunderstood.

159
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
But

160
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,750
as the rumors go,

161
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,070
you're Miss Gu's boyfriend.

162
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,920
Your relationship seems special.

163
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,430
We're just friends.

164
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,560
I don't betray my friends.

165
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,240
As for my grandpa's disappearance,

166
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,430
I'll figure it out.

167
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,310
Wait a moment.

168
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,000
Let me tell you,

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,120
the photo with Master Lin Jiang was taken

170
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,920
in a store owned by Feishang Group.

171
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
Could Miss Gu have another motive

172
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,850
for being close to you?

173
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,120
I don't need your concerns.

174
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,510
This Shi Lai really doesn't know

175
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,630
what's good for him.

176
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,240
I didn't expect him
to have such a stubborn attitude,

177
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,870
just like his grandpa.

178
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,270
Brother,

179
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
now that we can't use him,

180
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,120
should we just destroy him?

181
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,870
You never learn.

182
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,360
You always rush things.

183
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,710
Brother,

184
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,870
is there still hope?

185
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,000
First, we forged the photo,

186
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,360
then sowed discord between him
and the Gu family.

187
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,560
But this guy

188
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,870
won't believe us!

189
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Actually...

190
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,070
you didn't expect him to believe it.

191
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,320
You just need evidence that he was here.

192
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Right,

193
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,510
Mr. Lu?

194
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,200
This is all thanks to
Miss Linda's suggestion.

195
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,390
So, what's next?

196
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,550
I just provide information.

197
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,870
How you use the tip

198
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,120
about the Yunmian client

199
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,000
is up to you.

200
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Could

201
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,790
the Gu family and grandpa's disappearance

202
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,120
be connected?

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Maybe

204
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,870
Lu Jinghui is trying to

205
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,750
drive a wedge between Miaomiao and me.

206
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
But the Jade Society…

207
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,780
(Jade)
These events

208
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,930
are tied to it.

209
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,830
(Lu Family)
Grandpa's disappearance disrupted

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,550
(Supervisor of Gu Family; President Liu)
the balance among the major families,

211
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,550
(Zhao Family; Vice President)
and someone's trying to profit from it.

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,480
The situation is complicated,

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,800
and it's hard to discern truth from lies.

214
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,510
No one can be trusted easily.

215
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,750
There's danger everywhere.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,630
Countless people covet the manual.

217
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,150
Even if I can protect it for now,

218
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,630
I can't protect it forever.

219
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,000
Maybe I should memorize it

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,480
and burn it.

221
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,630
Pick angular ones. Stick to principles.

222
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,270
Overlook no details.

223
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,360
Pick angular ones. Stick to principles.

224
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,700
Pick angular ones. Stick to principles.

225
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,720
The highest quality.

226
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,720
The highest quality. The highest quality.

227
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,240
Bluestones with two layers of skin.

228
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,390
Bluestones with two layers of skin.

229
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,360
Outside blue, inside clear.
The highest quality.

230
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,820
The highest quality.

231
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,080
This manual holds Grandpa's life's work,

232
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
a priceless treasure.

233
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,840
As expected of my young master!

234
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,790
Finally memorized
the Stone Appraisal Manual.

235
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,440
With it,

236
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,200
I can become unstoppable like Grandpa.

237
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,260
(Cloud Vision. Sharpen your eyes and ears.
Do not neglect any details.)

238
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,500
(No manual any more. I've burned it.
Send)

239
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,860
(Shi Lai:
No manual any more. I've burned it.)

240
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,510
The so-called Cloud Vision…

241
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,750
The so-called Cloud Vision…

242
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
The so-called Cloud Vision…

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,390
The so-called Cloud Vision…

244
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,100
(Linda)

245
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,360
An opportunity's here.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,870
Call me "sister"

247
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
or regret it later.

248
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,630
Hung up.

249
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,150
The Jade Society's
official certification exam

250
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,390
starts in 30 minutes.

251
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,240
Instead of seeking shortcuts,

252
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,470
how about you…

253
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,220
(Jade Society Stone Appraiser Exam)

254
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,750
Where's your admission ticket?

255
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,390
What ticket?

256
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,230
Going through the "backdoor"?

257
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,320
Walk 100 meters ahead,

258
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,610
turn right, then right again, and again,

259
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
you'll be there.

260
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,300
So I can enter the exam room
from the backdoor?

261
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,560
Got it.

262
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,510
You're seeking shortcuts

263
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,630
and still going to the exam room?

264
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,750
I'm clever and gifted.

265
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,770
I can rely on myself.

266
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,870
You know what?

267
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,270
No admission ticket, no entry!

268
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,660
Are you impersonating someone?

269
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,460
(Admission Ticket)

270
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,540
Once, I had a genuine invitation

271
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,100
but didn't cherish it.

272
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,940
Now that I've lost it,
I regret it deeply.

273
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,800
