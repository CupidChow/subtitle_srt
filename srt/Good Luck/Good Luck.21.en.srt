(Judging Panel)

4
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,750
This one looks of good quality.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,350
It's from the Mowanji Quarry,
full green Heiwusha.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,480
I bid one million!

7
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,970
One million?

8
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,200
Grandpa, that acquisition price is high.

9
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,120
But it's still within
the auction's estimated price range.

10
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,640
This shows the importance of power.

11

Contestants with backing

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,200
- can gain support from their factions,
- I'll be right there.

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,920
and within the rules,

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,950
they can get the most favorable offers,

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,840
building a huge advantage.

16
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,200
Grandpa,

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
can we help Shi Lai?

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,200
If we help, wouldn't that be unfair

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
to contestants without such backing?

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,560
This challenge, he must face it
on his own.

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Shi Lai,

22
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,240
what are you waiting for?

23
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,030
(Whatever!)

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
(What?)

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
(That dude is still there?)

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,560
(What does he want?)

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,470
(He seems ready to make a move.)

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,470
(What is he planning?)

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
(If he finds out I'm picking up money,)

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,370
(will it be too embarrassing?)

31
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,680
(He noticed me.)

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,630
(Is he trying to hide his intentions,)

33
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,900
(so I can't spot his weaknesses?)

34
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,310

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,430
(I'm the biggest threat to him.)

37
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,960
(Is this guy sick? Why isn't he leaving?)

38
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,080
(Did he forget his money too?)

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,150
(If he doesn't move, I won't either!)

40
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,910
I can't wait anymore!

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,910
It's already over?

Yes!

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,750
I didn't expect anyone would come.

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,120
These are all from very new quarries,

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
nothing special.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,680
They said it's to show equality,

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,100
and brought me in to fill the spots.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,490
I didn't expect
someone would actually buy.

52
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,650
Wait a moment!

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,120
I can't find my card reader.

54
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,750
No need for the card reader,
I'll pay in cash.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,840
(What is he planning?)

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Cash.

57
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,400
Alright, I'll introduce them.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,710
These are two thousand each,

59
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,400

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Highly recommended.

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,910
This pile here is one thousand each,

62
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,120
pretty good too.

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
And this one's five hundred each,

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
really cheap.

65
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,280
So what do you want?

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,840
What's your plan?

67
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,390
Little brother,

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,480
these small scraps of raw stones
are even less valuable.

69
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,680
Even if you can cut some jade from them,
it's not worth much.

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,240
Why bother buying them?

71
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,830
I know.

72
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,920

73
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,120
One?

74
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,110
Which one?

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
This one.

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
This one… 30 yuan.

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,360
Make it cheaper, boss!

78
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,150
It's only 30, and you're haggling?

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Is that reasonable?

80
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,700
As long as it doesn't exceed fifty yuan,
it's all reasonable.

81
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,640
Name your price.

I'll swallow this raw pebble.

Fine, I'll take your bet.

Mr. Yuanzhi,

140
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,800
Shi Lai's actions are a bit unexpected.

141
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,800
Maybe he's under too much pressure

142
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
and is giving up.

143
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,360
Does he really think he can win

144
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,390
the Gumie Public Auction
with just twenty yuan?

145
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,270
Twenty yuan to win
the Gumie Public Auction?

146
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
He might as well

147
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,910
try to buy Times Square
with twenty yuan,

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,550
maybe that's easier!

149
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
(I don't have enough funds.)

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,150
(To win quickly,)

151
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,150
(I need to keep picking
the best raw stones.)

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,720
(So my money grows exponentially.)

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
(I wonder if my small black stone
can hold up.)

154
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,390
(I only have two thousand yuan now,)

155
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,000
(and I need at least twenty thousand)

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,030
(for low-tier raw stones!)

157
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,550
(The top-tier raw stones are worth)

158
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,390
(over fifty million!)

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,630
(It's an impossible mission!)

160
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,080
(How could I forget to bring my money?!)

161
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,510
Shi Lai just gave the victory sign!

162
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,510
Does he really think
he can win the Gumie Public Auction

163
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,030
with just two thousand yuan?

164
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,030
No, no! It's not like that!

168
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,030
No, no, no.

169
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,150
What's going on?

170
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,590
He's losing it.

171
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,800
No, no, no!

172
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,150
It's not like that!

173
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,030
No!

174
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,440
Not like that!

No, no, no!

176
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,150
No, no, no! Not like that!

177
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,080

179
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,670
to deal with this trash?

180
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,510
I thought I would have to think hard
to deal with you,

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,270

185
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,600

187
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,550
you're wrong this time.

188
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,790
I have nothing to do with it.

189
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,080
I really want to know

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,630
what made Shi Lai do such a stupid thing.

191
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,000
Maybe… he has a different plan.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,670
But he should win first.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,030
I believe in him.

194
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,030
He'll create a miracle.

195
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,000
Shi Lai,

196
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,790
what are you trying to do?

197
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,200
But now, I can only trust you.

198
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,390
(What on earth is going on here?)

199
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,910
(Why?)

200
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,150
How unlucky!

201
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,950
I finally had a contestant
come to my stall,

202
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,550
hoping to raise my status,

203
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,030
but he's a madman!

204
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,550
What are you doing?

205
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,550
You didn't lose your mind too, did you?

206
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,390
(Why?)

207
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,320
(What is happening here?)

208
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,630
The guy who wants to create a miracle
is back again.

209
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,280
I'll take this one!

210
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,970
Sure.

211
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,320
Five thousand.

212
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,630
You don't mind, right?

213
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,910
Didn't you just say two thousand?

214
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,150
I set the price for my stones!

215
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,000
If you won't buy, leave!

216
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,200
Isn't this against the rules?

217
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,750
As long as the raw stone here
is under five thousand,

218
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,510
the vendor can set any price.

219
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,630
Fine.

220
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,750
Let's create a miracle.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Which pile has
the two-thousand-yuan stones?

222
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,860
(Past Champion)

223
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,630
(This isn't right.)

224
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,000
(It's so small and cheap…)

225
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,910
(What's really going on?)

226
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,100
- Cut! Cut!
- Glassy jadeite!

227
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,110
Congratulations!

228
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,030
I'm going to be rich!

229
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,230
Thank God!

230
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,610
(Failed again.)

231
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,940
(Rank 19: Shi Lai)

232
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,100
(Gumie Public Auction Rankings)

233
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,380
(Rank 10: Shi Lai)

234
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,670
Just a clown.

235
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,180
(Top-tier Raw Stone)

236
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,150
Dong!

237
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,670
Is Dong the first to enter
the top-tier raw stone zone?!

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
The more premium the raw stone,
the higher the price,

239
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,550
and the more valuable the jade will be.

240
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,150
The final three raw stones
that decide the winner

241
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,080
will definitely come from
the top-tier raw stone zone.

242
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,200
Dong, listen carefully.

243
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,150
Shi Lai's rank is climbing quickly now.

244
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,000
You have to find a way to stop him.

245
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,630
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

246
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,750
As long as I win the championship,

247
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,150
he's just a joke.

248
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,990
You don't understand.

249
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,320
You've never faced him.

250
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,270
But he's really way below me, Mr. Lu.

251
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,910
I don't need to target him, do I?

252
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,390
Follow my instructions!

253
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,550
You must

254
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,910
stop him now.

255
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,200
Don't forget what you promised me.

256
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,550
Think carefully about

257
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,910
whether you still need

258
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,390
the Jade Society's protection
for your business.

259
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,620
(Top-tier Raw Stone)

260
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,670
Dong, just as he was about to enter
the top-tier raw stone zone,

261
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,910
(Mid-tier Raw Stone)
he turned toward…

262
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,550
the mid-tier raw stone zone?

263
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,630
Dong entered the mid-tier raw stone zone.

264
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,080
His target is…

265
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,630
Shi Lai?

266
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,750
As expected, only elites
come to compete here,

267
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,050
leaving me
with hardly any good stones left.

268
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,390
I want this one!

269
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,670
- 3.2 million.
- Okay.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
