00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,460
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,470
There's a recording inside.

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,680
Tell me,

5
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,000
what did it say?

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,450
Sun...

7
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,570
Sun Wukong said...

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,670
Sun Wukong said...

9
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,320
"It's just a piece of stone."

10
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,560
I've finally found you!

11
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,710
You really are my grandson!

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,840
You really are my grandson!

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,500
I've been looking for you
all these years,

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,640
and I've finally found you!

15
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,070
Kid,

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,430
it's because of me
that your were blinded.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,710
What did Guilao do to you?

18
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,790
Grandpa!

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,310
You've suffered so much these years!

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,350
You've become skinny.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,640
You've become skinny!

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,030
It's okay.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,200
It'll be alright.

24
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,550
It's okay.

25
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
It'll be all right.

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,750
We'll definitely get out of here.

27
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,630
Definitely.

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
And we'll treat our eyes.

29
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,270
Alright?

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
My grandson!

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,080
I always dream about you!

32
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,550
I...

33
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,080
I've made you suffer!

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm so sorry!

35
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,280
Bravo.

36
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,520
It's been a long time since I've seen
such a touching family drama.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
Guilao?!

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
Yes.

39
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,000
Aren't you both grateful to me?

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
One is looking for a grandson,

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,470
and the other is
looking for a grandfather.

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,910
Now, I've helped both of you
fulfill your wishes!

43
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,470
How about giving me
the Cloud Vision Skill as a reward?

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Guilao,

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,280
do you really think you're in control?

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Otherwise?

47
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,150
You two are barely surviving,

48
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,590
and what good
is the Cloud Vision Skill now?

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,360
Do you really think

50
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,360
I was alone in the Death Game?

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,800
No one knows your whereabouts,

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
which is why you're so difficult
to deal with.

53
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,670
Once people know your location,

54
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,970
your little tricks will be nothing!

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:52,800
Help!

56
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,520
Isn't it strange

57
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,400
that the tracker's alarm

58
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,400
is going off here?

59
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,630
Where is it?

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,190
I'm sure I left it here.

61
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,790
Shi Lai?

62
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,450
Master arranged for us
to come pick you up, Miss.

63
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,620
Okay...

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,120
Stupid!

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,630
So stupid!

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Master...

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Master Nine?!

68
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,200
Laojiu...

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
Laojiu?

70
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Yes,

71
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,750
I'm Guilao.

72
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,470
Laojiu.

73
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,710
But why?

74
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,640
Why?!

75
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,870
You still have the nerve to ask me why?

76
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,440
Well,

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,750
your grandson
still doesn't know anything.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,630
Then let me explain.

79
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,150
Decades ago,

80
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,000
there were two genius young men
in the jade world.

81
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,120
One was wildly praised,

82
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,240
and the other was completely ignored,

83
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,680
even treated like just a lackey!

84
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,270
Why?!

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,430
Wasn't it because
you had the Cloud Vision Skill,

86
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,560
and I had nothing?!

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,430
And you,

88
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,680
with the Cloud Vision Skill,

89
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,120
we could have gone together
to cut open the Xuantian Zibing stone!

90
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,590
Laojiu.

91
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Shut up!

92
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,430
I'm not done talking yet.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
And then

94
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,780
what happened?!

95
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,500
Laojiu!

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,630
- Laojiu.
- Lin Jiang!

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,780
Lin Jiang,

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,450
we can finally cut open
the Xuantian Zibing stone!

99
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,000
Laojiu, I have a son now.

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
I have a son!

101
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,560
No, I need to go back quickly.

102
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,270
But...

103
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,500
what about the Xuantian Zibing stone?

104
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,780
There will be another chance.

105
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,760
Laojiu, I have a son now,

106
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,240
aren't you happy for me?

107
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,870
I have a son!

108
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,540
(Life)

109
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,140
(Death)

110
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,430
Unlike you,

111
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,750
I don't have the Cloud Vision Skill.

112
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,750
Opportunities for me

113
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,870
only come once,

114
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,750
and I can't let it slip away!

115
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,910
Laojiu, did you...?

116
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,790
Yes!

117
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
I went to the Death Game alone!

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,840
I give up.

119
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
I admit defeat!

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
How disgraceful!

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
Please!

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,950
Please let me take one more look
at Xuantian Zibing stone!

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,840
I beg you!

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
I beg you!

125
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,890
Enough!

126
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,360
How shameful!

127
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,430
I thought I would meet
Cloud Vision Lin Jiang,

128
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,190
but instead, I find you, a useless fool.

129
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,560
Just based on you,

130
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,310
you think you can join Cloud Vision Lin Jiang
in the jade world?

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Get lost!

132
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,190
Please!

133
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,310
Please,

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,310
just let me see Xuantian Zibing stone!

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,050
I beg you!

136
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,620
I beg you...

137
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Laojiu.

138
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,310
Don't call me that!

139
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,140
Master Nine.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,190
That's all?

141
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,800
That's all?!

142
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,430
You say it so casually!

143
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
The Lin family has
the Cloud Vision Skill,

144
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,310
you were at the top from the start,

145
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,510
being whorshiped by everyone!

146
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,430
But Lin Jiang, don't forget,

147
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm a genius too.

148
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm a genius who's no worse than you!

149
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,790
You just have the Cloud Vision Skill,
that's all!

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,550
You had the Cloud Vision Skill,

151
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,240
but what did you do with it?!

152
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,750
You won't even go to
the Gumie Public Auction?

153
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,390
No, I'm not.

154
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,150
I want to be with my family.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
I advise you,

156
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,670
fame isn't everything,

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,080
life is the most important.

158
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,780
But...

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,850
Given our long friendship,

160
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,740
can you teach me the Cloud Vision Skill?

161
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
I want to make a name for myself
at the Gumie Public Auction.

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,360
Why do you need to learn it?

163
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,550
With your ability,

164
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,590
you don't need it.

165
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,470
I gotta go.

166
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,870
You keep saying you're returning to life,

167
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,960
you don't care about fame,

168
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,450
but...

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,230
why won't you teach me
the Cloud Vision Skill?

170
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,800
Don't you think
you're being hypocritical?

171
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,680
You're being unreasonable!

172
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,960
The Cloud Vision Skill is ours,
from the Lin family!

173
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
Why do we have to teach it to you?

174
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,870
Yeah,

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,750
the Cloud Vision Skill
is indeed yours, Lin Jiang!

176
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,130
You rose to fame because of it!

177
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,600
You get to enjoy life

178
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,870
because no matter when,

179
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,360
you're Cloud Vision Lin Jiang.

180
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,800
But I'm different,

181
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
if I don't make a move,

182
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,750
I'll always be your lackey!

183
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,360
I beg you!

184
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,630
I beg you!

185
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
I beg you!

186
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
I beg you!

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,750
I beg you!

188
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,680
Please!

189
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Please!

190
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,870
I'll do anything!

191
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,240
I just want to see Xuantian Zibing stone!

192
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,870
You had the Cloud Vision Skill,

193
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,030
and I could only look up to you.

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,000
I finally realized,
if I didn't change my way of life,

195
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,870
I'd forever be treated as your lackey.

196
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,510
Fifty years...

197
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
A full fifty years!

198
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,480
I painstakingly worked to get to
the position of Guilao.

199
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
Laojiu.

200
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,030
Fifty years!

201
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,270
I've lived two identities
for fifty years!

202
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
It's you, Lin Jiang!

203
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,020
It's you, Lin Jiang, who ruined my life!

204
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
But it's fine now.

205
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,110
Now,

206
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,430
I'm going to get your Cloud Vision Skill.

207
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,600
What are you laughing at?!

208
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,630
Enough with the nonsense.

209
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,080
After all this talk,

210
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,360
isn't it just for the Cloud Vision Skill?

211
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,480
You make yourself sound so pitiful,

212
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,960
but it's just an excuse to steal

213
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,120
from others!

214
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,350
In the end,

215
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,240
you're just a robber!

216
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,120
I will never give the Cloud Vision Skill
to a robber!

217
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,230
If you have the guts,

218
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,670
kill me.

219
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,120
If you kill me,

220
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,000
the Cloud Vision Skill will be gone.

221
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,510
Don't rush,

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,510
your despair is just beginning.

223
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,780
I've heard...

224
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,750
that when someone is suffocating,

225
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,480
they can see things
ordinary people can't.

226
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,930
Tell me

227
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,870
what you can see.

228
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,510
What are you doing to him?!

229
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,750
Don't you feel it?

230
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,750
I'm torturing him.

231
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,390
Just come at me!

232
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,680
You?

233
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,480
You can't handle this.

234
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Still have the strength?

235
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Well,
you can last a little longer.

236
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
You should blame

237
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,720
your Cloud Vision Skill,
it's only half-baked!

238
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,030
Otherwise, why would I torture you,

239
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,720
forcing your grandfather to speak?

240
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,150
But it's fine,

241
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,390
you're young,

242
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,480
your body can take it.

243
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,860
Lin Yun. Lin Yun!

244
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,110
Lin Yun!

245
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,510
A person can suffocate to death
in three minutes.

246
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,750
He has...

247
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,360
two and a half minutes left.

248
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,840
Lin Yun!

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,840
Lin Yun!

250
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
Lin Yun,

251
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,010
how are you?

252
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,700
Still moving.

253
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,500
Relax.

254
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,460
Lin Yun!

255
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,570
Lin Yun!

256
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,140
Lin Yun!

257
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,370
No!

258
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,770
Lin Yun!

259
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,150
