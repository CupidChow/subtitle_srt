00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,480
Shi Lai,

4
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
what's going on?

5
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,450
It's probably a power outage.
I'll check.

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,480
Miaomiao, are you okay?

7
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,530
Miaomiao!

8
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,310
Miaomiao, I...

9
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,590
How do you think I look?

10
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,000
Stop pretending

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
and answer me!

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,200
Good! Very good!

13
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,180
You really saw everything, didn't you!

14
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,100
I…

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,310
should I say I didn't see anything?

16
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,040
You took advantage of everything,

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,350
and now you say you didn't see anything!

18
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,840
What do you want me to say?

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,310
The princess is upset!

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
Sleep!

21
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,710
Linda,

22
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,870
don't you know

23
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,840
what Guilao will do to him?

24
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,860
Don't worry about it.

25
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,780
I'll prove it myself.

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,090
Remember,

27
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,600
if you fail,

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,560
your position will be mine.

Nothing yet.

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,960
We've visited seven auction houses.

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,680
We've searched the entire city.

35
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,430
Don't get discouraged,

36
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,430
we'll find it.

37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,710
That's sweet.

Excuse me.

41

The Lotus Jade...

42
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,080
(Lotus Jade)
Sir,

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,630
the item has already been purchased.

44
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,680
Who bought it?

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Well...

46
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,360
You'd better not mess with her.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,200
What do you mean?

48
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,380
In Gumie City,

49
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,160
those who cross her don't end up well.

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,420
You can't even mention her name?

51
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,540
Well...

52
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,240
The Queen of Gumie.

53

The Queen of Gumie

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,430
isn't someone you can just meet!

55
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm the descendant
of Cloud Vision Lin Jiang.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm Shi Lai.

57
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,830
Shi Lai, descendant of Lin Jiang,

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,850
asks to see the Queen of Gumie.

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,820
Please, come in!

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,290
Come in!

61
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,720
What do you mean by this?

62
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,900
The Queen of Gumie has ordered that

63
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,510
only he may enter.

64
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,900
No one else.

65
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,430
You listen carefully.

66
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,950
He, Shi Lai,

67
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,430
is my boyfriend,

68
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,000
Miss Gu Yunmiao of Feishang Group.

69
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,320
I'm not just anyone.

70
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,510
Still can't go in!

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,670
- How dare you!
- Miaomiao.

72
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,920
Wait for me at the hotel.

73
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,070
Don't worry.

74
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,830
I'll make sure to get the Lotus Jade back.

75
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,510
Stay safe.

76
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,980
I will.

77
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,000
I told you,

78
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,270
that wouldn't be our last meeting.

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
Linda?

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,950
You're the Queen?

81
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,570
Aren't you the Jade Bar's...

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Wherever there's jade, there I am.

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
How else

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,390
would I gather information?

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Shi Lai,

86
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,800
did you come

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,620
looking for me on purpose?

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
I…

89
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,200
am...

90
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,040
No, I…

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
Not even a greeting,

92
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,270
and you want to take
the Lotus Jade from me?

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Don't you remember

94
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,680
what I do?

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,950
Looks like you know.

96
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
The Qianluo Lotus Jade

97
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,360
is Miaomiao's mother's relic.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
I want to return it
to its rightful owner.

99
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,900
How much did you bid for it?

100
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,760
We'll pay double.

101
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm not lacking money.

102
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,250
Besides, Miss Gu

103
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,480
doesn't like me.

104
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,480
Why should I help her?

105
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,830
Can you

106
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,040
make an exception

107
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,270
for me?

108
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Please, dear sister?

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,370
It seems Miss Gu

110
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,140
is very important to you.

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,090
I treat her like my own sister.

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,600
And I know

113
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,480
how much

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,510
a relic means

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,350
to an orphan.

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
Do you know

117
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,040
that you're important

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,260
to me too?

119
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
Linda,

120
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,270
don't do this.

121
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,600
Now you're being a bit narcissistic.

122
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm not moved.

123
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm interested

124
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,120
only in your abilities.

125
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,450
During King Mu of Zhou's reign,

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
the Western Huns

127
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,160
offered a moonlit full cup.

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,830
Everyone thought

129
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,220
it was the moonlight,

130
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,110
but little did they know,

131
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,600
the Qianluo Lotus Jade

132
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,010
itself glowed

133
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,830
in the cup.

134
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,160
Here,

135
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,820
you must follow my rules

136
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,260
and play my game.

137
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,050
You have only one chance.

138
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,880
If you win,

139
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,120
the Lotus Jade

140
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,980
is yours.

141
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,230
Deal.

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,360
These are my rare spirits.

143
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,750
If you can drink them all,

144
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,310
the Lotus Jade is yours.

145
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,390
(Didn't expect you
to have such good tolerance.)

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
(Tonight,)

147
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,030
(you're mine.)

148
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,150
If I had another choice,

149
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,840
I wouldn't do this to you.

150
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,510
Do you know Cloud Vision Skill?

151
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,030
Do you know Cloud Vision Skill?

152
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,390
I don't.

153
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,440
I don't know.

154
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,910
What is Cloud Vision Skill?

155
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,870
A set of tricks.

156
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,750
Tricks?

157
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,220
If you believe, it's real.

158
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,550
If you don't, it's fake.

159
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,750
What does that mean?

160
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,790
Just...

161
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,910
Just a stone.

162
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,630
(Stone?)

163
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,790
(What stone?)

164
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,820
(Could the truth powder not be working?)

165
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,750
(That can't be!)

166
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,630
What's your name?

167
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,390
Shi Lai.

168
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,380
Do you like me?

169
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,440
I do.

170
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,630
If…

171
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,000
both Gu Yunmiao and I
fell into the water,

172
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,150
who would you save first?

173
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I'll save you.

174
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
Miss, don't be afraid.

175
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,640
I'll save you.

176
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,300
Miss, don't be afraid.

177
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,620
I'll save you.

178
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,840
