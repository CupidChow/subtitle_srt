00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,430
Don't come closer!

4
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,590
Don't come closer!

5
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,680
Don't come!

6
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,810
Miss,

7
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,650
don't be afraid.

8
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,590
I'll save you.

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,230
Run, Miss!

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Hurry!

11
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't worry about me!

12
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,080
Why hasn't he come back yet?

13
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,990
Could something have happened?

14
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,800
No.

15
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,960
I need to check on him.

16
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,190
Do not monitor me again

17
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,680
unless you want to die.

18
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Enough.

19
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,380
Don't make any more small moves.

20
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,400
Linda,

21
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,950
have you figured out

22
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,120
the Cloud Vision Skill?

23
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
Shi Lai says he doesn't know.

24
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,000
I've checked,

25
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,160
and there's no sign
of Cloud Vision on him.

26
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,560
Could the truth powder not work on him?

27
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
Lin Jiang's old body can't last forever.

28
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,390
I don't have much time left!

29
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,120
What kind of queen's club is this?

30
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,300
Pretending to have strong security,

31
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,070
but it's nothing impressive.

32
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,980
- I'm not afraid.
- What are you doing?

33
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,360
Hurry up!

34
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,480
Room 520 needs to be cleaned!

35
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
I'll go now.

36
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,270
Not that way.

37
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
Follow me.

38
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,110
What are you doing?

39
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,480
You're not one of our staff.

40
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,800
There's no Room 520.

41
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,880
Who are you?

42
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,600
What's your real intention here?

43
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,680
Listen up,

44
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm Miss Gu from Feishang Group!

45
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,480
I'm just here to pick up my things.

46
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,950
Get out of the way for your own good!

47
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,800
Otherwise, you'll regret it!

48
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,500
Feishang Group?

49
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Do you think you can just dream?

50
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,840
You're just a waitress.

51
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,070
Get off me!

52
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,920
Don't touch me!

53
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,580
Don't mess with me! Or I will...

54
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,180
Let go of me!

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,830
- Let go of me! Don't touch me!
- Miaomiao?

56
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Let go of me!

57
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
- "Or"?
- Don't touch me!

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,830
Or you will do what?

59
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Let go!

60
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,360
Let go of me!

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,640
Get off me!

62
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,480
Get off...

63
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
her.

64
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,100
Shi Lai!

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,270
That thug was bullying me.

66
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,920
I've been hurt.

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,000
Where are you hurt?

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,440
What about him?

69
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,290
Him? Just self-defense.

70
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,120
Breaking fingers, poking eyes, kicking.

71
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,720
You're asking for trouble!

72
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,360
- I won't let this go!
- Laosi!

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
What are you doing?

74
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,110
Miss Linda...

75
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,270
I...

76
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,830
I caught an outsider pretending to be

77
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,920
part of our staff.

78
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,480
So,

79
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,910
you had bad intentions?

80
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
No... I didn't mean that.

81
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,120
Do you think my club

82
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,820
is a place for you
to do whatever you want?

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
I...

84
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,060
Miss Linda!

85
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,900
I was wrong!

86
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,160
I was so wrong!

87
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,320
Please forgive me, Miss Linda!

88
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,120
Please, Miss Linda!

89
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,380
- Get lost!
- I was wrong!

90
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,480
I was wrong, Miss Linda!

91
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
Please, Miss Linda! Spare me!

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,050
Miss Linda!

93
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,160
Please, Miss Linda!

94
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,800
So, you're the Queen of Gumie.

95
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Miss Gu,

96
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I'm really sorry,

97
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,650
I didn't manage things well

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
and caused you trouble.

99
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,390
But Miss Gu,

100
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,920
why are you wearing my staff uniform?

101
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
I thought the uniform looked nice,

102
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,600
so I tried it on.

103
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,110
Well,

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
if you like it,

105
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,580
I'll send you a few sets later.

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
No need.

107
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,500
I tried it on

108
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
and didn't think much of it.

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,480
Maybe it's because
my staff has such great figures,

110
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,160
and the clothes

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
don't fit you well.

112
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,160
- You...!
- Let me take her back first.

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,440
Let's go!

114
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,680
- Take me back first?
- Miaomiao!

115
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,040
Are you coming back here?

116
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
Your hand is injured.

117
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,220
Let me bandage it.

118
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,200
No need.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,550
It'll heal soon.

120
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Look.

121
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,870
What's this?

122
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,870
The Lotus Jade?

123
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,500
Were you playing dress-up?

124
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,800
I was worried about you.

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,140
Who knew what you were up to?

126
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,160
I was worried about you.

127
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,720
This place is unfamiliar to you,
and I was afraid

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,690
you'd get into trouble.

129
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,480
The most dangerous thing here
is that woman!

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Linda

131
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,240
is hard to understand.

132
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,270
Is she an enemy or a friend?

133
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,560
It's complicated.

134
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,990
So, you like complicated women?

135
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,360
I didn't mean it like that!

136
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm just trying to help you
get the Lotus Jade back.

137
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
I know

138
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,050
how much you want it,

139
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,500
just like

140
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,870
I want to find my grandpa.

141
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,970
Shi Lai, you're really kind.

142
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,720
It's been a long time
since anyone treated me this well.

143
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,910
Miss Gu, don't make yourself
out to be so pitiful.

144
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Don't say that!

145
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't you know?

146
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,030
People in the company

147
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,120
only flatter me

148
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,030
because of my status.

149
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,030
I have a bad temper,

150
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
so they probably

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,610
talk behind my back.

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,270
You do

153
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,240
have a temper,

154
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,720
but I know

155
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,870
you're straightforward and kind-hearted.

156
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,600
You don't have that arrogance
rich people often have.

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,750
Your little temper

158
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,910
is even kind of cute.

159
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,670
I like that. Go on.

160
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,790
Are you saying sweet things
to Linda like this too?

161
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,440
No! Absolutely not!

162
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,270
So, you admit you say sweet things to me?

163
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,110
I...

164
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,550
My mom said

165
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,080
the Lotus Jade should go to

166
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,250
someone I trust.

167
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,750
This... this

168
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,730
doesn't feel right.

169
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,150
Just take it.

170
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,420
(Vice President, President)

171
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,000
Without Liu here,

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,870
it's quiet.

173
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,870
Isn't it better this way?

174
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,150
Too many people just make it noisy.

175
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,270
Don't forget Master Nine.

176
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,180
Do you know Shi Lai is going to
the Gumie Public Auction?

177
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,470
I do.

178
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,540
He's going for the Death Game

179
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,220
to find Lin Jiang.

180
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,790
But that place...

181
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,980
we should stay away from it.

182
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,200
But Shi Lai is getting closer
to the Gu family.

183
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
If he wins this time,

184
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,390
and with the power of being a champion
in the Death Game,

185
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,030
he could inherit Lin Jiang's position.

186
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,280
And with Master Nine's help...

187
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,870
The Death Game

188
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,910
isn't that easy.

189
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,670
Most people come back

190
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,870
crippled.

191
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,390
Why bother

192
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,450
provoking it?

193
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,070
But what if he succeeds?

194
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,790
Who could suppress his reputation then?

195
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,320
Don't you still have your ace, Dong?

196
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,670
In the Gumie

197
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,790
Public Auction,

198
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,110
with us working together,

199
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,270
we can crush Shi Lai,

200
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,710
never letting him rise again.

201
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,150
Then,

202
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,030
we can tear apart the Gu family.

203
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,530
We'll split the market

204
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,390
they leave behind.

205
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,750
It's said that Xuantian Zibing
is the world's number one raw stone.

206
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,150
It's been passed

207
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,270
through different hands
for thousands of years.

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,450
Seventy years ago,
it came into the possession of Guilao,

209
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,200
- I want to cut open Xuantian Zibing!
- yet no one dared to cut it.

210
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,040
I want to cut open Xuantian Zibing!

211
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,910
(Life)
Then Guilao set up an underground auction.

212
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,870
(Death)
Only the winner of the Gumie Public Auction

213
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,550
can receive an invitation to the Death Game.

214
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,630
And only those who win the Death Game

215
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,920
are allowed to lay eyes
on Xuantian Zibing.

216
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,910
Has anyone ever

217
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,510
won this Death Game?

218
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,500
Yes.

219
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,350
Who?

220
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,000
In the last fifty years,

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,150
only three people

222
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,030
have won.

223
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,440
The most recent winner

224
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,530
was your grandfather,

225
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,410
