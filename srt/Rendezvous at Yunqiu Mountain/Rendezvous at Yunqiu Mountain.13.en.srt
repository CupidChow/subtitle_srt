1
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,520
You look so happy today.

2
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
Is something wrong?

3
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,759
You want to know?

4
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
That's a bad move. It's not a bad move.

5
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,720
Now,

6
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,600
Scumbag and green tea were caught off guard.

7
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,800
It's enough for them.

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,620
They want to create conflicts between them.

9
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
Let them bite each other.

10
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,860
Look who’s here. Look.

11
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,000
Little Ping’an.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Pretty lady.

13
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,000
Come here.

14
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,160
Let me introduce.

15
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,280
This is Aunt Lin Jing.

16
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,120
Hello, Pretty Aunt.

17
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,280
Hello. Hello.

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
That's Momo.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,120
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

20
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,920
Hi, Ping’an.

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Such a sweet mouth.

22
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,560
This is my new wine.

23
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,120
It tastes very special.

24
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Try it.

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,000
How is it?

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
It's really you.

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,120
Danning is thick and full.

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,610
The fragrance is strong and not sweet.

29
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,400
The taste is just right.

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,920
I can't say so many classy words.

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,360
Anyway, it's delicious.

32
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,880
It'll sell really well.

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,000
Our new wine

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,120
will get better.

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,520
Cheers.

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
Cheers. Cheers.

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
Here are the skewers.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,520
Try it.

39
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,800
This is too much.

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,520
Let me tell you.

41
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
This is just appetizer.

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,880
The hard dish is behind.

43
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Indeed.

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
This is just appetizer.

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,680
There's something more exciting.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
You think you can treat me to hotpot?

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,320
No, you have to make it up to me.

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,280
You asked me to work overtime on the weekend.

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I said I didn't.

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
You dare not admit it, right?

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,920
Are you a man or not?

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,800
I don't care.

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,680
You have to release blood.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Buy me clothes and jewelry.

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,040
Director Jin.

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,120
Happy birthday.

57
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,360
If you're free tonight,

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,079
why don't we get together?

59
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,080
I have a surprise for you.

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,560
What did you say?

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,280
You...

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,880
Okay.

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,760
Lin Jing has been investigating me lately.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,480
Can we not meet?

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,680
Let's not meet first.

66
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,360
I have something to do.

67
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,320
I have to go now.

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,159
Hey.

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Hello.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,530
Happy birthday, Director Jin.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,480
Xiao Meng, you look

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
beautiful today.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,920
Come in.

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,920
Let's have a good night tonight.

75
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
What do you think?

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,680
Not bad.

77
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,120
Sit.

78
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Xiao Meng,

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,360
To be honest,

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,880
I didn't expect

81
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,160
that I could

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,000
in my life.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
It's worth it.

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,080
Director Jin.

85
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
There's still a long way to go.

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,800
Good days for us

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,880
Cheers.

88
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
By the way, Xiao Meng,

89
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,160
how did you know it was my birthday?

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,080
I actually have a heart.

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,080
I know everything.

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,920
I searched Mr. Jin's information.

93
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,960
Xiao Meng,

94
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,460
I'm not afraid you'll laugh at me.

95
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
My wife.

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,360
My lover.

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,560
All the women around me

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,520
remember my birthday.

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
It has to be my Xiao Meng.

100
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,560
Actually,

101
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,560
I have a special gift

102
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
a special gift for you.

103
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,640
And a gift.

104
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,450
Don't worry, Director Jin.

105
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,200
Let me do some safety measures.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Give me a few minutes.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,760
Okay.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,080
Go ahead.

109
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
I'm going in.

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I'll wait for you inside.

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,960
Hurry up.

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,890
Don't make me wait too long.

113
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,280
Xiao Meng, I'm coming.

114
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,960
Xiao Meng, say something.

115
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,179
I'll watch if you don't say anything.

116
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,760
I did.

117
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,290
Sorry, my hands are trembling.

118
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,800
Well...

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,360
I...

120
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
The wine just spilled on me

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,130
and spilled it on me.

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,680
I'll put it in the room.

123
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
I'll say it.

124
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
I'll say it.

125
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,120
Put it in the room and I'll hold it.

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,760
I'll wash it later.

127
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
Sorry, Director Jin.

128
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,920
We wanted to give you a surprise.

129
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,440
but

130
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,000
you gave us a surprise.

131
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
I remember

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
everyone here today.

133
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,560
Thank you.

134
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,880
If anyone of you tell anyone about this,

135
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,800
I won't let you off!

136
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,320
I won't let you off!

137
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,160
Su Xiaomeng!

138
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,680
Xiao Meng, are you okay?

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
Did Director Jin bully you?

140
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Luckily, we're all here.

141
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,760
What else can you do?

142
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,160
I didn't expect Director Jin to be such a person.

143
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
I knew it.

144
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,480
I just made an appointment with Mr. Jin

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
as promised.

146
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,020
I didn't expect that he had a plot against me.

147
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
Everyone is here today.

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,000
If Director Jin makes things difficult for me,

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,880
you have to testify for me.

150
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
Xiao Meng, don't worry.

151
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,120
If he dares to bully you again,

152
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,400
I'll tell Mr. Lin.

153
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,200
we are all your backup.

154
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
That's you.

155
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,360
Jin Qiang must be ashamed in the company.

156
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,920
He's so majestic.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
I know who he is.

158
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,520
Everything is going according to plan.

159
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,480
Amazing.

160
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,160
This video is really interesting.

161
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,520
I think rabbits don't eat grass by their nest.

162
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,740
Director Jin and Du Li Li don't know each other well.

163
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,800
Now they're targeting Mr Lin's new secretary.

164
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,880
He's so shameless.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,560
Yes.

166
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,880
He doesn't care about Mr. Lin at all.

167
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,960
If this video is uploaded online,

168
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,020
Mr. Jin will be popular in the circle.

169
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Do I look good?

170
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Let me tell you.

171
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,560
If anyone dares to gossip behind my back again,

172
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
will get lost.

173
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,880
Sorry, Director Jin.

174
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,080
I'll delete it right away.

175
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,360
Mr. Jin, this video is all over the company.

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
It's useless to cover it up.

177
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,920
You can fire us all.

178
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,680
Who do you think you are?

179
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
How dare you talk to me like that?

180
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,400
You immediately

181
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
pack up and get lost.

182
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,040
Mr. Han.

183
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,760
Please judge for me.

184
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,400
I did my job.

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,760
I didn't violate any employee rules.

186
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,600
Why did Director Jin fire me?

187
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
I know.

188
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,760
Director Jin,

189
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
Due to your personal style,

190
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,760
because of your personal style.

191
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,090
You still don't repent.

192
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,880
You skipped the program and fired your employee.
