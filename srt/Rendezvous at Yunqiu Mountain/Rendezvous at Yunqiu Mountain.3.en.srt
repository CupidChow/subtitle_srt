1
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,120
I switched bodies with Mr. Lin.

2
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,580
They must think I'm crazy.

3
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,840
Before I find Mr. Lin,

4
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,300
I'd better play the role of Mr. Lin first.

5
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,639
A top student studying abroad.

6
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,400
A rich family enterprise.

7
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,480
I can speak English and French languages.

8
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,520
No, I can't do it.

9
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,920
We'll be exposed soon.

10
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,880
I have to find Mr. Lin.

11
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
Mr. Lin, this is the new product research plan

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,460
of the marketing department.

13
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,960
The marketing director said

14
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,240
with the product research department

15
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,520
with the product research department.

16
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,880
It has increased its sharpness.

17
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,940
Please have a look.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,940
What kind of industry is that?

19
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,880
I don't understand a word.

20
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,200
If there's no problem,

21
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
please sign the payment.

22
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,040
Mr. Lin.

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,079
How much is it?

24
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,800
Three million.

25
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,240
I think this plan can be more perfect.

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,840
Ask them to change it.

27
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,800
Mr. Lin, what's the problem?

28
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,400
What do you think?

29
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,079
They should know

30
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,480
Do I need to tell them?

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,740
Okay, I'll ask them to work overtime and do it again.

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,400
Luckily, I was quick.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,810
The leaders are good at asking questions.

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,440
It really works.

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,720
Oh my god.

36
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,280
Let's go.

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't always ride here next time.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,520
You're annoying.

39
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
You ride down.

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
You're annoying.

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
Aren't you going to ask me where I'm going?

42
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
Honey, I mean

43
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,900
no matter where you go,

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
my heart is with you.

45
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,400
Did you order someone to attack me?

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
If I die,

47
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Jin Qiang can inherit Ono Group.

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,480
Ono is my dad's work.

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,920
I won't let that happen.

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,040
Hello, beauty.

51
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,680
What's wrong with you?

52
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
Did someone bully you?

53
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
It's okay. You can tell me.

54
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
I'm not a bad person.

55
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,640
Look.

56
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,760
Take it.

57
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,740
I didn't expect you to have two faces in front of outsiders.

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
My husband cheated on me.

59
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
What should I do?

60
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,480
You're married.

61
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,320
Listen.

62
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,880
There are so many men

63
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,080
are too many.

64
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,040
If you cry for this,

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,440
That's not worth it.

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,600
If a woman

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,460
really want to keep a man's heart,

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
you can't be too serious.

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
Otherwise, men will think he's bound.

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
It's no fun.

71
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,200
You're right.

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,080
I should be cruel to him.

73
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,440
Yes.

74
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,640
What's wrong?

75
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,280
What's wrong?

76
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Nothing.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Lean on me.

78
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,240
Lean on me

79
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,040
My husband.

80
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,720
I wish he could be like you.

81
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,880
It's okay.

82
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,480
I'll take care of you. Okay.

83
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Oh.

84
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
There's a bug. There's a bug.

85
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Okay.

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Okay.

87
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,480
It's okay. Come on.

88
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,000
Didn't you say

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
women shouldn't be too serious.

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,320
Jin Qiang.

91
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
Lili.

92
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,520
My body can take it.

93
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,120
A dog can't change its fate.

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,720
It's not Lili.

95
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,680
Let me explain.

96
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,600
She just...

97
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,280
Lili.

98
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,200
Xiaotao, how did you fill this form?

99
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,080
It's a mess.

100
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,240
Sorry, Director Zhou.

101
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,120
It's okay.

102
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,970
Let me tell you how to change it.

103
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,800
Look at this.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,200
If I stop Director Zhou rashly,

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
will he take revenge on me?

106
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,680
Like this.

107
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
Look forward.

108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,850
Don't hesitate.

109
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,460
This kind of person needs to be punished.

110
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,800
You are me.

111
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
You are Mr. Lin.

112
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Lower your voice.

113
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,380
Since you're standing on my face,

114
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,810
you have the right to be the president.

115
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,800
Really?

116
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,640
Just change it like this.

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,300
Let go of your salty pig hands.

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,040
Mr. Lin.

119
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
We're just discussing

120
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,640
about work.

121
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,720
I don't mean anything else.

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,880
You can ask Tao if you don't believe me.

123
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,140
What do you think, Tao?

124
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
If you ask her to answer,

125
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
because you're the superior.

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,280
because you are the superior.

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,010
Su Xiaomeng.

128
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,080
Who are you to lecture me here?

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,040
She's not qualified.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
What about me?

131
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,320
From tomorrow onwards,

132
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,850
you don't have to work here.

133
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,240
Mr. Lin, I'm a senior here.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,640
You treat me like this

135
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,720
just because of this girl?

136
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Aren't you afraid of hurting your senior employee?

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,320
Compared to people like you who sexually harass female employees,

138
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
to taint a female employee like you.

139
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,929
I'd rather lose an old employee

140
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,640
to talk to the HR about my resignation.

141
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,720
If you leave here,

142
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,440
if you leave here,

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,840
I'll upload the CCTV online right now.

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,850
Aren't you leaving?

145
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,120
You just...

146
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,720
just now.

147
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,100
Thank you, Mr. Lin. Thank you.

148
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,280
Xiao Meng.

149
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,280
Xiao Meng.

150
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,200
This is the boss of our scenic area, Mr. Lin.

151
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
How could you talk to her like that?

152
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
I know.

153
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
I have something to discuss with Su.

154
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,540
I have something to discuss with Mr. Lin.

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,520
Mr. Lin, you're finally here.

156
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
I was so scared.

157
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,280
Su Xiaomeng.

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,040
I want you to give me back my body now.

159
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,720
I want to switch back with you.

160
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,520
But I don't know what to do.

161
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Honey.

162
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,280
You're back.

163
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,920
Tell me.

164
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
I'll pick you up.

165
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Good.

166
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,800
take this opportunity

167
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,280
to introduce myself.

168
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
I am Mr. Lin's husband,

169
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,360
the vice president of Ono Group.

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Jin Qiang.

171
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm sorry, Director Jin.

172
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,880
I need to talk to Mr. Lin.

173
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,320
Please step aside.

174
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Hey!

175
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
Where are you taking my wife?

176
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,380
None of your business.

177
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,210
Let's go.

178
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,400
I have other things to do.

179
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't get in my way.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,720
Not you, honey.

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
Where are you going?

182
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,400
What's going on?

183
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,880
Why are you in my body?

184
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,680
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
I don't know.

186
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,800
I came out of the ice cave.

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,930
I couldn't find you.

188
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,200
That's what happened.

189
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
Forget it. It's not your problem.

190
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,840
I shouldn't have gotten mad at you.

191
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,200
It's okay.

192
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,400
I think we met

193
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,920
like in the movie.

194
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,280
Soul switching.

195
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
That's not the point.

196
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
The point is we have to switch back.

197
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,840
But what should we do?

198
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,400
I remember we were in the ice cave.

199
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,680
we were drunk.

200
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,970
Make a wish to the acupuncture needle.

201
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,280
Then there was fog.

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,480
We switched bodies at that time.

203
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,720
We can't just wait.

204
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
The one who started it should be the one who started it.

205
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,600
Let's go to Dingdong

206
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,640
to see if we can switch back.

207
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,320
Slow down.

208
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,080
Where is she?

209
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
I finally found you.

210
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
Come with me.

211
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,200
Who are they?

212
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,840
We...

213
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,040
He's your dad.

214
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,460
He is your brother.

215
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm your mother.

216
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Yes.

217
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,080
Are you playing dumb with me?

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,120
She's my mom.

219
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,800
I'm busy today.

220
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,800
I don't have time to talk to you.

221
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
What do you mean?

222
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,280
Let's go home.

223
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,880
What are you doing?

224
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,200
Let me tell you something good.

225
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,440
We have arranged a marriage for you.

226
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,520
The betrothal gifts are settled.

227
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,800
We'll get engaged tomorrow.

228
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,460
From now on,

229
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,880
just stay home and enjoy yourself.

230
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
You don't have to be a waitress anymore.

231
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,440
Arrange a wedding.

232
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,850
You know about this?

233
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,240
I just knew.

234
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,120
After all this,

235
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
Are you going to get married?

236
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,880
Is this a feudal society?

237
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,000
Still playing this trick?

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
So what?

239
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,520
If you don't get married,

240
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,720
what about your brother's betrothal gift?

241
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,880
Let's go home.

242
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,040
Honey.

243
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
Su Xiaomeng

244
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,400
How dare you push your mom?

245
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,840
I hate people

246
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,500
who value men more than women.

247
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,440
Don't stop me. If you stop me,

248
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,200
Don't blame me for being rude.
