1
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,560
Let's check again.

2
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,680
See if there's any other way.

3
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Drink more.

4
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,290
If we drink too much,

5
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
we might switch back.

6
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,280
Copy that.

7
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,579
[Mr. Lin, you're here.] Okay.

8
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,640
I envy you. You're rich.

9
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,320
You're rich.

10
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,840
We're about the same age.

11
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Why are we so different?

12
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Look at you.

13
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,920
It's worth over 100 million yuan.

14
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,040
What brand do you want?

15
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,079
What kind of luxury meal do you want

16
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,360
You can go anywhere you want.

17
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,240
What about me?

18
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,480
I don't have a car, a house or savings.

19
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,720
I only lose my job at any time.

20
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,720
And my parents keep asking me for money.

21
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,680
I don't deserve to be envious.

22
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,920
You are Mr. Lin.

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,360
What worries do you have?

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
In my position,

25
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,520
If I make a wrong decision,

26
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
At least,

27
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
we'll lose hundreds of millions.

28
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,480
or hundreds of millions.

29
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,079
So I can't make any mistakes.

30
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,760
My dad passed away

31
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,040
due to a heart attack.

32
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,920
My competitor is eyeing Ono.

33
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,220
I support the company with all kinds of controversies.

34
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,240
But I have to bear all of this.

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,000
I have to hold on.

36
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,079
Now I'm surrounded by enemies.

37
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
If it's serious,

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,080
the shareholders will impeach him and kick him out of Oz.

39
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,040
I didn't expect you to have so many troubles.

40
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,440
I'll play a round.

41
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,120
Cheers.

42
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Cheers.

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,480
Wake up, it's dawn.

44
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,080
Xiao Meng.

45
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
Get me a glass of water.

46
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,080
Mr. Lin, how are you?

47
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,120
I just have a headache. I'm fine.

48
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,680
Mr. Lin.

49
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,880
Good morning, Zi Ming.

50
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
Have a seat.

51
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,560
I have an urgent contract.

52
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,700
Please have a look.

53
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,810
The quotation is obviously a trap.

54
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,640
I can see

55
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,240
such a contract.

56
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,560
let alone Mr. Lin.

57
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
Right, Mr. Lin?

58
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Yes.

59
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,360
So this contract

60
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,760
sign the contract.

61
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,560
Okay.

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,159
You are so good at reading contracts.

63
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
I guess you have a special identity.

64
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm just a waitress in the hotel.

65
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,920
I learned it from Mr. Lin.

66
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,080
Yes.

67
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,700
Let's go. Let's go.

68
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,700
By the way, Mr. Lin,

69
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
I've checked what you want to investigate.

70
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
He's very cunning.

71
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,560
He avoided all the surveillance cameras.

72
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
Why don't we look for the official channel?

73
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,840
Ono Group is unstable inside.

74
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
We can't alert them.

75
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,160
She's right.

76
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,040
Look at what she said. It's good.

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
Mr. Han, I want you

78
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,880
hire a professional security team

79
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
to keep Mr. Lin safe.

80
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
Okay, I'll arrange it now.

81
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,240
What's your plan next?

82
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,240
I'll listen to you.

83
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
I think

84
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,680
since we can't switch back temporarily,

85
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,880
we can only accept the fact that we switch our identities.

86
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
What do you mean?

87
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,080
You mean you'll be my waiter?

88
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,810
You'll be the heir of Ono Group for the time being.

89
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,820
I have to take care of everything in the company.

90
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,080
Take my jewelry with you.

91
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,160
Take this bank card.

92
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,080
100,000 won a month should be enough.

93
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,680
I can't spend that much.

94
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
And you gave me the card.

95
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
what will you do?

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,440
My salary is definitely not enough for your expenses.

97
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,360
I can't take it.

98
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,080
Take it.

99
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
Treat me a meal in the company.

100
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
You need to pay for everything.

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
As for me, don't worry.

102
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,809
Since you choose to be an ordinary person,

103
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,360
you have to adapt to the lifestyle of ordinary people.

104
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,410
Help me deal with Jin Qiang.

105
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,560
I can't do this.

106
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,650
Don't worry.

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
I'll take care of your business.

108
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
What do you mean?

109
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,720
Hello, mom.

110
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,400
I'll discuss it with you later.

111
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,930
about the betrothal gifts.

112
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,080
You brat.

113
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,850
How dare you come back to see us?

114
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,290
You really don't want to live here.

115
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,480
Dad, mom, I was rude that day

116
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,480
because I was cheated by a scumbag.

117
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,560
You still have your savings?

118
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,760
Mr. Lin sent me two years of year-end bonus.

119
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,440
It's 200,000 in total.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
200,000 won.

121
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,240
That's him.

122
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,360
His name is Jin Qiang.

123
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,320
I dated him for a while.

124
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,080
but he cheated on me.

125
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,840
A woman named Du Li Li.

126
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
They colluded

127
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,320
to buy Xiao Dong a car.

128
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Scumbag, you've gone too far!

129
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,720
Daughter, don't worry.

130
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,920
We will get the money back.

131
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,840
Tell me the address.

132
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,920
We'll try our best to get it back for you.

133
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Thank you, dad.

134
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,280
We'll try our best to get it back for you.

135
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,360
In the future,

136
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
in the future.

137
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,760
We are your parents.

138
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Will we make things difficult for you?

139
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
Will we hurt you?

140
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,560
Yes, we're family.

141
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,080
Got it, mom.

142
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,080
Let's go back and discuss it.

143
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Let's discuss

144
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,720
how to get the money here.

145
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,360
Let's go.

146
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
Ono Group.

147
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,360
Is there a sensible one?

148
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,480
Your Director Jin Qiang

149
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,640
and your mistress, Du Li Li,

150
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,760
with your mistress.

151
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
and bullied us.

152
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,840
and extort our daughter's money.

153
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Shameless.

154
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
Someone is sensible.

155
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,280
and read it online.

156
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,920
Who dares to spread rumours here?

157
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,880
It's her!

158
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
You're that vixen.

159
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,280
Du Li Li, right?

160
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,040
It's her.

161
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,920
Pay me back!

162
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
What money?

163
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,280
Are you crazy?

164
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,440
Little fox.

165
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,080
How dare you hit my wife?

166
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,840
Honey!

167
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
How dare you hit me?

168
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
What are you doing if you move again?

169
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,920
What are you doing?

170
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,040
What do you think?

171
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,720
This is Jin Qiang.

172
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
That scumbag.

173
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Mr. Jin, you are Mr. Jin?

174
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,160
We're here for money.

175
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,360
Pay us back!

176
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,720
Don't move!

177
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,280
Don't move.

178
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,720
What's wrong?

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,520
Are you crazy?

180
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,560
You saw it.

181
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,280
It's easy to bully old people, right?

182
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,120
Come on.

183
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
Hit me.

184
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,520
I didn't touch you.

185
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,280
I didn't touch him.

186
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,160
Come on, I didn't touch you.

187
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,220
What are you doing?

188
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,840
Jin Qiang hit me!

189
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,880
I have a heart attack.

190
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,200
Du Li Li Jin Qiang hit me!

191
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,560
The mistress hit me. (Help!)

192
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,480
Are you extorting me?

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
Are you trying to blackmail me?

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
Honey, call the police.

195
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,280
Security! Security!

196
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
Where is the security?

197
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,160
He hit me.

198
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,760
Can't you see? Are you blind?

199
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,730
Call the police!

200
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,360
Take him away!

201
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,440
Call the police, honey.

202
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,120
Are you okay?

203
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,360
Stop it.

204
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,090
Which department are you from?

205
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,760
Did my face get broken?

206
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,400
Are they crazy?

207
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
They hit us for no reason.

208
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,720
They just called you a mistress.

209
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,720
Did Lin Jing send you?

210
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,920
Lin Jing knows about us.

211
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,720
I think the one who isn't loved is the mistress.

212
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,120
Besides, how did she know?

213
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,420
That female waitress.

214
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,080
It must be the waitress who told Lin Jing.

215
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,210
It's all your fault.

216
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,640
If you hadn't seduced her,

217
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,570
why would he tell on you, Jin Qiang?

218
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,680
Listen.

219
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,720
If this is exposed,

220
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,280
we'll be sued.

221
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,960
Don't worry.

222
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,160
I won't let this happen.

223
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,360
What are you doing?

224
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,240
I'm done.

225
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
Mr. Jin.

226
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,000
Miss Du.

227
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,560
It’s all a misunderstanding.

228
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:55,960
Yes.

229
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,520
Miss Jin.

230
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,720
We didn't recognize you.

231
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,680
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,240
It was my daughter

233
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,040
my daughter ordered us to do this.

234
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,960
Who is your daughter?
