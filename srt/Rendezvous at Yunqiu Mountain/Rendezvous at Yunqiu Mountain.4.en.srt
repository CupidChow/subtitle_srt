1
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,039
Don't stop me. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

2
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,600
if you stop me.

3
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,440
Su Xiaomeng.

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,320
How dare you?

5
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,440
Su, how could you hit him?

6
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
We have to convince him, Mr. Lin.

7
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,560
Mr. Lin.

8
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,720
What do you mean by reasoning?

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,760
I need to teach her a lesson.

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,080
Mr. Lin.

11
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,410
She's so unreasonable.

12
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,360
How dare you hit your dad?

13
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
Xiao Dong, are you crazy?

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,840
Is your sister crazy?

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,960
Take her home.

16
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Su Xiaomeng.

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,240
Looks like

18
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,920
teach you a lesson today.

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,250
I'll teach you a lesson.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,840
Su Xiaomeng!

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
How dare you hit my dad?

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,240
Are you crazy? My parents deserve to support you.

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,360
I'll kill you today!

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,800
Xiao Dong!

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
My son.

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,840
My tooth dropped.

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
Mom.

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Aunt, stop it.

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,800
Stop it.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,200
Who are you?

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,040
Who are you?

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,600
Me.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm Lin Jing, president of Ono Group.

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,600
Are you her boss?

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,160
Yes.

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
Go back safely.

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
and teach your employees.

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,640
Yes.

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,520
She is so rude. How dare she hit his dad?

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,160
Su Xiaomeng is my good friend.

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,600
Don't bully her.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,930
We'll bully her.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,600
Stop!

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,440
Su Xiaomeng, stop!

45
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,640
No wonder she is so stubborn.

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,520
She has a backer, right?

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,360
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

49
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,840
I apologize on their behalf.

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,600
You're their daughter.

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
How could they do this to you?

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,360
Actually, they are my adoptive parents.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,120
My biological parents passed away early.

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,200
My parents adopted me.

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,480
I raised you.

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,520
because I raised you?

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
After all, they raised me.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,440
I need to help my brother.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,840
But they've gone too far lately.

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,320
I'm really sorry.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
Don't say sorry.

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,440
There's nothing we can do about this family.

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
When we switch back,

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,040
go to Ono Group with me.

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,500
I'll arrange a job for you.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,520
Get rid of this kind of family.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm leaving.

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,560
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,440
It's the one in front.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,480
Look at your right pocket.

71
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,720
in your right pocket.

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
Do you?

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Go and drive.

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,380
I don't know how to drive, Mr. Lin.

75
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,920
Forget it. I'll do it.

76
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
Are you carsick?

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm fine, Mr Lin.

78
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
You're driving too much.

79
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,380
I haven't driven for too long.

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,400
As the president of a listed company, I drive for you.

81
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Just be content.

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,300
Let's make a wish to the acupuncture needle.

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,440
and turn back.

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,200
Okay.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,680
Hello, Needle.

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,880
Let's put an end to this farce.

87
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Please.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,320
Hello, Dingdong Holy Needle.

89
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,680
Please let me switch back with Mr. Lin.

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
Please. Please.

91
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,040
Mr. Lin seems useless.

92
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
I don't think we can switch back.

93
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,720
What's the problem?

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
Is it because we are not devout enough?

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,560
How can it be reverence?

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,200
Let's kneel and try.

97
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
It's useless, Mr. Lin.

98
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,200
It seems that making a wish is useless.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,660
There must be another way.

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,040
All right, let's go out first.

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
It's too cold here.

102
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,840
Don't freeze to death before you change your soul.

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,320
Let's go.

104
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,360
Thank you, Mr Lin.

105
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,600
That's weird.

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,120
The ice pillar suddenly glows.

107
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,650
It's fogging for no reason.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,770
There must be something wrong.

109
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,800
What should we do now?

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,159
I'm going home to look up some information.

111
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,960
We might find something useful.

112
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,159
Come with me.

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,159
No, if I don't go back to the guesthouse...

114
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,840
No.

115
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,960
If you don't go back to the guesthouse, you'll be considered absent.

116
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
I...

117
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,360
You're the president of Ono Group.

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,460
It's easy to give the waiter a day off.

119
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,440
Yes.

120
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,440
This is my assistant.

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,360
Call him.

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,220
and ask him to arrange a vacation.

123
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,380
Hello, Mr. Lin.

124
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,520
Hello, Han Ziming?

125
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
I have a favor to ask you.

126
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
Mr. Lin, what happened?

127
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,020
Why do you sound like that?

128
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,920
Be serious.

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,840
Mr. Han, I want you to go to the guesthouse

130
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,200
to find a employee named Su Xiaomeng

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,680
and give her five days off.

132
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,400
And...

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
20 minutes.

134
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,040
Come pick me up in the ice cave in 20 minutes.

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
Okay, Mr Lin.

136
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,840
Thank you.

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,200
Mr. Lin, aren't you cold?

138
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
Mr. Lin.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,560
What took you so long?

140
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,490
Don't you know my time is precious?

141
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,640
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

142
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,920
There was a traffic jam.

143
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,040
It's okay.

144
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,760
Have you arranged the vacation?

145
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Yes.

146
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,690
Don't worry, Mr Lin.

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,520
This is...

148
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,600
She is Su Xiaomeng.

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
She's my friend.

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,400
I invited her to my house.

151
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,920
Hello, Miss Su.

152
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,840
Cut the crap.

153
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Let's go.

154
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Just listen to her.

155
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,520
Mr. Lin, don't you know how to drive?

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
Why did you ask him to pick you up?

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
Haven't you vomited enough?

158
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,289
Enough. Enough.

159
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,640
Do you have coffee in the car?

160
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,000
I think I finished it two days ago.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
I forgot to prepare.

162
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,040
Mr. Lin, if you want coffee,

163
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,520
I'll buy you a cup.

164
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,840
No, I don't want it.

165
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
I'll drink it.

166
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,600
or not?

167
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,780
Then I won't drink.

168
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
No.

169
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,320
By the way, Mr. Lin,

170
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,760
Mr. Wang of Haihe Group

171
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
invited you for lunch tomorrow.

172
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
Are you going?

173
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,400
No. Mr. Wang likes smoking and drinking.

174
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,720
Mr. Lin hates the smell of cigarettes on him.

175
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
If you want to sign the contract,

176
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,330
just send it to the company.

177
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,160
Mr. Lin,

178
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
If you have any problem,

179
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,620
you can tell me in private.

180
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,840
Miss Su,

181
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,200
I don't need you

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,720
for our company.

183
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,320
It's okay, Ziming.

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
From now on,

185
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,360
will listen to Su Xiaomeng.

186
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
She represents me.

187
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,560
Don't disobey her.

188
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,930
Okay.

189
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,160
By the way, Mr. Han,

190
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,720
when I was in the hot spring with Mr. Lin,

191
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,440
I was attacked by a masked man.

192
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,000
He killed him.

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,440
Luckily, I ran away with Mr. Lin.

194
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,720
Really?

195
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
Look into it.

196
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,560
We don't know who's behind this yet.

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,800
But you have to keep a low profile.

198
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't alert them.

199
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Okay.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,560
Why does Miss Su

201
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
sounds like Mr. Lin.

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
Your house is so big.

203
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,920
Mr. Lin, you brought a guest back.

204
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,850
What should we prepare for dinner?

205
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,200
Two cakes from the theatre

206
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,400
Two Dagiryeong black tea

207
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
No sugar.

208
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
She has the same taste as me.

209
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,420
Prepare like this.

210
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Yes.

211
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
There it is.

212
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,400
The location of the ice cave is special.

213
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
Especially the location of the big ice pillar.

214
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,320
Is it really because of the change in the magnetic field

215
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,360
caused us to switch bodies?

216
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,240
That's impossible.

217
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,370
My ancestors lived in Yunqiu Mountain for generations.

218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,040
So many people visit the ice cave every year.

219
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
Why are we the only ones?

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,400
There was a eclipse at 12.

221
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,000
Isn't that when we were frozen?

222
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,280
Could it be...

223
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,640
our body switch is related to eclipse?

224
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,360
It's possible.

225
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,000
When the eclipse occurred,

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,930
the earth magnetic field changed.

227
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,400
Maybe these two are really related.

228
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,800
You mean

229
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,200
we have to wait for the next eclipse

230
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,530
We have to wait for the next solar eclipse.

231
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,440
The next solar eclipse

232
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,840
Half a year later.

233
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,000
No way.

234
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,240
Let's check

235
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,360
See if there's any other way.

236
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,240
So many.

237
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,640
Which one should we start?

238
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,400
We'll do our best.

239
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Try them one by one.

240
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,530
What if it works?

241
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
Okay.

242
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,560
Actor table.
