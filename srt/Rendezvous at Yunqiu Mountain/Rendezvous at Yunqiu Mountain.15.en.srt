1
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,640
What do you think? What do you mean?

2
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,120
can we switch back

3
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,040
can we really switch back?

4
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,080
I think so.

5
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,320
Anyway,

6
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,640
I learned a lot

7
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,120
in Mr. Lin's position.

8
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,440
I finally understand

9
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,680
That's what you're saying.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
In this position,

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,280
What does that mean?

12
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,960
Actually I learned a lot

13
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
I feel much better.

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,440
Really.

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,360
Some things

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,240
are not as important as I thought.

17
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,360
I don't have to

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,920
on myself.

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,560
I used to

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
I always dreamed

21
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,840
become a rich man.

22
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,210
But this time, I really became Mr. Lin.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,320
I found that

24
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,960
the life of rich people

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,520
is not as good as I thought.

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,960
I have all kinds of worries.

27
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,680
I told you.

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,520
But thanks to this experience,

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
I have the courage to fight back.

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,079
I thought

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,400
I could never get rid of

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
the constraints of my original family.

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,920
But I'm different now.

34
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,080
I, Su Xiaomeng,

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
will fight back

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
and grasp your own life.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
I know.

38
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
I believe you can do it.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,880
Tell me.

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Is this the true desire

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,120
in our hearts?

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,480
Maybe.

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
Let's toast

44
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,160
for our real desire.

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,120
Cheers.

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,520
This time, I finally solved a big problem.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
You're amazing.

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,560
You contributed a lot too.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,560
But as far as I know Jin Qiang,

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
he won't let it go.

51
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
We have to be careful.

52
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
What are you going to do?

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,360
Just wait and see.

54
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
I'll go home and rest for a while.

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,320
What about the company?

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,660
you have proved with your ability

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,560
you can be Mr. Lin.

58
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,320
Dad, I miss Pretty Lady.

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,480
When will she come back?

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,360
I don't know.

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,880
Can't you just call

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,960
to care about her?

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Pretty lady might be busy.

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
I don't know

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,560
if I'll disturb her.

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,280
I think you and beautiful lady are a good match.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
What do you think, Dad?

68
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,920
What do you know?

69
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,440
Surprise.

70
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,120
Pretty lady.

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,720
Xiaoping.

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,050
Are you done with your work?

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,520
It's over for now.

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,120
I'm back to rest for a few days.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
Take some more rest.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,850
If you keep working,

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,720
You'll miss a lot of good things in life.

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
That's right.

79
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,320
If there is good wine,

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,320
I can consider it.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,360
How do you know?

82
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,760
I have some new products for you to try.

83
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,320
Probably.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,320
We share the same feelings.

85
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
She's gone with that man.

86
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,280
I'll go up from here.

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,010
That's enough. There's a door.

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,880
I’m not his mom.

89
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,760
Xiao Meng gave us money a few days ago.

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,960
Money is nothing.

91
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,680
She moved our son's computer

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
of our son's computer.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,320
You're so forgetful.

94
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,280
I didn't mean that.

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
What do you mean?

96
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,800
Our son is about to get married.

97
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
If we don't empty her,

98
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,880
what about our son?

99
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,680
Well...

100
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,560
What do you mean?

101
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,090
Let's get down to business.

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,440
I'll open the door.

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
See if there's anyone behind.

104
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,880
Who are you?

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,560
Kids, you scared me.

106
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm Su Xiaomeng's mother.

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,040
I brought her some food.

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,760
Is she here?

109
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,760
Come here.

110
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,360
She's cute.

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,240
Aunt Su told me that you treat her badly.

112
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,320
How could I give her something?

113
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,640
You heard it wrong.

114
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,420
How old are you?

115
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
7. Did you go to school?

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,560
Which grade did you go to?

117
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,440
Are you a freshman?

118
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,560
Did you steal?

119
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,600
No.

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,040
Catch the thief!

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,960
Catch the thief! Catch the thief!

122
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Let him go!

123
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,440
Come here.

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,480
Dad, beautiful lady.

125
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,360
They're stealing.

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,160
You trespassed.

127
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
How dare you touch my son!

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,610
Call the police.

129
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,370
Call the police.

130
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,640
Su Xiaomeng, let me tell you.

131
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,680
Are you crazy?

132
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,960
How can you do this to your parents?

133
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,760
Can a woman like you

134
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,560
get married?

135
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,520
Cut the crap.

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,760
People like you

137
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,480
will be caught by the police.

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,530
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

139
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,280
Stop!

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
Put it down.

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
Are you hurt?

142
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,120
Does it hurt?

143
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,640
No, beautiful lady.

144
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm not afraid of bad guys.

145
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,480
I want to protect you.

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,960
What a man.

147
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,880
It’s all my fault.

149
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,960
because of me.

150
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,240
It's not your fault.

151
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
You're a victim too.

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,520
It must be unfair for a girl

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,960
with such parents.

154
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,640
Actually,

155
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
they are my uncles and aunts.

156
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
I was adopted.

157
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,160
I see.

158
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,800
Even if you're adopted,

159
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,080
I can't exploit you like this.

160
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Pretty lady.

161
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
Don't blame yourself.

162
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,760
My dad is right.

163
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
It's not your fault.

164
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,010
Don't worry.

165
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,039
I will solve this problem as soon as possible.

166
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,080
I won't let them come again.

167
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,640
Why do you carry everything on your own?

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
You still have me.

169
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,940
From now on,

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,120
I'll protect you.

171
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,760
A bad woman like beautiful lady

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,480
doesn't deserve to be your family.

173
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,320
From now on, Dad and I will be your family.

174
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
We'll protect you together.

175
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
Say it.

176
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,960
Mr. Jin, I've got the information you asked me to investigate.

177
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,040
Su Xiaomeng is now

178
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,640
near Tarbo Ancient Village.

179
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,970
Her landlord is Lu Xiao.

180
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,120
She's a wine maker from Rong Zi Restaurant.

181
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
They are close.

182
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
Rong Zi Restaurant.

183
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,440
Let's go.

184
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,850
This is the wine cellar of Rong Zi Restaurant.

185
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,960
I'll let you drink as much as you want today.

186
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,560
If you're drunk,

187
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,810
I'll carry you back.

188
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,760
Humph!

189
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
You underestimate me.

190
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,560
I didn't expect it to be this big.

191
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,020
Different cellars have different years of wine

192
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,760
Come here

193
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,680
These are all wine of different breeds

194
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,840
with different kinds of wine. Try it.

195
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,160
Pick your favorite.

196
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I choose this one.

197
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,640
This is called soft peach wine.

198
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,440
It's made with red beads grapes.

199
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,840
It tastes fresh and elegant.

200
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,360
with strong fragrance of flowers and fruits.

201
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
I like them too.

202
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,480
These two are made of red-starred pearl grapes.

203
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,880
Why does it taste different?

204
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
You found out.

205
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,440
These two batches of rubber pots are different.

206
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
Different pots

207
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
will bring different taste.

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Which one do you think is better?

209
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,400
Can't we

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,960
into the same bucket?

211
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,160
It's not that I don't want to.

212
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,920
I just can't.

213
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,160
This one has low material rate.

214
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,240
It costs a lot.

215
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,680
It's just a small workshop.

216
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,880
for small workshops.

217
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
What a pity.

218
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,120
I want to promote

219
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,480
this batch of new products.

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
Your performance this year

221
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,880
is quite good.

222
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,760
We'll continue next year.

223
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,720
According to our market policy,

224
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,120
and catch the clients.

225
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,240
and continue.

226
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,080
Hello.

227
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,240
Is Su Xiaomeng here?

228
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,560
I don't know.

229
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,880
She is a wine maker here.

230
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,360
called Lu Lu Xiao.

231
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,820
He went to the wine cellar with a lady.

232
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,580
Over there.

233
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,440
That way.

234
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
OK. Thank you. Go on.

235
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,080
So next,
