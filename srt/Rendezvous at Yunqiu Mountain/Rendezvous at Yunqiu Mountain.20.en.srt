1
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
Go to Xiao Meng

2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Only she can handle everything.

3
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,639
Don't worry.

4
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,570
I won't let anything happen to you.

5
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,040
Secretary Su.

6
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,960
Mr. Lin was taken away by the audit department.

7
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,040
Ono needs you now.

8
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,960
I know.

9
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,020
I need you to arrange a few things.

10
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,880
First,

11
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,480
Let the PR department start an emergency plan.

12
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,240
Second,

13
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,160
the audit department

14
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,220
to sign a confidentiality agreement

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,360
to sign a confidentiality agreement.

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,640
and confiscated the phone.

17
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,000
Third, there's something wrong with the financial document.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,860
Inform the legal team to gather relevant evidence.

19
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm an orphan.

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,520
Mr. Lin's father.

21
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Mr. Lin's father

22
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
That's why

23
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,040
of the PR department.

24
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,000
was set by Chairman Lin

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
for his daughter.

26
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,080
It's not allowed unless it's urgent.

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Only Chairman Lin and I

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,680
know about this.

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
I am Lin Jing.

30
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
Now is the critical moment.

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I was right.

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,770
Although her appearance has changed,

33
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
her behavior habits

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,560
are engraved in her bones.

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,440
It won't change.

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,240
I can't explain so much now.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,440
Save Xiao Meng first.

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,560
She is innocent.

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,960
Okay, don't worry.

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm leaving.

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,480
You heard that?

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,840
Okay.

43
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,079
It's just that this is too strange.

46
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,640
No one will believe me.

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
No, I have to go to the office.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
You haven't eaten anything all day.

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,970
Drink this bowl of soup.

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,370
I'll go with you.

51
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,240
The flow of funds doesn't make sense.

52
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,760
I knew it.

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,760
These cameras are connected to the cloud.

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,460
I think we can find something.

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,280
No wonder Zhu helped Jin Qiang.

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
Jin Qiang is really stupid.

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
The cloud plate

58
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,780
with our company account.

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
This video

60
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
is enough to ruin their reputation.

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,760
Ono is my dad's work.

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,560
I won't let him

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,020
be ruined by these people.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Lin Jing,

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
how do you explain

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
The funds that flow overseas...

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,640
Hello, I have a few documents.

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,700
Please have a look.

69
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,159
Mr. Lin has nothing to do with the illegal investment.

70
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,720
It's Jin Qiang, Du Li Li.

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,840
by Jin Qiang, Du Li Li.

72
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,240
They not only embezzled illegal funds,

73
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
but also involved in prostitution.

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,700
Look at the screen.

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,600
Look. It's here. It's here.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,530
[Mr. Zhu, I'm sorry.] [I'm sorry.]

77
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
About your investigation,

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,840
Let's go back.

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,040
We need to check it again.

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,840
Thank you.

81
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Are you okay?

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,640
I knew you'd find a way.

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,080
I told you you're not alone.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm sorry I messed up again.

85
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
Why did you say that?

86
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,080
During this time,

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,840
everyone in Ono Group

88
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,640
admire you.

89
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
You did a lot.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
that I can't do.

91
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,040
After our efforts,

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,000
our town

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,680
will become

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,810
of the industry and cultural tourism.

95
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,960
We can't let Ono

96
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
in their hands.

97
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,280
We must work together to cope with this crisis.

98
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
There's another tough battle to fight.

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
You need to face it alone.

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,680
It's okay. I'm always here.

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
Recently,

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,880
about the Sand Town project.

103
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,520
is completely groundless.

104
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
We have submitted

105
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,120
to the relevant departments.

106
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,160
The future investment plan won't be affected.

107
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,880
The Sand Town

108
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,280
of Oz Town.

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,440
We promise

110
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,360
not only will we not reduce the investment,

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,080
but also increase the development.

112
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,159
and make it the benchmark of cultural tourism.

113
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,340
Please ask a question.

114
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,840
Mr. Lin.

115
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,600
When the tourism is out of season,

116
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,440
is there any problem

117
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,500
Is there a problem?

118
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Indeed.

119
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,200
Tourism industry will be affected by seasonal factors.

120
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
But the Sand Town

121
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,240
is not a short-term profit project.

122
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,960
Not only do we have a complete solution,

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
we will also make

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,400
in the next month.

125
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,690
Now it's the low season of tourism.

126
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,480
How capable is she

127
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
three times?

128
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,160
Let's just watch her make a fool of herself.

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,960
We will respond

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
with action.

131
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,880
Everyone.

132
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
This is the so-called

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,440
you mentioned before.

134
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,760
For a week,

135
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,840
the order of the Sand Town increased.

136
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,200
The tourists will be waiting for half a year.

137
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,240
Do you still think I'm dreaming?

138
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,840
This is just a short-term effect.

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
Short-term effect?

140
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,480
If you hadn't spread the rumor

141
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
and ruined the reputation of the group,

142
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,200
The profit of the Sand Town has doubled.

143
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,880
As for your crimes,

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
I have submitted the evidence

145
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,960
to the relevant department.

146
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,800
Mr. Lin, we misunderstood you.

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,840
It's our pleasure

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
to have a leader like you.

149
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
From now on,

150
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,640
I will take over Ono Group again.

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,280
For the sake of the Sand Town,

152
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,920
and to clear the group's name.

153
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,640
Thank you for your help.

154
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
No matter who you are,

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll stand by you without hesitation.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
on your side.

157
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go.

158
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,890
Midorio's crisis has been lifted.

159
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,480
The operation of the Sand Town is on track.

160
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,080
Why are you unhappy?

161
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,840
Although Sand Town was successfully promoted,

162
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
but also brought

163
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
in the industry.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,400
But we need to keep the lead in the industry.

165
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,300
we must have the advantage of differentiation.

166
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,560
The wine in Rong Zi Hotel has high quality.

167
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,040
The management of the chateau is also very professional.

168
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,440
We can cooperate with

169
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
with Ono Group.

170
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,560
and make a top wine brand.

171
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,080
Are you officially going to

172
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,480
with Rong Zi Restaurant?

173
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,640
Yes.

174
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
But she has to go.

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,530
Actually, you two want to go together.

176
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Just now,

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,360
Ms. Su sent me a message.

178
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,480
She said

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,880
convinced Mr. Lu of Rong Zi Hotel

180
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,040
to sign a strategic cooperation with us.

181
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Really?

182
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
That's great.

183
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,760
Mr. Lu is very interested

184
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,880
and Ono Group,

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,680
Any comment on this contract?

186
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,640
No.

187
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,240
I look forward to working with you.

188
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,680
Let's go. Let's go.
