1
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

2
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,580
for letting me enjoy the hot spring here.

3
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,120
But we can't

4
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,800
at work time.

5
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,760
It's okay.

6
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
I allow it.

7
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,960
It's part of your work.

8
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,400
I envy you.

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,280
You're carefree.

10
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
If possible,

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,460
I want to change it with you. Okay.

12
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,560
Mr. Lin.

13
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
Stop joking.

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,720
You're the only heir to Ono Group.

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
So many people envy you.

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,660
I'm jealous. Let's go.

17
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,480
I envy you.

19
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,880
You're carefree.

20
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,210
No worries. No worries.

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,530
It's not like me.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
such a big company.

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
in such a big company.

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,020
I can't make any mistakes.

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,960
Absolutely not.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Mr. Lin.

27
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,200
You are drunk.

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm not drunk.

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
One more.

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,160
Okay.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
Hello?

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
Help!

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,240
Help!

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Help!

35
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
Mr. Lin, go!

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Mr. Lin.

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
Let's hide in the ice cave.

38
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,680
Mr. Lin.

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,840
Don't worry.

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,200
I don't think he'll come after us.

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,200
This is an undeveloped area.

42
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
This is...

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,020
Where is it? It's here.

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,400
This is the ice cave of Yunqiu Mountain.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,180
Look at these ice pillars.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
It formed in the ice millions years ago.

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,279
Mr. Lin.

48
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,800
Look.

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,800
This ice pillar is called the Dingdong Holy Needle.

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,060
Legend has it that if you make a wish to it,

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
your wish will come true.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,060
Mr. Lin.

53
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,720
Make a wish.

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,280
Make a wish?

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Where is this?

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,280
What happened just now?

57
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Yeah.

58
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,570
What's going on?

59
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,020
There has never been fog in this ice cave.

60
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,530
Where is Mr. Lin?

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,880
Mr. Lin.

62
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,400
Mr. Lin.

63
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,000
Where did that employee go?
