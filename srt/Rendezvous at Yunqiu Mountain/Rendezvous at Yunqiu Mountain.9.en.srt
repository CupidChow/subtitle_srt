1
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,560
It's time to get off work.

2
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,320
Why is the R&D department still here?

3
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
That's the norm of Ono.

4
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,760
We all work overtime voluntarily.

5
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
What volunteer?

6
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,010
Do you think I've never worked?

7
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,320
Mr. Lin, have you ever worked?

8
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,250
It's none of your business.

9
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,640
Get up, everyone.

10
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
No need to work overtime.

11
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,360
You should rest after work.

12
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,620
You don't have to work overtime anymore.

13
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,400
Get up and go home to sleep.

14
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,680
Thank you, Mr Lin.

15
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
You're welcome.

16
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,640
Go back and have a good rest.

17
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
Bye.

18
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,760
Mr. Lin.

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,160
Is she the one I know?

20
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,400
Ms. Lin I know?

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
Yes.

22
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
She's suddenly changed lately.

23
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,280
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,200
What does the message

25
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,650
What do you mean?

26
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,280
I said I can't stay at your house recently.

27
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
Just what I said.

28
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,560
Jin Qiang.

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,329
You've changed.

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,360
Are you going to please Lin Jing?

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
Mr. Lin, have some water.

32
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,690
I'm not thirsty.

33
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,920
Lower your head.

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Come with me.

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
Jin Qiang.

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,880
You wanted to be close to me next door to Lin Jing.

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,280
You said it was exciting.

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,520
Now I can't even

39
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,760
your car, right?

40
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,640
It's close to your house.

41
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,770
Go back by yourself.

42
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,480
Walk back on your own.

43
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
Jin Qiang, you're two-timed.

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Are you a jerk?

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Stop it.

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
Go back by yourself.

47
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,480
Wait for me.

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,920
Xiao Dong, why don't you try on this suit?

49
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,560
Xiao Dong, look.

50
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,560
I picked this suit for you.

51
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,560
You've graduated for a long time.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
You should wear it for the interview.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,890
Why did you give me this?

54
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,280
You might as well give me a game console.

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
This suit

56
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,080
cost me months' salary.

57
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,159
Now the label has been cut.

58
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,720
I can't return it.

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Xiao Dong, give it a try.

60
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,160
Try it.

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm not working.

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
What?

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,080
You want me to support you?

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
So annoying.

65
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,840
Let's go. Let's go.

66
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,280
Here, try it.

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,600
No need, Mr. Lin.

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,360
Try it.

69
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,560
Great. The size is perfect.

70
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,360
Mr. Lin.

71
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,360
Such a nice suit.

72
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,480
for me?

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,159
Of course. You look so handsome.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,740
Of course it's for you.

75
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,760
Mr. Lin.

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,760
I feel that you've changed

77
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,159
a different person recently.

78
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,840
Our company

79
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
get off work so early before.

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,360
And I rarely see you smile at work.

81
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,760
I used to be too harsh on people.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,920
But I've been through something recently.

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,780
I've reflected on myself.

84
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,120
Don't worry.

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
I'll get along with everyone in the future.

86
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
If there's nothing else,

87
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
I’m leaving.

88
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,400
Rest early.

89
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
Good night.

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,620
Good night, Mr Lin.

91
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
Honey,

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,320
Can we have dinner together?

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,120
Jin Qiang is very narcissistic.

94
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,159
and arrogant.

95
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,280
The more you ignore him,

96
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,740
he'll get more emotional.

97
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
I ate it.

98
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,320
Why did you eat it? I ate it.

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
Honey.

100
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,960
I think we should talk.

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,400
Stay away from me.

102
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,320
Clean your ass before you go home.

103
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,880
Listen to me, honey.

104
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,320
Honey is not what you think.

105
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,960
Hello, Mr. Lin.

106
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,560
How are you today?

107
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,720
Not bad.

108
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,560
I left everything to Han Ja-myung.

109
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,560
But he seems a little suspicious.

110
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm afraid he won't be able to hide it for long.

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't worry. He's a subordinate anyway.

112
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
Even if I suspect him,

113
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,560
I can't do anything to you.

114
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
How about you?

115
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,520
Do you have enough money?

116
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,159
You sound more and more like me.

117
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,520
Looks like you're into the character.

118
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,250
Don't worry. I've found a new trade opportunity.

119
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,200
I'll send you a video.

120
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,280
Today I'll introduce

121
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,960
This is the special wine of Rong Zi Restaurant.

122
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,960
Amazing.

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
It's 100,000 likes.

124
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,280
In the Internet era,

125
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
Wherever the traffic is,

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
the capital will flow to.

127
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,120
As a qualified businessman,

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Second,

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
Learn to take advantage.

130
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,400
What good health care did you see?

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,080
That makes sense.

132
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll go. Okay.

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,760
Dad! Mom!

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
Isn't this my sister?

135
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,760
She went to live streaming as an Internet celebrity.

136
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,680
Today, let me introduce

137
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,560
This is the special wine of Rong Zi Restaurant.

138
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,600
KOL

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,320
Your sister is going to be rich

140
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Yes.

141
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,559
Xiao Meng.

142
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,960
Daughter.

143
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,840
Congratulations.

144
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,880
Look at my daughter.

145
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,840
She's so smart in business.

146
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,280
Business is so popular now

147
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,640
You must have made a lot of money.

148
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,240
If you want money,

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,560
if you want money.

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,720
I won't give it to you.

151
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,480
Xiao Meng.

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
Watch your mouth.

153
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
Your brother is not young anymore.

154
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,520
He has a boyfriend.

155
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,160
She's quite reliable.

156
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,160
She knows how to live.

157
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,560
She didn't ask for much.

158
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,080
They only asked for 200,000 betrothal gifts.

159
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,760
Yes.

160
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
You made so much money.

161
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Help us reduce our burden.

162
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
What's wrong with helping your brother?

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
Why should I give him the money I earned?

164
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I think he's living with his phone.

165
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,280
Do you have to spend money to get married?

166
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,740
Who are you talking about?

167
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,120
You call me a loser?

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,210
Su Xiaomeng.

169
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,960
Don't think you can forget your name

170
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,820
just because you made some money.

171
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
I'm talking about you.

172
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm at least

173
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,560
who can't even earn a penny.

174
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,520
Okay.

175
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,250
Who's the loser?

176
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,280
Don't go home if you don't pay me today.

177
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,160
Who cares?

178
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,840
Su Xiaomeng.

179
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,160
How dare you!

180
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,820
I think you deserve a beating.

181
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,760
Move. We're family. We don't dare to fight.

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,680
Yeah, she's your daughter after all.

183
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,160
She's not even your biological daughter.

184
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
You can do whatever you want.

185
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,560
Who did?

186
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,840
Tell me.

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,960
Who bullied you?

188
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
If your uncle and I hadn't adopted you,

189
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
you would have starved to death.

190
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,340
Okay, you've grown up, right?

191
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
You don't care about us, do you?

192
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,180
Stop making a fuss.

193
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
No, no, no.

194
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
We can't afford to lose face.

195
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,960
Okay, stop filming if you're embarrassed.

196
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,160
Let's go.

197
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,360
Dad, you're leaving just like that?

198
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,120
Aren't you going to hit me?

199
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,560
What about my betrothal gift?

200
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,680
Come on.

201
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,320
Don't take the money.

202
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,450
Aren't you ashamed?

203
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,360
Leave!

204
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
I'm not embarrassed.

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,360
You're not leaving?

206
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,760
All right.

207
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Can you give me some face?

208
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,480
Baby.

209
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,960
Baby.

210
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,480
Let's go.

211
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,120
Give me some face.

212
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,880
Let's go.

213
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Go home and work.

214
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,120
What do you want for dinner?

215
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
Tomato.

216
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
You're back.

217
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,560
Pretty lady.

218
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,160
My dad bought a lot of delicious food.

219
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,580
and had an ungrateful son.

220
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,720
No.

221
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,840
Come and work with me.

222
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,320
No wonder she's not home.

223
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,840
So

224
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,760
with a married man with a child.

225
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,840
No way.

226
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,760
This is ridiculous.

227
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,480
When will you ask her to go home?

228
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,280
You know her temper.

229
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,480
Who would persuade her when she gets stubborn?

230
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
My dad is right.

231
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,760
In my opinion,

232
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
we should learn from her.

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,560
Now I know where she lives.

234
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,360
When she's not home,

235
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,320
we sneak in

236
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,250
and steal all her valuable things.

237
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,720
She'll have to beg us when she has no money.

238
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,920
Son, you're quite smart.

239
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,960
Let's go, mom.

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,160
Mr. Lin, I saw them getting in the car together.

241
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,620
Help me teach these two bitches a lesson.

242
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,560
Roger.

243
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
Get off. You're here.

244
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,560
Why are you in such a hurry to send him home?

245
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,560
It's been a long time since you talked to me.

246
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,920
Let's go back and talk.

247
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,340
I'm going to take a shower.

248
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
What's wrong?

249
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Lin Jing.
