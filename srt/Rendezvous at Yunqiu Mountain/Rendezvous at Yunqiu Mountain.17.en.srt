1
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,200
[Hello?] Hello.

2
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
Mr. Lin, I just sent you a file.

3
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Take a look.

4
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,760
I don't understand.

5
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Mr. Lin.

6
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,560
The Party B of Purple Sand Town

7
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
invited us to have a field inspection.

8
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
We'd better leave today.

9
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,120
Let's go. Let's go.

10
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,520
Yes.

11
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,960
They want us to work together as soon as possible.

12
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,690
the sooner they can start work.

13
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,600
Let me think about it.

14
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Okay.

15
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,960
Mr. Lin, did you hear that?

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,720
They want me to go on a business trip.

17
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,600
You're not by my side.

18
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm a little worried.

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,760
Don't worry.

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
The contract of the Sand Town

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
has been planned.

22
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Now it's just a process.

23
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
Mr. Han is here.

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
He'll make arrangements. Okay.

25
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,160
Okay.

26
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,800
Okay, bye.

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,880
[Hello?] Hello.

28
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,400
Mr. Jin.

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Han Ziming and Mr. Lin are on a business trip.

30
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,360
It should take a few days.

31
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,480
Okay, I got it.

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
It's time.

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
Do it.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,760
This is the Li Zhuo I told you about.

35
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,000
Mr Jin, I heard there's a big deal.

36
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,320
Just tell me. I promise I'll do it well.

37
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
I heard you want a wife.

38
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,280
Director Jin can find me a wife.

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
Do you like it?

40
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,560
If you like it, I'll give you the betrothal gifts.

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,920
Mr. Jin, he looks pretty.

42
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,959
Is there a trap?

43
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
I've given you a good price.

44
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,760
No, give it to someone else.

45
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,600
Mr. Jin must be right.

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
What's wrong with her?

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,280
Her name is Su Xiaomeng.

48
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,560
You saw her face.

49
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,280
She doesn't have any backers.

50
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
I don't like her.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,280
I need you to control her.

52
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
to stop her from ruining my plan.

53
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,960
Got it.

54
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,159
Just tell me what to do, Director Jin.

55
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,920
I will

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
give you a chance

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,240
to contact you first.

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,960
I'll arrange a lawyer

59
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,960
to be your legal wife.

60
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll pay you

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,760
Director Jin, I'll take the deal.

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,480
Wait for my good news.

63
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,840
Su Xiaomeng.

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,640
This time,

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,300
I'll see how you can turn over.

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,920
Who is this?

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
How did you knock?

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,120
You are...

69
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
Dad, I'm Lee Tak.

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
Isn't this our future son-in-law?

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,520
Mom.

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,040
Son-in-law!

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,440
Come on.

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,100
Have a seat.

75
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,560
Have an orange.

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,200
Okay.

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Her mother...

78
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,920
Let me tell you something.

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,760
Sit down.

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,560
Mom.

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,159
He looks so ugly.

82
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,120
He's older than me.

83
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,960
No matter what,

84
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,000
we raised Xiao Meng.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
So what?

86
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,000
I think this person is very sincere.

87
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,420
Besides, Xiao Meng is not young anymore.

88
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Find someone

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,560
and live an honest life.

90
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
What's wrong with that?

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Xiao Meng is so stubborn now.

92
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,160
She's not like before.

93
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,690
What if she doesn't like it?

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,680
I can coax her.

95
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,360
Okay.

96
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
My son-in-law.

97
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,520
Oh my.

98
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,520
It's nothing.

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
You're welcome.

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,760
What's wrong?

101
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,159
Nothing.

102
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,450
Dad, this is for you.

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,580
You have me.

104
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,760
Thank you.

105
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,000
You are my son-in-law from now on.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,960
Don't be so formal when you come

107
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Thank you.

108
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,120
Don't worry.

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Xiao Meng.

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,120
Han Ziming and Lin Jing

111
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,080
are preparing

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,200
a new project about the Sand Town.

113
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,320
I heard it's time to sign the contract.

114
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,800
Just say it.

115
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,600
Although I was kicked out by the board,

116
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,600
I have no actual power.

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,960
But I have an idea

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,320
to make their new project

119
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,960
with their new project.

120
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,400
Tell me about it.

121
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,360
It's simple.

122
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,040
As long as

123
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,200
their contract,

124
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,920
Once they sign it,

125
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,360
Ono Group

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,560
will be accused of fraud.

127
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,880
Soon,

128
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,560
the stock price of Ono Group will decrease.

129
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,120
And I can make a comeback.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,760
Mr. Jin is really a good player.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,159
That's a tough move.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,040
Looks like Lin Jing and Han Ziming's project

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,920
Lin Jing and Han Ziming's project

134
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,980
before they start.

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Xiao Meng,

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,159
since

137
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,840
we are on the same boat,

138
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,520
I think

139
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,080
we should sign a contract.

140
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,200
Of course, I trust you.

141
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,600
Business is preventive.

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,740
In case one side goes back on his word,

143
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,760
it will be bad

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
it'll be bad, right?

145
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,880
Since the agreement has been signed,

146
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,760
you should show some sincerity.

147
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,200
What do you mean?

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
For example, Du Li Li lived in the villa in the western suburbs.

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
in the villa in the western suburbs.

150
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,210
It's a welcome gift.

151
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,360
No problem.

152
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,920
As long as this is done,

153
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,290
let alone the villa,

154
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm yours too.

155
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,810
I look forward to working with you.

156
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
Just wait and see.

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Hello, Xiao Meng.

158
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,080
There's something you need to pay attention to.

159
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,440
The contract of the Sand Town

160
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,880
must be checked carefully.

161
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,340
Don't let your guard down.

162
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Xiao Meng.

163
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
Is Xiao Meng here?

164
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,360
Your mom is here.

165
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
I'll go meet her.

166
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Keep in touch.

167
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,760
Xiao Meng.

168
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,560
What's up?

169
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
I know you don't want to see me,

170
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
or go home.

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
But your dad went to the hospital for a checkup.

172
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
It's not good.

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,200
I want you to go home and have dinner with him.

174
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
and chat with him.

175
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Take pity on him.

176
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
Shameless!

177
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,480
I raised you up.

178
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
I don't need your reward.

179
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,680
but you still come back to live off your parents.

180
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,610
Go find a job if you don't have a job.

181
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,280
Get lost!

182
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,720
Your brother is not young anymore.

183
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,360
He's dating someone.

184
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,720
I don't want much.

185
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
They only asked for 200,000 betrothal gifts.

186
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,160
You made so much money.

187
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
Help us reduce our burden.

188
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,460
What's wrong with helping your brother?

189
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
I don't think

190
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
between us.

191
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't come to me again.

192
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,760
We are no longer a family.

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,160
Xiao Meng,

194
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,960
your dad is in poor health.

195
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,360
If anything happens to him,

196
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,800
you can't even see him for the last time.

197
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,720
won't you regret it?

198
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,480
If I refuse,

199
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
what if Su Xiaomeng

200
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,490
miss something important,

201
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,650
I might feel guilty for the rest of my life.

202
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,120
Fine.

203
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,920
But don't try to kidnap me with emotions.

204
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,520
If you have other intentions,

205
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,050
I won't cooperate with you.

206
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,800
Got it.

207
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
Got it.

208
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,360
Let's go home.

209
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Let's go.

210
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Let's go.

211
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,290
The fish has taken the bait.

212
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Act as planned.

213
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,320
Xiao Meng,

214
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
This is your favorite chicken soup

215
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,960
your favorite chicken soup.

216
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,760
Here.

217
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,800
Drink it.

218
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,240
This is...

219
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Look at you now.

220
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,600
working so hard.

221
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,280
This chicken soup is good for your health.

222
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,920
Mom

223
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,280
for you.

224
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,600
Drink it.

225
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,880
Just cut to the chase.

226
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't waste time.

227
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,520
Xiao Meng.

228
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Here's the thing.

229
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,880
You're so good at your job now.

230
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
Dad and mom

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,920
I'm proud of you.

232
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes.

233
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,000
Xiao Meng.

234
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,160
Xiao Meng, what's wrong?

235
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,800
There's something wrong with the dish.
