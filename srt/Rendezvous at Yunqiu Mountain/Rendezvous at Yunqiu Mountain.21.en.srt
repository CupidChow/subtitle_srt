1
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
It's snowing

2
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,720
It's so beautiful.

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
Ziming.

4
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm so happy today.

5
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,280
Yes.

6
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,320
Since you smiled,

7
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,240
we feel much better.

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,440
What do you think?

9
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,360
As long as you're happy,

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm happy.

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,120
Happy New Year.

12
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,720
You scared me.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,260
I thought you were going to confess to me.

14
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,120
Yes.

15
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
I like you.

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm not the Mr. Lin you like.

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,440
I...

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,240
I am...

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,700
I know you are Su Xiaomeng.

20
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,480
How did you know?

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
Mr. Lin said

22
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,240
we can't let others

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,600
know our identity.

24
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,680
Otherwise, you'll be in danger.

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,520
Mr. Lin and I grew up together.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,120
She can't hide anything from me.

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
You scared me.

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,920
I thought you like Mr. Lin.

29
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,120
I like you, Xiao Meng.

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,450
After what happened to you,

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,040
I realized

32
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,100
I like you from the bottom of my heart.

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,800
You don't have to give me an answer.

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,040
From now on,

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,640
in front of me.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
Okay?

37
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Okay.

38
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,780
Don't catch a cold.

39
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Dad and beautiful lady

40
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,720
like each other.

41
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,120
But with my dad's ink,

42
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,680
when he confesses

43
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,280
with the pretty lady,

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,720
a beautiful lady would have been abducted.

45
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,520
I need to help her.

46
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,120
Dad, beautiful lady,

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,200
Come and help me pile the snowman.

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,440
Coming.

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,560
Dad, look. These two snowmen are close.

50
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,810
and warm each other,

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
Don't you feel cold?

52
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,920
Silly girl.

53
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,240
Do you think snowmen are afraid of cold like you?

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,640
They can resist the cold.

55
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,800
Unromantic.

56
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm so worried.

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,720
Dad.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,130
Look, beautiful lady's hands are red.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,360
My hands are red.

60
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,200
Let me see.

61
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,120
It must be cold.

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,840
Is it warm?

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,700
This house will be disbanded without me.

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,840
The CP I knocked must be locked.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,370
Are you okay?

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,600
I also prepared this.

67
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Warm yourself up.

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,120
Osmanthus wine

69
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,080
It's good.

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm glad you like it.

71
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,100
What about you?

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,480
Do you like it?

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Do you like me?

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,120
Dad.

75
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,760
Why didn't you take out

76
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Why didn't you take it out?

77
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,680
I like it.

78
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
like you.

79
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,680
If I become Su Xiaomeng one day,

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,940
will you still like me?

81
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,660
No matter what you become,

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
I like you

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,400
is you.

84
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,280
Smash them all!

85
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,320
Smash them all. Okay.

86
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,240
One more.

87
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,700
I'll give you 10,000 more.

88
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,320
Okay.

89
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,980
I have a secret to tell you.

90
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,320
Actually,

91
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,320
the son of Mr. Lu of Rong Zi Restaurant.

92
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,640
Sure.

93
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,080
It turns out that when I talked to you about cooperation,

94
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
when I talked to you about collaboration.

95
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,480
You did it on purpose, didn't you? You're right. You're right.
