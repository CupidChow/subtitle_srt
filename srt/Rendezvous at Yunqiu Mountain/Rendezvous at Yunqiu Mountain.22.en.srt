1
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,200
You're doing it on purpose. You're doing it on purpose. You're doing it on purpose. You're doing it on purpose.

2
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,320
You did it on purpose.

3
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,759
No.

4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,720
I didn't mean to hide it.

5
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,240
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,560
What?

7
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,039
Someone broke the wine in the warehouse.

8
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,560
Yes.

9
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
It must be Jin Qiang. Let's go. Let's go.

10
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
Coward! Coward! Coward!

11
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,680
He asked us to deliver the goods on purpose.

12
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,120
to deliver the goods on time.

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,960
The new brands made by the group

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,400
will be questioned as soon as it is launched.

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,329
The company will also be in danger.

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,120
I'll help you this time.

17
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
You...

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,680
Tell them yourself.

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,440
Rong Zi Restaurant is my family business.

20
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,400
Don’t worry about the delivery.

21
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,660
I asked them to get the inventory from other places.

22
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
but they didn't destroy him.

23
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,840
I didn't expect Lu Xiao

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,120
the son of Mr. Lu of Rong Zi Restaurant.

25
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
But he has a son.

26
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,720
Xiaoping.

27
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,000
What’s wrong? What happened?

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
Xiaoping is missing.

29
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,940
Have you searched the school?

30
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,440
No.

31
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,760
I thought he came here.

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,880
Ping’an has always been a good boy.

33
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,640
Did he go to his classmate's house?

34
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
He'll tell me in advance

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
he will tell me in advance.

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,200
Let’s split up.

37
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,960
Xiaoping.

38
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
Ping’an.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,530
Ping’an.

40
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
Ping’an.

41
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,730
Little Ping’an.

42
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,680
Little Ping’an.

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Little Ping’an.

44
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,240
Ping’an.

45
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,600
Where are you?

46
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,200
Xiao Meng.

47
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,880
How is it?

48
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
I've searched everywhere

49
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
I've searched everywhere.

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
We have to call the police.

51
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,090
Okay.

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,980
It's Jin Qiang.

53
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,159
I want you to meet someone I know.

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,360
Come, see if it's familiar.

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,680
Jin Qiang, if you hurt my son,

56
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
I won't forgive you.

57
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,960
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

58
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,940
Exchange it with Lin Jing.

59
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,040
Listen.

60
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,010
If you dare to call the police, don't see your son.

61
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,880
He's coming for me.

62
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll go change.

63
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,320
It's a safety positioning.

64
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,080
Location.

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,740
I sent it with a child's watch.

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
That's great.

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,480
I'll buy some time.

68
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Call the police.

69
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,800
No.

70
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,680
Jin Qiang wants to see me.

71
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
I've informed Zi Ming and Xiao Meng.

72
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,480
I know what Jin Qiang wants.

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Trust me.

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,120
Let's go.

75
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
Jin Qiang is so despicable.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,360
He doesn't even spare his child.

77
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,720
I will make him pay

78
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,440
for his actions.

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,770
I've called the police.

80
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
From what I know about Jin Qiang,

81
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,360
he struggled

82
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
to extort more money.

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,000
Notify the audit department and the lawyer to file a lawsuit.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
PR will announce his evil deeds.

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Compared to before,

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,920
you've grown a lot.

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,850
You can deal with problems calmly.

88
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,890
Don't worry.

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
You’ll be fine.

90
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,010
Little Ping’an.

91
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
This is it.

92
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll go in first.

93
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,860
Be careful.

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
Lu Xiao.

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
Leave me alone. Save Xiaoping first.

96
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,650
Okay.

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,240
Mom, I knew you would come.

98
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm not scared at all.

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,040
You're so brave.

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,760
Let's go.

101
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,000
Su Xiaomeng.

102
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,800
Trying to escape?

103
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,280
It's not that easy.

104
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,440
Where's Lin Jing? Why isn't she here?

105
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,080
Stop struggling.

106
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,120
It's useless.

107
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,000
Su Xiaomeng.

108
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
I knew

109
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,920
this day would come.

110
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,360
But I don't regret it.

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
I couldn't kill Lin Jing.

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,960
I'll kill you today.

113
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
You're crazy.

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
No one can get

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,400
no one can get it.

116
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,040
Since God doesn't help me,

117
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,480
then you all go to hell!

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
Don’t hurt my mom.

119
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,800
Xiao Meng, Xiao Ping’an.

120
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,120
Let’s go. Don’t move.

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,040
Du Li Li, what are you doing?

122
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,320
I mean to scare them.

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,200
What do you mean?

124
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,000
At this point,

125
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,400
what else can I do?

126
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,840
I've been with you for so many years.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,320
I've done everything for you.

128
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,960
[A woman's dignity.]

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,360
Youth.

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,360
But in your heart,

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,280
in your heart.

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,960
You've never loved me.

133
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,840
Then let's die together.

134
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,760
You're crazy.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you want to die, die by yourself.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
I don't want to die.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,640
You can't live alone if I die.
