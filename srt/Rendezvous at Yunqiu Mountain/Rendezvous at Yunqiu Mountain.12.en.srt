1
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,600
Come on. Let's go.

2
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,100
You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you? Let's go.

3
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
Have a seat.

4
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,080
Today is our love anniversary.

5
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,360
Of course I should dress up.

6
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,240
After all,

7
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,680
it's been a long time

8
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,920
for a long time.

9
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,840
It's my fault.

10
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,880
Honey, let's eat.

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,720
Have some, honey.

12
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,600
Thank you, honey.

13
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,730
I ordered it for you.

14
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
You like this.

15
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Thank you, honey.

16
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,040
Come and eat

17
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,960
Have a taste.

18
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,850
What about the wine?

19
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,620
I'll have some more. Okay.

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
Honey.

21
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,720
You're more considerate at home.

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,760
Honey, let me pour you some more.

23
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,490
Let me eat some vegetables.

24
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,040
Jin Qiang and Lin Jing

25
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
In the private room on the second floor of Tianhua Restaurant.

26
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,240
Tianhua Restaurant.

27
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,480
Ask around.

28
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,160
Everyone in the company

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,840
Open sesame!

30
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,560
Open the door.

31
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
Will Mr. Lin forgive this jerk?

32
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Lin, are you okay?

33
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,720
Jin...

34
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,680
Director Jin

35
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,160
He's sleeping soundly.

36
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,320
I thought...

37
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
What do you think?

38
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,120
We made up.

39
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
How is that possible?

40
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Looks like Mr. Lin already knew.

41
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,770
I won't bother you then.

42
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,920
I've never seen you so nervous.

43
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,920
It seems that you care about my personal life.

44
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,680
I just don't want to make Mr. Lin sad.

45
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Can you help me?

46
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,170
As long as I can help you,

47
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
I'll do anything.

48
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,920
Really?

49
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,120
Hit him for me.

50
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,240
Just kidding.

51
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,010
I really want to beat him up.

52
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,280
I know what Jin Qiang did to me.

53
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,680
I will make him pay the price.

54
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
But when the time is right.

55
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,480
Why did I sleep on the sofa?

56
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,360
Mr. Jin, wake up.

57
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
You were drunk last night.

58
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,290
and slept on the sofa all night.

59
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,840
Did Lin Jing check my phone yesterday?

60
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,880
No.

61
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,320
Mr. Lin went to bed early.

62
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,000
He went out early this morning.

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,440
Okay, go ahead.

64
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
Why are you here?

65
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,410
You still know to come to me?

66
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,920
Do you know this is an emergency?

67
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,160
When Lin Jing was looking at me,

68
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
Bah! Are you playing dumb?

69
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
Do you want to get back together with her?

70
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,520
Are you trying to get rid of me?

71
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,050
What are you talking about?

72
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Can you stop thinking too much?

73
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,480
Me?

74
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay, let me ask you.

75
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
You didn't answer my phone all day yesterday.

76
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,970
Where did you go?

77
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,570
I was doing something serious.

78
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,840
Business?

79
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,960
Your business is meeting a waitress privately.

80
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,159
to have candlelight dinner with your wife.

81
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,840
Director Jin, you're so busy.

82
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
I was about to tell you.

83
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,360
I just want to test

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,090
the waiter called Su Xiaomeng.

85
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
As for Lin Jing,

86
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,560
we're just pretending.

87
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,360
After all, we're not divorced yet.

88
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Don't always

89
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
at this moment, okay?

90
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,280
I can't.

91
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
I'll wait here.

92
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,320
you'll reconcile with her.

93
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,560
and kick me out.

94
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Stop causing me trouble at this time, okay?

95
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,220
You finally said what's on your mind.

96
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,360
Am I a trouble to you?

97
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,680
You said it yourself.

98
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
I didn't say that.

99
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,080
Du Li Li.

100
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,960
If you keep being unreasonable,

101
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,010
just pretend I didn't come.

102
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Go away.

103
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,580
You're heartless.

104
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,159
I've been following you for so long.

105
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,840
You think I'm annoying,

106
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,320
you kicked me out, right?

107
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,559
Jin Qiang, listen.

108
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm not a pushover.

109
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,159
If you want to kick me off,

110
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,160
I'll tell everyone about

111
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,690
about Lin Jing's property.

112
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,920
At worst,

113
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
we'll die together.

114
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,480
Baby.

115
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,720
Look at you.

116
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,850
Why do you always think of me like this?

117
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,200
Lin Jing and I

118
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,160
with Lin Jing.

119
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Then you're the only one in my heart.

120
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,480
Calm down.

121
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
Wait for me.

122
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,480
Then...

123
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,240
our good days

124
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,400
will be here soon.

125
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,210
Don't go on a date with your wife again.

126
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,120
I swear.

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,120
And you have to promise

128
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,960
you won't go to Su Xiaomeng again.

129
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,760
No problem.

130
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,890
That's more like it.

131
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay.

132
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,160
You didn't rest well yesterday, right?

133
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
Look at the dark circles.

134
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,760
You should rest early too.

135
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,560
It's night.

136
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,960
Can we go later?

137
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
I'll see you later.

138
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,360
Okay.

139
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
Go get the stuff.

140
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm leaving.

141
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Hello, Du Li Li.

142
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
Go back to the office now.

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,280
I need you to take care of something urgent.

144
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,960
Okay.

145
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,020
I'll be right back.

146
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,690
Why are you asking me to work overtime now?

147
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,160
Did Director Du make a mistake?

148
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
Why am I the only one working overtime?

149
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
No way.

150
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,240
Mr. Jin arranged this.

151
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,760
These documents are urgent.

152
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,880
Give them to me tomorrow morning.

153
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,080
How can I finish

154
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,720
How can I finish it alone?

155
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,960
Are you asking me?

156
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
Figure it out yourself.

157
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,920
I have to go now.

158
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,840
Director Du.

159
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,240
Are we having a team dinner today?

160
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,040
Yes.

161
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,080
It's on me. It's on me. It's on me. It's on me. It's on me.

162
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,120
Li...

163
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,000
Did you offend Vice President Jin?

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,560
Why do you work overtime on this day?

165
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,840
Vice President Jin prepared food for you.

166
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Thank you.

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,940
I'll get going.

168
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,040
You have no conscience.

169
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,720
You were so affectionate just now.

170
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,560
You want me to work overtime?

171
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,720
Mrs. Zhang.

172
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,880
What are we having for dinner? I'm starving.

173
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,280
Director Jin is like this.

174
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,940
Mr. Lin and the others made BBQ

175
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,330
They took all the ingredients at home.

176
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,240
Barbecue

177
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,040
Yes.

178
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
He didn't tell me.

179
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Where is she?

180
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm going to see her.

181
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
Director Jin, you're late.

182
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,120
I think it's almost over.

183
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,760
Shall I prepare something for you?

184
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,720
Help yourself.

185
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
Okay, go ahead.

186
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm starving.

187
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
You only give me this?

188
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,440
Hello.

189
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,240
Your takeout.

190
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,760
Hello. Hello. Hello.

191
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Okay. Okay. Okay.
