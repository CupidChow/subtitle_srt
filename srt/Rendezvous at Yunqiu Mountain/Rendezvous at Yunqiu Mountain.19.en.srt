1
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,120
It's... It's...

2
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Tell me.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,320
Jin Qiang and Du Li Li.

4
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,199
Since you said the mastermind,

5
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I can apply to reduce your sentence.

6
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,760
But I'm warning you.

7
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,160
If you touch Su Xiaomeng again,

8
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,360
Su Xiaomeng again,

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
I won't let you go.

10
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,240
I promise, Mr. Lin.

11
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,720
I heard that

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,760
the Su family and Jin Qiang have colluded.

13
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,800
They want to play badger game.

14
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,040
Otherwise, how could they...

15
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,640
accept your betrothal gifts

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,130
after receiving your betrothal gift?

17
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Lin.

18
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,960
You mean

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,860
they are working together to fool me?

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,280
You have to ask them yourself.

21
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Thank you, Mr Lin.

22
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,000
You're welcome.

23
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,730
Get out. Get out.

24
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,500
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

25
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200
Find someone to keep an eye on him.

26
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,320
If you find any clues,

27
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
any clue.

28
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,160
Okay, I'll arrange it.

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
See?

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,730
He can't do anything right.

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,400
What if

32
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,720
What if he gives us away?

33
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Just do it.

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,240
Does he have evidence?

35
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,360
He has no evidence.

36
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
He's just a nobody

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,560
with no status.

38
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
If I say one word,

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,000
what he said is slander.

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,660
Slander, you know?

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,760
But Lin Jing is not easy to deal with.

42
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,320
What if she finds out about us?

43
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Follow the clues?

44
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,320
Lin Jing thought she was smart.

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,200
I've been playing

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,360
a long time ago.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
What is this?

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,040
This is called a diversion.

49
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,440
On the surface,

50
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,760
for the betrothal gifts.

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
Actually the real show

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,440
has already started.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
What do you mean?

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Lin Jing likes to uphold justice.

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,480
Doesn't she like

56
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,080
meddle in others' business?

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
This time,

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,159
this time.

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,640
This is the information of the capital chain I forged.

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
It involves Su Xiaomeng

61
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,440
and all the funds of her new job.

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,640
If this is leaked,

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Lin Jing will not only

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
take the blame for Su Xiaomeng,

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,560
and you'll get into trouble.

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
Honey.

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,560
Your move is so clever.

68
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,640
In this game,

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,160
I'm the only player.

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
The rest are pawns.

71
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,600
This time, I want to see

72
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,560
how long she can protect her.

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,040
What's wrong?

74
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,200
Your Su family tricked me.

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,960
Now you want to deny it? No way.

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,040
Tak. No.

77
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,800
Son-in-law.

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
Let's talk nicely.

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's not rush, okay?

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,920
Why should I?

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,040
If you don't pay me back today, don't blame me for being rude.

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
No, let's take our time.

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,720
Brother-in-law, calm down.

84
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,600
I'll find a way to pay you back.

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,720
Sure.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
I'll pay you back now.

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
How about your family?

88
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
My neck.

89
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, honey.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I beg you.

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
Can you lend me the betrothal gifts?

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,040
My brother-in-law is here.

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
What does it have to do with me?

94
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,200
You don't count.

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,760
You've been doing nothing

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,480
for so many years.

97
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,010
How much did you spend on me?

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,920
You pay me back the 200,000 yuan.

99
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Hey.

100
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,880
Brother-in-law.

101
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,520
Please give me two more days.

102
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,000
Something's wrong with the contract in the Sand Town.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,640
We were tricked by Jin Qiang.

104
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,560
This contract seems fine,

105
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,840
But look here.

106
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,400
It's about money circulation.

107
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,800
is obviously a trap.

108
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,520
What's more vicious is

109
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,760
he knew

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,300
we couldn't find direct evidence about him.

111
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,159
Jin Qiang's plan this time

112
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,400
not only wants to put the company in trouble,

113
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,480
but also

114
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,010
my reputation in Ono Group.

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
What a feint.

116
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
He set a trap in the contract

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
and made public opinion

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,260
to lead the spear to me.

119
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,440
What a good plan.

120
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,600
But he didn't expect

121
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
we still have Plan B.

122
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,440
Jin Qiang.

123
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,840
Since you want to play,

124
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,640
we'll play along.

125
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
Director Zhu.

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,240
Thank you

127
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,440
these days.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,720
Let's not talk about work today.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
Take it as a vacation.

130
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
and relax.

131
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,920
Miss Du,

132
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
It’s inappropriate.

133
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Director Zhu.

134
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,120
Why are you still so reserved?

135
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
I heard that

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,240
you are

137
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,200
in the world.

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
How can I not enjoy

139
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,120
like today?

140
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,440
Miss Du.

141
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,880
You’re so sweet.

142
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,330
I'll listen to you tonight.

143
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,380
Let's not talk about work.

144
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,160
Director Zhu.

145
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760
you are

146
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,880
in our group.

147
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
I

148
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,480
I also admire

149
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,680
a successful person like you.

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
Today,

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I prepared

152
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,880
a surprise for you.

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Don't let me down.

154
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,559
Director Zhu.

155
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,440
Come on.

156
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,570
What are you doing? Let's go. Let's go.

157
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,680
Lili.

158
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,000
You're still useful.

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,320
The negative information of the company is overwhelming lately.

160
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,840
Investors and media

161
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,000
are questioning our source of funds.

162
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I suggest

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,960
to temporarily remove Lin Jing's position as president

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,400
and cooperate with the audit investigation.

165
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,440
Sand Town is

166
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,400
the core project of Ono Group.

167
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,040
If I leave now,

168
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
the company will be in danger.

169
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
I hope

170
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,320
you can help me

171
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
with me,

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
instead of using me as a scapegoat.

173
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,040
This concerns the company's future.

174
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
Please think twice.

175
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,640
Mr. Lin, your decision is indeed highlighted.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,680
But this time,

177
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,800
you have no responsibility at all?

178
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
The stock price is plummeting.

179
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,360
The investors withdrew their investment.

180
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,000
Everyone in the company is complaining.

181
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
Even if the board doesn't take action,

182
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,920
you won't be able to get away unscathed.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
I will be responsible for my decision.

184
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,560
But Director Zhu,

185
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,320
I hope

186
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,200
you can be responsible for your actions.

187
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
In that case,

188
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,360
For the company's overall interests,

189
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,240
just follow my suggestion.

190
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Any objections?

191
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,320
OK, I hope

192
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
can make the town

193
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,640
without me,

194
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,960
without me.

195
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,800
Otherwise,

196
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
not only the group,

197
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
everyone here

198
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,560
will pay the price

199
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,660
for today's decision.

200
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,120
Director Zhu has a lot of tricks.

201
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,920
Director Zhu.

202
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,600
I think we should take this to the board

203
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,720
and let my colleagues learn from it.

204
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,440
What do you want me to do?

205
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,400
Director Zhu.

206
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,120
What can I do?

207
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,260
I just want you to be on my side.

208
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Make it clear.

209
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,040
I've taken care of

210
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
in the company.

211
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,960
With your shares,

212
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,760
I can impeach Lin Jing.

213
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,720
In this way,

214
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,160
I can take back the control of the group.

215
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,880
What do you want me to do?

216
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,490
What do you want me to do?

217
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
They're gone.

218
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,700
Nice working with you.

219
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,320
Mr. Lin.

220
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,800
The audit department is coming to your office.

221
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,130
They said they would take you to question.

222
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
I know.

223
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,600
Mr. Lin is not just asking questions.

224
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
You know.

225
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,620
Although Jin Qiang was fired,

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
the power behind him is still there.

227
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,580
He will take this opportunity to target you.

228
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,800
Ziming, you know what?

229
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,200
I tried my best

230
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
to prove myself

231
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
that I can really support Ono Group.

232
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,920
But now it seems

233
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,800
I can't be a good president at all.

234
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
No, Mr. Lin.

235
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
You've always been the best.

236
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,600
You can't deny yourself

237
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,100
You can't keep denying yourself.

238
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
Ziming.

239
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,520
Thank you for trusting me.

240
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,760
But you don't understand.

241
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
I'm not the Mr. Lin in your heart.

242
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
I...

243
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,160
No matter how hard I try,

244
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,960
I can't become her.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What Ono Group needs

246
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,040
someone like me.
