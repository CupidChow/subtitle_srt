1
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,680
Come on, Han Ziming.

2
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,520
Can't you knock when you come in?

3
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,320
You left your hand at home.

4
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,039
Sorry, Director Jin.

5
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,080
Mr. Lin is not feeling well today.

6
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,810
so he won't come to the company.

7
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,720
Please arrange these tasks.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,280
Okay.

9
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,960
Put it here.

10
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,480
Why are people around Lin Jing

11
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,120
are so annoying.

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't worry.

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
They won't last long.

14
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Hello.

15
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,090
Is this the house you rent? Yes.

16
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,600
It's you.

17
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
It's hard to get a taxi here.

18
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,620
There's no bus either.

19
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
Are you lost?

20
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,480
Here.

21
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,040
You want to give me tips?

22
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,160
What a coincidence.

23
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
You want to rent a house?

24
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,240
I heard there's an empty house nearby.

25
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
so I stopped by.

26
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
The house next door has been vacant for years.

27
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,440
I didn't want to rent it,

28
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,920
but we're destined to meet.

29
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
I'll show you later.

30
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,040
By the way,

31
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,640
introduce yourself.

32
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
My name is Lu Xiao.

33
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,090
A carefree Xiao.

34
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,290
I'm the wine maker of Rong Zi Restaurant. What about you?

35
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,280
My name is...

36
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm Su Xiaomeng.

37
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
The Dawn of Dawn

38
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,159
Dream of dreams

39
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,520
I didn't expect

40
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,720
you're quite artistic.

41
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,240
Not really.

42
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,240
I just love life.

43
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,720
It's cold.

44
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Don't stand here and come in.

45
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,320
Come on.

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,440
Have a seat.

47
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
You're indeed a wine maker.

48
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
These are all wine from Rong Zi Restaurant.

49
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,720
Do you want to try it?

50
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
I didn't expect to see a house like this.

51
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,850
I didn't say I'd rent it.

52
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,920
Hey, it's okay.

53
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,480
You are my guest.

54
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,780
You like wine culture so much.

55
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,960
I've liked drinking since I was a kid.

56
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,640
Try it first.

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,680
It took me a year to travel around the world.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,159
to learn wine brewing.

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
At the same time, I brought the wine

60
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,280
all over the world.

61
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Try this.

62
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
What do you think?

63
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,380
Which one do you like the most?

64
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Good taste.

65
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
This is the seasonal wine from our Rong Zi Restaurant.

66
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,040
I think it tastes very good.

67
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,040
It's as good as foreign brands.

68
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
The local wine is good

69
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
But the sales are average

70
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,800
But people who bought it said it's good.

71
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,860
That's easy to say.

72
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,280
I can invest in

73
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,320
the wine of Rong Zi Hotel.

74
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,280
Let's work together to develop.

75
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,080
You...

76
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,920
I know Lin Jing, president of Ono Group.

77
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,520
They are going to hold a commercial cocktail party.

78
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,450
I can recommend the wine party of Rong Zi Restaurant.

79
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
Then what?

80
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
Show your imagination.

81
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,480
We can give the wine set an empty shell

82
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
and then cover it.

83
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,520
and export overseas.

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,050
You don't have to stay in the domestic market.

85
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm not that ambitious.

86
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm more flexible

87
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,360
about selling wine.

88
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,440
As long as the buyer knows how to appreciate it.

89
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,440
How much can it sell?

90
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm not pursuing it on purpose.

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,480
Please.

92
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,680
I really hope the wine tastes so good

93
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,360
Let more people know

94
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,700
How about this?

95
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,360
I'll sell them first.

96
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
If I sell well,

97
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,600
prove my ability,

98
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,440
Let's work together for the cocktail party.

99
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,170
How much do you want?

100
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,159
Three boxes.

101
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,280
300 boxes in three days.

102
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,160
300 boxes? That's their monthly sales.

103
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,640
You can't finish it.

104
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I...

105
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,520
There's no impossible in my dictionary.

106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,280
Watch out!

107
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,880
Let’s go. Let’s go.

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,920
He’s here. He’s here.

109
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,490
He’s my son. He’s my son.

110
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
He’s my son.

111
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,840
Xiaoping.

112
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,919
Call Aunt Su.

113
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,120
Hello, Aunt Su.

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,600
You're so pretty. You're here. You're here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

115
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,659
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

116
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
He's shy.

117
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,880
He's quite sensible.

118
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,450
When are you going to the hotel to get the goods for me?

119
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
Tomorrow. But have you figured out how to sell it?

120
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,640
Don't worry. I know what to do.

121
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,600
Today, let me introduce

122
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
This is the special wine of Rong Zi Restaurant.

123
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,800
Daning is thick and full.

124
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,040
and fragrant fruit.

125
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
There's a promotion for shopping

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Come here.

127
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,480
Three bowls are not enough

128
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
Special red wine for free.

129
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,040
Sir,

130
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,000
come and take a look at the wine of Rong Zi Restaurant.

131
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
Let me introduce.

132
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,560
the wine of Rong Zi Restaurant.

133
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,840
is thick and full.

134
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,040
Fragrance and fragrance

135
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,360
Please have a taste.

136
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,160
This is our sample.

137
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,600
Try it.

138
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,600
It tastes good.

139
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,720
You can buy it now.

140
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,120
If you buy a box,

141
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,400
you can experience our wax dyeing activity.

142
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,560
Really Yeah

143
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,520
It's a local wax dye technique

144
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay.

145
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
Ten boxes.

146
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,290
Ten boxes. Okay.

147
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Ten boxes.

148
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,520
Okay.

149
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,280
And try the wax dying technique.

150
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes.

151
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Have a look.

152
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,960
I just bought ten boxes.

153
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,880
It's delicious.

154
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,000
You sold all 300 boxes?

155
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,040
You sold 300 boxes

156
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,660
and sold 300 boxes, right?

157
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
You found out.

158
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,920
I gave him a lot of money.

159
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,320
Anyway, you did it.

160
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,480
I admit defeat. I'll go to the cocktail party with you.

161
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
Sales genius, let me peel an orange for you.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,560
Mr. Lin, this is the financial report.

163
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,400
Mr. Lin, this is the guest list of the party.
