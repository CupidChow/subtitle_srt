1
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,160
I can tell you clearly

2
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,360
you don't have the right.

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,880
I have no right.

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,940
You have the right.

5
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,600
How dare you talk to me like that?

6
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,760
You just have Lin Jing behind your back.

7
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,360
You can do whatever you want.

8
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,880
Since Director Jin said so,

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll call Mr. Lin now

10
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,760
to make the decision.

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,000
Come on. Come on.

12
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,170
Come on. Come on.

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't. Don't.

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I won't argue with you.

15
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,960
I won't argue with you.

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,720
Look.

17
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,079
Take it home.

18
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,329
Get back to work.

19
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,890
Jin Qiang, you have no conscience.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let me tell you.

21
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm already annoyed.

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,890
You'd better stop causing me trouble.

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
I know you've been tired of me.

24
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,780
You want to kick me out.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
I can't walk when I see you.

26
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
It's good now.

27
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,400
the whole company knows.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
You're a joke now.

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,920
Are you done?

30
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,250
Get lost if you're done.

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,320
You betrayer!

32
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm going to die.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Du Li Li.

34
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Let me tell you.

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,400
this is a critical period.

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
If you keep this up,

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,800
our relationship will be exposed.

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
I can't protect you then.

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,880
We are tied together.

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,720
If you transfer assets without permission,

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,880
You'll go to jail.

42
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,960
Do you understand?

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,400
What should we do now?

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm going to apologize to Lin Jing.

45
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,880
I haven't got the property yet.

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,079
I can't get a divorce.

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
So you...

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,880
don't make any more trouble.

49
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,400
Do you hear me?

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,960
Honey.

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,320
Is this your seat?

52
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Where's my wife?

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Mr. Jin doesn't know it as her husband.

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
How would I know?

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,720
You don't have to be so weird.

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,450
I haven't got even with you yet.

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,420
Why did you hurt me last night?

58
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
I'm just a secretary.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,200
Even if you lend me 100 guts,

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,860
I wouldn't dare to offend you.

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,959
You misunderstood me.

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I just wanted to celebrate your birthday

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,720
with my colleagues.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,880
I didn't expect you to do this.

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,400
Director Jin,

66
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
I advise you

67
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,020
not to show up in front of your employees.

68
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,880
Don't be so smug.

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,060
Do you think I can't deal with you?

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,760
Let me tell you.

71
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,240
I've taught you a lot.

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,159
Wait for me.

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm so scared.

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Director Jin threatened me.

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,480
Last night, you harassed me in front of so many people.

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,760
If you fail, you'll take revenge.

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,820
Everyone in the company is watching.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Director Jin.

79
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
If anything happens to me,

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,920
if anything happens to me.

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
Think about it.

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,320
Honey.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I've been too busy with work lately.

84
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,600
and stressed out.

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,360
That bitch Su Xiaomeng.

86
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
At this time,

87
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
She seduced me

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,160
and asked me out alone.

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,600
Bah!

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
I don't want to talk to her.

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
Honey.

92
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,010
I've made up my mind.

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,200
I'll focus

94
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
I'll live a good life with you.

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,120
I will never make such a mistake again.

96
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,680
A fly won't bite the seamless egg.

97
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,600
No, honey.

98
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
I know I was wrong.

99
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
I'll turn over a new leaf.

100
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,880
I'll be a new person.

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
Get up. The floor is cold.

102
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,080
Don't do it again.

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,760
But your video was uploaded online.

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,480
and made a fuss.

105
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,880
This incident

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,760
has a bad influence on Ono Group.

107
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,000
Even if I don't pursue you,

108
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,560
the shareholders will fire you.

109
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
I've thought about it.

110
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,410
As long as you take the lead,

111
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,800
others will give you face.

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,080
They will show me mercy.

113
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,760
So, honey,

114
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,000
I beg you.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,520
Please help me.

116
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,320
Try your best.

117
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,600
It seems that Lin Jing is not easy to fool.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,920
I have to do something.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
Mr. Xu.

120
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,000
I hope you can support me

121
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,880
I sincerely hope you can support me.

122
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,720
Mr. Wang.

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
This is just a gift for you.

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,080
When it's done,

125
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,200
I have money.

126
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,120
Mr. Zhang.

127
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,280
Mr. Xu.

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,930
The password is your birthday.

129
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,160
Come on.

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,080
Don't worry.

131
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,200
What happened to Jin Qiang

132
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,760
has caused bad influence to the group.

133
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,400
All directors are here today.

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,800
Let's vote for Jin Qiang.

135
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,400
Raise your hand if you agree to stay.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I agree.

137
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,280
Me too.

138
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,720
Me too.

139
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
It tickles.

140
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
Turn it off.

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Turn it off!

142
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Honey.

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,080
It's not like that.

144
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,520
No.

145
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,200
Jin Qiang.

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,000
This is the board.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,760
not our home.

148
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,080
I have to say

149
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,480
Someone hurt me first.

150
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,120
They all set me up.

151
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,200
Mr. Jin,

152
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Your personal disgrace

153
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,320
has greatly affected the group.

154
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,160
I suggest

155
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,000
to fire Jin Qiang from all his duties.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
and acquire his shares.

157
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,559
Raise your hand if you agree.

158
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Gosh.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Dismissed.

160
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Honey.

161
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,760
Don't be so cruel.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,760
For the sake of our relationship,

163
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,160
please give me a chance.

164
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,080
to be a couple.

165
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,800
You had an affair.

166
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,960
Everyone knows about this.

167
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,760
You blame me for being ruthless.

168
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,290
Don't you think it's funny?

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,400
Dear.

170
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,120
It's Du Li Li.

171
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
She seduced me.

172
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,200
I promise I won't contact her again.

173
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Please give me another chance.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Darling, give me another chance.

175
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,320
I don't want to see you.

176
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
Then I'll kneel down.

177
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
Honey, I beg you.

178
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,920
Give me one last chance.

179
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
Let go!

180
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,880
I can't.

181
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
Guards!

182
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,680
Drive him out.

183
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,450
Let's see who dares to ignore the vice president.

184
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,360
Honey, don't do this.

185
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,080
You can fire me.

186
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,800
but you can't divorce me.

187
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,120
No way!

188
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you okay?

189
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm fine.

190
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,160
Thank you.

191
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,880
It's okay.

192
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,920
As Mr. Lin's secretary,

193
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,280
as Mr. Lin's secretary.

194
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,600
You're fired.

195
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
Who are you to fire me?

196
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,920
Just wait.

197
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,200
I forgot to tell you.

198
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
your lover Jin Qiang was fired.

199
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,520
You can go to him now.

200
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
Su Xiaomeng, you slut!

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
If you can't seduce Director Jin,

202
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,160
you'll harm him instead.

203
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
It's really fresh

204
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,200
from a mistress.

205
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,340
Let me tell you.

206
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
I really don't like Jin Qiang.

207
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,600
You two can be companions.

208
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,120
He hit me!

209
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,600
Is there anyone in charge?

210
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
That was a great show.

211
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
The rumor is true.

212
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,400
Du Li Li and Director Jin really have an affair.

213
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,680
No wonder both of them are fired.

214
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,560
The mistress deserves it.

215
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,920
She's wronged.

216
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
Who are you acting for?

217
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,320
You and you.

218
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,680
Just you wait.

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,520
It's your fault.

220
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,200
Why are you blaming me?

221
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,200
If you hadn't insisted on pursuing excitement,

222
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,320
we wouldn't have been secretly photographed.

223
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
Stop talking nonsense.

224
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,560
Let me tell you.

225
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm annoyed now.

226
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
If you say one more word,

227
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,200
Get lost!

228
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
How dare you yell at me now?

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,330
You have no conscience.

230
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,690
You have no conscience.

231
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,620
I'll beat you to death! I'll kill you!

232
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm telling you.

233
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,280
I won't accept this now.

234
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,200
Du Li Li,

235
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,520
you can leave now.

236
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,760
Don't get in my way.

237
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,200
Let's go.

238
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,920
I was wrong, okay?

239
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,480
I was wrong.

240
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,760
We are in the same boat now.

241
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,400
You can't abandon me.

242
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Don't worry.

243
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
We still have a chance.

244
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,400
What's your plan?

245
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,360
Actor table.
