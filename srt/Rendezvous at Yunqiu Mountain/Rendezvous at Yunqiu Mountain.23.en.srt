1
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,580
You're insane!

2
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,759
If you want to die, die alone.

3
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,880
I don't want to fucking die.

4
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,400
If I die, you're not living either.

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,370
Let's go.

6
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,980
That message you sent me earlier.

7
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,120
What do you mean?

8
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,360
I said I can't stay at your place recently.

9
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
It means exactly what I said.

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
Are you trying to get rid of me as a burden?

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Can you stop overthinking everything?

12
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,000
Your 'important business' is meeting female servers.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,520
Having candlelight dinners with your wife.

14
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,079
I need to please her now

15
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,560
so she'll let her guard down.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
Then when we achieve our goal,

17
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
will you dump her?

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
Of course I will.

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,760
Then we can openly

20
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,320
enjoy our life together.

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,520
You heartless man!

22
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,380
Let me tell you,

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't live like this.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,240
Du Lili is at a critical moment now.

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,320
If you keep making trouble,

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,480
our relationship will be exposed.

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,960
I won't be able to protect you then.

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,360
You're the only one in my heart.

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,160
Then you're not allowed to date your wife anymore.

30
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,560
I swear.

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
You played this move so cleverly.

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,320
In this chess game,

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm the only player.

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,120
Everyone else is just a chess piece.

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,600
You heartless man.

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,010
You have no conscience.

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,400
I, Jin Qiang, won't fall for this.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,480
Du Lili.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,640
If you want to fight to the bitter end,

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,240
you can leave right now.

41
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,720
Ping'an, are you all okay?

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,500
Remember your wedding night,

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
when you told Lin Jing

44
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,740
that marrying her was your greatest joy in life?

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
Now I want to ask you,

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,810
do you regret marrying her?

47
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,520
How do you know all this?

48
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,080
Did she tell you?

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,920
Let me give you one last piece of news.

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,160
Your shares in Lüye Group

51
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,960
have all been confiscated.

52
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,290
The Jin family's business chain has been broken.

53
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
Bankruptcy is imminent.

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
I should have

55
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,640
strangled you back then.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,760
Everything is over now.

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
Let's go.

58
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,840
Let's go.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,659
Does it still hurt?

60
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,650
It's just a minor wound.

61
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Nothing serious.

62
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,820
Jin Qiang schemed everything

63
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
but ended up losing everything.

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
The same goes for Du Lili.

65
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,280
The law will give them the punishment they deserve.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,160
Jin Qiang has reached this point

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,400
with no way to turn back.

68
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,600
From now on,

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
whatever he does

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,040
has nothing to do with you anymore.

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Mr. Lin.

72
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
What should we do?

73
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,840
Let's get out of here quickly.

74
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Mr. Lin

75
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm glad it's nothing serious.

76
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
You have no idea

77
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,200
how worried I was.

78
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,680
Don't worry.

79
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,520
I made a wish in front of that ice pillar.

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,360
We haven't switched back yet.

81
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,160
How could anything happen to me?

82
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,400
Mr. Lin

83
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,560
the case of Du Lili hiring Li Zhuo to commit murder

84
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,320
has been thoroughly investigated.

85
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,780
They will all receive their due punishment.

86
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,280
Jin Qiang is now charged with kidnapping and extortion.

87
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Plus his marital infidelity,

88
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,640
we're officially divorced.

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm finally free.

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,900
That's wonderful.

91
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,400
Xiaomeng.

92
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,159
Xiaomeng, my dear daughter.

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Your father was beaten up.

94
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,760
He's bedridden

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,280
and I need to take care of him.

96
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,440
We have no income now

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,080
and we're in debt.

98
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,520
Your brother is getting married... Enough!

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
You still haven't realized

100
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,760
your mistakes.

101
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,400
You're just using this method

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,120
to gain sympathy from others.

103
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,760
Yes, I know I was wrong.

104
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,040
Just say I was wrong.

105
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,680
Please take pity on your brother.

106
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Stop pretending.

107
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,040
Su Xiaodong is

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,920
a perfectly healthy grown man

109
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,760
who never goes out to work

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,760
and just leeches off his parents and sister.

111
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
Your situation today

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,360
is entirely self-inflicted.

113
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,420
Move aside.

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,360
Xiaomeng!

115
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
What sin have I committed?

116
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
Won't you take pity on your brother?

117
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,760
What have I done to deserve this?

118
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,480
You're an ungrateful child.

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
Around 2 p.m. today

120
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,920
parts of Shanxi Province, China

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
will once again be able to observe

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,760
a total solar eclipse.

123
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
Having this phenomenon occur

124
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,680
in the same location within a year

125
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,600
is truly a once-in-a-century event.

126
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,280
Are you sure about this?

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
Sure about what?

128
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,320
What if

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,000
we can't switch back?

130
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
We've been through so much together.

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Even if we can't switch back,

132
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,360
it's not such a big deal.

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,600
I'll just spend my life

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,080
as carefree Su Xiaomeng.

135
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,200
That's fine with me.

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,040
Then I'll be

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,240
a brave and confident Lin Jing for life.

138
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,090
No matter what happens,

139
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,810
we'll face it together.

140
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,160
Okay.

141
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,520
I used to be afraid of my past.

142
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,720
Those memories of being treated with indifference

143
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
imprisoned me like shackles,

144
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
making me feel

145
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
that I wasn't good enough.

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,540
Not worthy of being loved.

147
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,800
Lin Jing,

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,520
when we first switched bodies,

149
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,410
I was really panicking.

150
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,970
I didn't know if I could handle it well.

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,760
But later I realized

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,000
that being able to control my own life

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
is something that gives a great sense of achievement.

154
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,920
I finally discovered that

155
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,080
I, Su Xiaomeng,

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
What I want most is confidence,

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,160
the courage to face life.

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Xiaomeng.

159
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,560
When I first became you,

160
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,540
I felt uncomfortable too.

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
You have too many people around you.

162
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,760
The noisy social interactions

163
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,240
made me feel exhausted.

164
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
I once thought

165
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,720
that relationships between people

166
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,240
were all meaningless.

167
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,840
I thought hiding in a thick shell

168
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
would protect me from getting hurt.

169
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,800
But in your body,

170
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,400
I experienced

171
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,720
what it means to actively express love.

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,450
To give love.

173
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
I realize now

174
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,240
trusting others

175
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,400
isn't such a scary thing after all.

176
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,480
What I want is to break out of this shell,

177
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,320
to love life again,

178
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,360
to bravely trust others.

179
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,160
Thank you,

180
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,200
Xiaomeng.

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Thank you,

182
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,920
Lin Jing.
