1
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,039
Lin Jing, why is Lin Jing here?

2
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,920
Hurry up.

3
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,640
Honey.

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,730
Honey, why are you sitting in the back seat today?

5
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,680
I put my bag in the back.

6
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,480
Why is the side door open?

7
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,240
Is it open?

8
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,200
Honey.

9
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
What brings you here?

10
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,400
I was just passing by.

11
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,680
I have something to do.

12
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm leaving.

13
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Okay. Okay.

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
Okay.

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,640
You'll catch a cold.

16
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,640
Thank you.

17
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,840
Let's go. Let's go.

18
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Let's go.

19
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Honey, I'll wait for you at home.

20
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
Lin Jing.

21
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
The humiliation I suffered

22
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
the humiliation I suffered.

23
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,760
Mr. Lin, the annual cocktail party of Ono Group

24
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
will begin soon.

25
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,040
There will be many foreign wine enterprises

26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,680
and industry media.

27
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,480
So, Mr. Lin, you need to give a speech.

28
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
Speech?

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,920
What should I do? I've never given a speech before.

30
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,960
This is bad.

31
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,040
In order to take care of foreign enterprises,

32
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,480
Mr. Lin, you need an English speech.

33
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,040
Mr. Lin, you graduated from a famous American university.

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,840
This is not a problem for you.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
It's a big problem.

36
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,040
Mr. Lin.

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,960
Any questions?

38
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
No problem.

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,800
Okay.

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,160
These are some information I collected.

41
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,560
It may help

42
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,480
for your English speech.

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,640
Please take a look.

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Thank you.

45
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
If there's nothing else,

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,120
I'll go out now.

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
Hello, Mr. Lin.

48
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,800
We need to meet up.

49
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,520
They want me to give an English speech

50
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,000
in English.

51
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,840
I can only say OK.

52
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Help me!

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,020
Somebody help me Somebody help me

54
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,840
Put your work down.

55
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,840
Hello, Mr Lin.

56
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Xiao Meng, you're here too.

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
Great. We can work together again.

58
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,159
Let me introduce.

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,840
This is Su Xiaomeng.

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,440
My new secretary.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,840
Alright, since you know each other,

62
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,170
don't just stand there.

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,400
I mean,

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Since we know each other,

65
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,840
I look forward to working with you.

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
I'll buy you coffee.

67
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,520
Welcome.

68
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Welcome Xiao Meng

69
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,640
Thank you.

70
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,640
Okay.

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,640
Let's go. Okay.

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,600
Go ahead.

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,480
Su Xiaomeng's parents came to the company last time.

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,540
Lin Jing appeared in the parking lot.

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,960
I'm worried

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,800
they might have found out about us.

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,090
That's why we need to hurry up the plan to transfer the property.

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,640
What's your plan?

79
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
I secretly registered a subsidiary

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,159
and found a small workshop

81
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,480
to provide them wine.

82
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
I'll ask Ono Group

83
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
to purchase at a high price.

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,040
So I don't have to pay any cost.

85
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
without any cost.

86
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,920
What if the Purchase Department betrays you?

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,940
I've already arranged it.

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,120
You're amazing, honey.

89
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
Then you can

90
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,800
into your wallet.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,160
The new order has been received.

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,040
Honey, you're amazing.

93
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
You're awesome.

94
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,440
I love you so much.

95
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,240
Right?

96
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,040
Pure content: 750 mm.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
Pure content: 750 mm.

98
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,770
I'm here, honey.

99
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,160
Hello, everyone.

100
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,600
Welcome to the annual party

101
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,920
the annual cocktail party.

102
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Next, let's welcome Lin Jing, president of Ono Group,

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,380
Mr. Lin will give a speech.

104
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,840
Hello, Mr. Lin.

105
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Before we received the news,

106
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Ono Group

107
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,600
in America.

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,919
There are quality problems.

109
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,440
It's the bacteria.

110
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Many consumers were hospitalized.

111
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
What do you think about this?

112
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,240
The wine you mentioned

113
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
is made by a pure company.

114
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
We found a quality problem.

115
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,640
It was our oversight.

116
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,400
Who leaked it to the media?

117
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,640
I don't know.

118
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,170
What's going on?

119
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,040
How did they get the news so soon?

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
As the president of Ono Group,

121
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
I hereby announce

122
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,920
our group

123
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,980
will terminate all cooperation related to the purity.

124
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,680
Lastly,

125
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,480
I apologize to the public on behalf of the group.

126
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,840
I secretly registered a subsidiary

127
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,160
and found a small workshop.

128
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,760
to supply wine.

129
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,920
and then let Ono Group

130
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,920
at a high price beyond the market price.

131
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,840
Then I won't use any cost.

132
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,800
Jin Qiang has gone too far.

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,840
For embezzlement of the group's property,

134
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,600
for embezzlement.

135
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I'm glad that he can't wait.

136
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,840
What's your plan?

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,160
Since Jin Qiang found a small workshop,

138
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
there must be a quality problem.

139
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Ask your men to check

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
the whereabouts of this small workshop.

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,960
to see if there's any aftersales problem.

142
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,240
If there is,

143
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,840
tell the reporters.

144
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,170
I'll ask them to expose it at the party.

145
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,040
Mr. Lin, you're so smart.

146
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,100
I'll send someone to investigate it.

147
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Hello, everyone.

148
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Hello, everyone.

149
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm the vice president of Ono Group, Jin Qiang.

150
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
You may not know.

151
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
Pure company

152
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,840
the reputation in the industry has always been good.

153
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,640
I believe this is a misunderstanding.

154
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,440
When we find out the truth,

155
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,160
we will give you a reasonable explanation.

156
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,360
Mr. Jin,

157
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,840
I’ve investigated it thoroughly.

158
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
The evidence is solid.

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,970
is the responsibility of the company.

160
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,680
I have a question.

161
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
As a small company

162
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,400
a new company.

163
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,360
It has a good reputation.

164
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,490
How did you get this kind of publicity?

165
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,760
As a newly established small company,

166
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,480
we can get orders from a big group like Ono.

167
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,960
I think

168
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,680
there must be something related to the transportation.

169
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,640
Don’t worry.

170
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
I will investigate it.

171
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,880
and get rid of

172
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,600
of the group.

173
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,060
Mr. Jin. What do you think?

174
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
What do you think?

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,040
You were overreacting just now.

176
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,000
Did you produce the fake wine?

177
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,760
Mr. Lin likes to joke with me.

178
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,300
What does it have to do with me?

179
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,840
I'm doing this for the company, right?

180
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,240
This woman...

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
She ruined such a good thing.

182
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Xiao Meng

183
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
So happy.

184
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,560
Of course.

185
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,640
We’re going to promote

186
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
at the wine party.

187
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,040
OK.

188
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,640
Let's welcome Lu Xiao.

189
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
to introduce

190
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,480
the new wine of Rong Zi Restaurant.

191
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,400
The new brand of wine

192
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,120

What are you doing today?

Why didn't you discuss

199
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840

Director Jin, please respect Mr. Lin.
