1
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,050
Be careful. Be careful.

2
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,640
Please respect Mr. Lin.

3
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,930
Who do you think you are?

4
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,480
If you forget,

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,600
I can remind you

6
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm Lin Jing's lawful husband.

7
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
The only legal husband.

8
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
What are you?

9
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
You're a dog of our family.

10
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,720
Some people don't have the ability to improve the group.

11
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,200
but you have the time to spit shit here.

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Who are you?

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,800
You're making a scene here.

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Watch your mouth.

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
She's my secretary. Shut up!

16
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,320
Honey, I'm not talking about you.

17
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,200
You really don't know how to recognize people.

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
Who is she?

19
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
She's a hotel waitress.

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,760
Let her be your personal secretary.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,480
You...

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,740
People will laugh at you if you tell them.

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Our Ono Group will lose face.

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,220
Do you know what you're doing?

25
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,680
This is called taking work as a joke.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,160
I was a waitress.

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,720
Mr. Jin,

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,960
As the vice president of the group,

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,000
he didn't find anything wrong with his alcohol.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,560
The company suffered such a huge loss.

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,720
I think

32
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,800
Mr. Jin should pay for this.

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,760
Am I right, Mr. Lin?

34
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes.

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,680
You should be responsible for this.

36
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,760
Honey.

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
Now you've learned

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,200
to help outsiders to deal with me.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Jin Qiang.

40
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,320
Who is the traitor?

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
I think you and I

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
better than anyone.

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,760
If this is your attitude,

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,880
let's not talk today.

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,460
As long as you don't regret it.

46
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,000
Hello.

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,640
Director Jin.

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,079
I have something you left at the hostel.

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,320
If Mr. Lin finds out,

50
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,720
you'll be in big trouble.

51
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,040
See you at the cafe tonight.

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
See you.

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
What is it?

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,320
Hello?

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Hello?

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You asked me out?

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,880
Why? Can't I meet Director Jin?

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,360
No.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,000
You asked me out?

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,860
Why are you acting so mysterious?

61
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
You have a purpose.

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,320
Director Jin.

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
I haven't said anything yet.

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,080
Why are you so wary of me?

65
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
Is it necessary?

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,640
Let me hear

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,000
what you can say today.

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,000
Actually, I'm here today

70
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,560
to negotiate with you.

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
A secretary is negotiating with me.

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Do I have a bargaining chip?

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,360
if I have a bargaining chip.

74
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,480
I used to be a waiter at the hostel.

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,400
When I was cleaning the room,

76
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,960
when cleaning the room.

77
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,360
I can tell from the fingerprints on it.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Whose is it?

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,520
What do you want?

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,880
I haven't given it to Mr. Lin yet.

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,280
I just want to make a deal with Director Jin.

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,740
Just tell me what you want.

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,320
Actually, I've admired you for a long time.

84
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,200
I also admire your courage.

85
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,360
As Mr. Lin's secretary,

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,160
compared to Mr. Jin's girlfriend,

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
and Mr. Lin better.

88
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,080
If you cooperate with me,

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
and let me replace Du Li Li,

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,000
I can make Director Jin gain more.

91
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,680
I can also get a lot of benefits.

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,800
Right?

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
What if I disagree?

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,760
If Mr. Lin knows your real plot,

95
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,800
he will make sure you leave the house with nothing.

96
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,520
Then you'll lose both your money and money.

97
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,080
You and Lin Jing are so close.

98
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,000
Your parents came to me before.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
You know that, right?

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,159
Then tell me.

101
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,880
Why should I believe you?

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Mr. Jin is really something.

103
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
You're so thoughtful.

104
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
So I specially prepared a gift

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,760
for Mr. Jin.

106
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,400
Director Jin, I'm sorry.

107
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,360
Sorry.

108
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
It's our fault.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,530
You still know to come back?

110
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you having a hard time?

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,520
Is the wine business

112
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
is not as popular as before.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
If I want to live well,

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,200
I need your help.

115
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,800
We?

116
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
We're from a small family.

117
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
We can't help you.

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,280
That's right.

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,800
For the sake of money,

120
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,360
for the sake of money.

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,480
Xiao Meng.

122
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,000
What are you doing? We're not strangers.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,560
You...

124
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,880
Why are you doing this?

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Tell us if you need anything.

126
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,880
Go ahead.

127
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,800
Help me?

128
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,800
It's simple.

129
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,920
Take a video.

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Take a video.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Honey.

132
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Take a video.

133
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,440
It's simple.

134
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I'll take it then.

135
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,320
It's quite heavy.

136
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,640
Okay.

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,720
I agree.

138
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Mom agreed.

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
I knew it.

140
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,520
I came with a gift.

141
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Working together

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,170
I have to show my sincerity.

143
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,010
You're the one who worked hard.

144
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,360
to get this video.

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
But I have to tell you.

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,680
Lin Jing has been cold to me lately.

147
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,280
She's also wary of me.

148
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200
I think

149
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,760
to believe this video.

150
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
Don't worry, Mr Jin.

151
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,400
Although Mr. Lin is suspicious of you,

152
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,280
but there is no solid evidence.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
Since she knew your relationship with Du,

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,260
but she didn't expose you.

155
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,320
Now is the critical moment.

156
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,960
As long as you perform well,

157
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,040
Mr. Lin

158
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,240
will give you another chance.

159
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
You mean...

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,130
Mr. Lin will believe you

161
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,160
Mr. Lin will believe you.

162
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,760
Only then can you protect yourself.

163
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,360
and transfer your property.

164
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,560
I knew it.

165
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,480
I

166
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,400
I've been thinking about you.

167
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,179
What's that saying again?

168
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,610
"If you're sincere, it works."

169
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
I didn't expect you to help me

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,960
God sent you to help me.

171
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Don't miss me, Director Jin.

172
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
After all, we can't miss the opportunity.

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
Am I right?

174
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
You're right.

175
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,320
It's a pity that

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,280
I didn't get to know you sooner.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,200
Otherwise,

178
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,200
how could I respect Du Li Li?

179
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,360
Compared to you,

180
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,320
She's nothing.

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
You're not answering your phone?

182
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,080
It's just some unimportant people.

183
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
It's okay.

184
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,560
Excuse me.

185
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,260
I need to use the bathroom.

186
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,320
The fish took the bait.

187
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,180
I persuaded Jin Qiang as planned.

188
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
You can meet him now.

189
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay.

190
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,960
Leave the rest to me.

191
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
Okay, be careful.

192
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,200
Honey.

193
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
We haven't talked for a long time.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,280
Do you remember today is our love day?

195
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
Tonight?

196
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,400
at Tianhua Restaurant tonight.

197
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Shall we have a candlelight dinner?

198
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,200
Sure enough.

199
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,480
Cold war is temporary.

200
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
You have to beg me.

201
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,360
Woman.

202
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
Is something good going on, Director Jin?

203
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,400
Of course.

204
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
By the way, Xiao Meng,

205
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,960
I wanted to ask you out for dinner.

206
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,600
But I just got a message from the company.

207
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
I have a dinner party tonight.

208
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,960
Let's meet another day.

209
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,560
Okay, no problem.

210
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,930
Let's go.

211
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,120
Mr. Jin, you're in a hurry.

212
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,720
I really don't want to leave.

213
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,560
Girl, we have plenty of opportunities to meet.

214
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,240
You bastard!

215
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
You're eating and thinking about the pot.

216
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,320
Let's go.

217
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,080
He didn't answer my call.

218
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,080
Is it because of Lin Jing?

219
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,200
The person you're looking for

220
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
is at Happan Cafe.

221
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,920
Meet cafe

222
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,560
Wow!

223
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,160
Honey.

224
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,600
You look so beautiful today.
