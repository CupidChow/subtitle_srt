1
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,100
Something is wrong with the dish.

2
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,479
Xiao Meng, what's wrong?

3
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,240
Are you tired?

4
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
Let me help you to rest.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,960
I'll go to the bathroom myself.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,040
Don't touch me!

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
What did you do to me?

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,520
We...

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,360
Xiaomeng

10
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Listen to me.

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,290
We're doing this for your own good.

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,640
Let me help you get some rest.

13
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,440
Don't help me.

14
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,640
Be good.

15
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
What if you fall down?

16
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,000
Should we force her like this?

17
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,440
After all, we raised her up.

18
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
What do you know?

19
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,960
She's used to being free these years.

20
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,200
But marriage and marriage

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
to get married.

22
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,800
For our Su family,

23
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,680
and that unborn grandson,

24
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,280
for the unborn grandson.

25
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,920
Mr. Lin.

26
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
This contract

27
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,170
with this contract, right?

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,440
Xiao Meng has signed the contract.

29
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,760
She must have read the contract.

30
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,420
Mr. Lin.

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,720
At 8 p.m.,

32
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
at 8 p.m. later.

33
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,570
She's always cautious.

34
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,440
No problem.

35
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,040
You're mine today.

36
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Don't be afraid.

37
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,800
I'll be good to you.

38
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Who are you?

39
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
What are you doing?

40
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,480
Rape and kidnapping.

41
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
You'll be sentenced to ten years.

42
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
Nonsense! I paid the betrothal gifts.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
She is my wife.

44
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,540
I can do whatever I want. Stop.

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,520
Stop it.

46
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
Stop!

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,970
Get out! Get out!

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,040
Wait for me. It's not over.

49
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,000
Xiaomeng, can you hear me?

50
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,640
Xiaomeng

51
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,640
Are you okay?

52
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,640
Hello? Hello?

53
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,240
You...

54
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,760
Wake up.

55
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,080
It’s hot. It’s hot.

56
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Hello. Hello.

57
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,600
You're awake.

58
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,440
Have some water.

59
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

60
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
Don't worry.

61
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,810
I found Mrs. Li to change it for you last night.

62
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,600
Thank you.

63
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,280
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

64
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,280
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

65
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,440
I didn't know

66
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,000
could be so despicable.

67
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,840
It's okay. It's not your fault.

68
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,440
But I will make them pay.

69
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,220
Whether it's Li Zhuo or the Su family,

70
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,360
who hurt you

71
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,880
or try to hurt you,

72
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
can't escape.

73
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,360
You've always been

74
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,610
you've always been my dependence.

75
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,480
No matter in work or life,

76
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,700
you are like a pill of calming my mind.

77
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Let me know

78
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
As long as you're here

79
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,900
I don't have to worry about anything.

80
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
But this time,

81
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,160
Let me protect you

82
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Xiao Meng. Come on.

83
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,600
Mr. Lin.

84
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,480
You're not fighting alone. You're fighting alone.

85
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
You have me.

86
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,880
I won't let you face this alone.

87
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
I know.

88
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,200
you are no longer

89
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,650
the coward Su Xiaomeng.

90
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,280
You are

91
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
has changed.

92
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,160
I've brought the betrothal gifts.

93
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,600
Honey, are you happy now?

94
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
I got the money,

95
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,640
But I'm interested in a car.

96
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,160
The down payment is 150,000 won.

97
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,560
What are you going to do?

98
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,240
You said you'd give me enough betrothal gifts.

99
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,400
Why are you buying a car now?

100
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,280
We have to walk every day without a car.

101
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,440
So embarrassing.

102
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,280
I don't have that much money now.

103
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,880
I spent all my money on your betrothal gift.

104
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,640
Isn't your sister the boss's best friend?

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,480
Lend me some more.

106
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,680
If you can't even handle this,

107
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
how will we live in the future?

108
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,800
You...

109
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
What?

110
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,840
I'm with you

111
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,080
for the betrothal gifts.

112
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,560
If not, I'll agree to it.

113
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I agree.

114
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,480
Let me tell you. Let's break up.

115
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,760
You either break up

116
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,240
You can buy a car.

117
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,520
Hello, brother-in-law.

118
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,480
How dare you call me brother-in-law?

119
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,040
Now!

120
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,680
Return the betrothal money now.

121
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,440
Sister, brother-in-law.

122
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,680
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

123
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll talk to my sister.

124
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,000
I've used up the betrothal gifts.

125
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,840
Just wait.

126
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,240
I have 10,000 ways to make you regret.

127
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,500
Hey, brother-in-law.

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,960
Let me tell you. Let's go. Let's go. Okay.

129
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,040
How about buying a car?

130
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,840
or we don't see each other again.

131
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,440
Okay, son, have a sip.

132
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,440
There's nothing

133
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
to return the betrothal gifts.

134
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,400
No matter how difficult Li Zhuo is,

135
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,440
he has no right to trouble us.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
Your mother is right.

137
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,600
The betrothal gifts are given according to the rules.

138
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,880
You can't just cancel it.

139
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,280
That's true.

140
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,600
But Li Zhuo

141
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
I heard that he has a tough wrist.

142
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,040
If he really comes,

143
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,480
Can we handle it?

144
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
Alright, son.

145
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
After all,

146
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Su Xiaomeng is suspicious.

147
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,970
She doesn't want to.

148
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
Let him go to Su Xiaomeng.

149
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,960
It has nothing to do with us.

150
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,200
That makes sense.

151
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,800
Let them

152
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,240
Let them handle it themselves.

153
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Alright, son.

154
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,360
I'll go play mahjong.

155
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,690
I'm going to play games.

156
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Su Xiao Dong, listen.

157
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,880
[The last day.]

158
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,280
Pay me back.

159
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,260
don't blame me for being rude.

160
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,480
Mr. Lin, why are you here?

161
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,880
What do you mean?

162
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Su Xiaomeng is my secretary.

163
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
If you bully her,

164
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,720
is bullying me.

165
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,040
Mr. Lin, you misunderstood.

166
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Xiao Meng is my legal wife.

167
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,130
I gave her the betrothal gifts.

168
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,680
Marriage for sale.

169
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,760
How dare you say that?

170
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,400
Do you think you can buy someone

171
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,760
can buy one person?

172
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,760
Let me tell you.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,640
This is illegal marriage transaction.

174
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,040
You've violated the law.

175
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
We have a lot of

176
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,440
your criminal evidence.

177
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,400
It's enough for you to be sentenced for many years.

178
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,440
Mr. Lin.

179
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

180
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Besides,

181
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,160
It wasn't my idea.

182
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,480
It was my idea. It was my idea.
