1
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
Let's go.

2
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
What brings you here?

3
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,360
Su Xiaomeng.

4
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
I want to talk to you.

5
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,160
You're not welcome here.

6
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,160
Mr. Lu.

7
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,200
Xiaoping was bullied by her classmates.

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,130
The class teacher wants to see you.

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
Don't worry. I'm fine.

10
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,200
Go ahead.

11
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,640
Tell me, what's the matter?

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,960
Su Xiaomeng,

13
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
You set me up so miserably.

14
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,640
Are you here for revenge?

15
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,400
It doesn't sound like you.

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,200
Of course not.

17
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,079
I like that kind of person.

18
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,160
smart

19
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,650
She's a cruel woman.

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
I'm thinking

21
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
if we work together,

22
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,370
we'll definitely achieve something big.

23
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,720
What do you think?

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Tell me.

25
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,720
I'm thinking

26
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,760
I want you to be my lover

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,240
and help me get Lin Jing's property.

28
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Of course.

29
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,720
I can sign the agreement.

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,360
I'll give you half after I get the property.

31
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,760
If you want to break up,

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
it's better than

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
than working for Lin Jing.

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
you earn a lot.

35
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Your conditions are indeed attractive.

36
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,000
Let me think about it.

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,040
This is my number.

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,160
Call me when you think it over.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,480
I'll wait for you.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Linlin, Linlin, don't go.

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,040
What's wrong?

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
Will you give me the betrothal gifts I want?

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,480
Yes.

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,920
200,000 is too high.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,860
How about this?

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,650
100,000 won.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,440
150,000.

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Linlin.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,400
Good girl, please make an exception.

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
I really like you.

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,200
Please make an exception.

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm telling you.

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,839
Not even one point less.

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,160
Linlin, I beg you.

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,040
I've spent all my money for the betrothal gifts.

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,400
I can't take it out.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
I have no choice.

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,780
That's our family's request.

59
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,800
Let me tell you.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,160
200,000 betrothal gifts.

61
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,200
I won't get married if it's less.

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
Linlin,

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,520
For the sake of our child,

64
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,250
how dare you mention the child?

65
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,520
Let me tell you.

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
Give me 200,000 yuan in three days.

67
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,420
Or I'll go to the hospital and abort the baby.

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,840
By the way,

69
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,000
This is a boy.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,600
A boy.

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Boy.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,320
Linlin.

73
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,040
You're amazing.

74
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,720
Look, it's a family heirloom.

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
But this can't give birth.

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
It's bad for your health.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,760
Don't fight.

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,080
Yes.

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Miss, look.

80
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
Uncle and auntie.

81
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,760
are old now.

82
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,400
They are not in good health.

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
That's right.

84
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I want Xiao Dong to carry on the family line.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,560
so that we can have a grandson.

86
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,690
Please understand.

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Uncle.

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,400
Auntie.

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,200
I want to keep my child.

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,840
But my family doesn't allow it.

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,840
If you can't pay for the betrothal gifts,

92
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,100
what about my brother?

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,730
He's waiting for money to get married.

94
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,400
Linlin,

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,520
I'll beg my sister again.

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll beg her if she has money.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,440
You must keep the baby.

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,840
Linlin,

99
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,440
Give me two more days.

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
Go ahead.

101
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,920
Let's go.

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,800
It's you. What are you doing here?

103
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm here to give you money.

104
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,640
Your son is getting married.

105
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,520
You couldn't afford the betrothal gifts.

106
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
You mean

107
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
you want to give us money?

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
We have such a big problem.

109
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,400
You want to give us money?

110
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
What's your purpose?

111
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,360
Dad.

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
She must be fooling us.

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,960
That's all?

114
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
It’s not enough.

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,320
Miss Du,

116
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
Look.

117
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
We didn't recognize you before.

118
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,720
Sorry for offending you.

119
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
I apologize to you.

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,320
I only have one request.

121
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,800
Go ahead.

122
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,200
Find a way to make your daughter Su Xiaomeng

123
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,960
leave Ono Group.

124
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,440
This is just the deposit.

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,840
After this,

126
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,800
I'll pay

127
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,000
for your son.

128
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
I don't care.

129
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,400
Okay.

130
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,360
Okay, I'll do it for you.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,920
What is this? A family of three.

132
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,240
Give it back.

133
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,920
You drew the wrong one.

134
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,800
You don't have a mother.

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,560
You're a wild child.

136
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not a wild child.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Give me back my painting!

138
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Give it back!

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
How dare you bully Ping’an!

140
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,920
Come here.

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,960
I didn't.

142
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,800
You said you didn't.

143
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,640
Take me to your parents.

144
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
Sorry, I was wrong.

145
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
It's useless to tell me.

146
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,930
Tell Ping’an

147
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,760
Sorry.

148
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,120
Louder.

149
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,160
Look.

151
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
This is my mom.

152
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,760
Give me the painting.

153
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,520
I’m telling you.

154
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I won’t forgive you

155
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,650
I won’t forgive you.

156
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Let’s go home.

157
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,720
Xiaoping.

158
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,040
Are you upset?

159
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,080
No.

160
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,720
My dad said I'm a man.

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,320
Don't be spoiled.

162
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,000
Pretty lady.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,760
I like you so much.

164
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,000
Xiaoping, I like you too.

165
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,920
Let me tell you a secret.

166
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,000
My dad likes you too.

167
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,840
Safe.

168
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Dad.

169
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
What is this painting?

170
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Xiao Meng.

171
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,360
Let’s go.

172
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
Xiaoping.

173
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,640
This is my special hot wine.

174
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,360
Try it.

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,580
Drink slowly. The wine is strong.

176
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,600
I won't get drunk.

177
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,840
I hope so.

178
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,640
Everyone says I don't have a mom.

179
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
Dad.

180
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,520
I want beautiful lady to be my mom.

181
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,200
Xiaoping, don’t talk nonsense.

182
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
You...

183
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,120
Dad, someone bullied me again yesterday.

184
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,320
I'm a kid without a mother.

185
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,600
I really want a mom.

186
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
Can I call you beautiful aunties and moms?

187
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,160
Will you be angry?

188
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,200
Xiaoping.

189
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,440
Pretty lady.

190
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
They are...

191
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,440
They are my biological parents.

192
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,120
Then...

193
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,840
Lu Xiao is...

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
He's actually my uncle.

195
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,360
My biological parents

196
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,760
died in a car accident when I was young.

197
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Hira.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,520
If you want to call me mom,

199
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,200
you can call me secretly.

200
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,760
Really

201
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,560
Hush.

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,930
This is a little secret between us.

203
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Promise.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,120
Dad, beautiful lady will catch a cold.

205
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,000
Why don't you take her to bed?
