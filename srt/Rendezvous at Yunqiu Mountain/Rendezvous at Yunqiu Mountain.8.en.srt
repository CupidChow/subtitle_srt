1
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,560
Mr. Lin, this is the guest list of the party.

2
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,759
If there is any internal arrangement,

3
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,320
just leave it to Mr. Han.

4
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
If it's a big project,

5
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,720
just ask me.

6
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,280
Mr. Lin's activity inventory is not enough this month.

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll go first.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,080
My business is more important.

9
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,479
Me too.

10
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
Don't rush. Come one by one.

11
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
Mr. Han.

12
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Here's the thing.

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,760
Mr. Han will decide

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,160
is up to Mr. Han.

15
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,760
He represents me, Mr. Han.

16
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,280
This is a training for you.

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,800
Come on. I have to go.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,520
Mr. Lin.

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,000
Mr. Lin.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've taken care of the work just now.

21
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
There are some European documents here.

22
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,579
need you to take a look.

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,440
Please take a look.

24
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
I'll leave you alone.

25
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,160
Wait.

26
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
What else can I do for you?

27
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,080
You have to work anyway.

28
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,160
Why don't you work here?

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,760
Mr. Lin,

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,320
No way.

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,520
Why not?

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,560
Just sit.

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,880
and read this document.

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,160
Today, on behalf of me,

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Come on.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,720
Mr. Lin.

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,920
Xiaotao.

38
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,600
Mr. Lin.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,720
Are you used to your new job?

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,800
Yes.

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,480
Mr. Lin,

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
Thank you very much

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
to the headquarters.

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
You're welcome.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,160
You're reliable

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
and potential.

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,000
So I transferred you here.

48
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,320
I just want to be closer to you.

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,680
Do your best.

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,560
Thank you, Mr Lin.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,520
Sure.

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,320
I'll leave you to it.

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
I won't hold you up.

54
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,960
Why is it so messy here?

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Don't you feel uncomfortable working here?

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

57
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
It's our fault.

58
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,160
We'll clean now.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
No need.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,420
Don't delay your work.

61
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,360
Let me do it.

62
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Mr. Lin, how can you do it yourself?

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,480
Let me do it.

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,720
I'll do it. Go on with your work.

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,159
What is it?

66
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,920
Mr. Lin.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,650
Please go to the meeting room to host the meeting.

68
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
No, you can go.

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,320
You host it.

70
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,880
Okay.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,080
What are you waiting for?

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,409
Let's go to the meeting.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
It's easier to clean up.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
Why didn't you knock?

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
You scared me.

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,440
You're dressed formally today

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,000
You're wearing perfume

78
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,480
And flowers

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,000
It's not for me.

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
Are you going to please that bitch Lin Jing?

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,360
So what?

82
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,440
We have to take action now.

83
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,159
I'm trying to please her

84
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,000
to lower her guard.

85
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,240
and let her down?

86
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,320
I think you just want to stay at home.

87
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
The flags are floating outside.

88
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,360
Look at you.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,520
I usually give you a lot of things.

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,160
Why are you upset?

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,120
Stop it.

92
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,560
Stop it.

93
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,440
By the way,

94
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Lin Jing has been in the company recently.

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
Don't make it too public.

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,520
in case she gets suspicious.

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
Honey, you...

98
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,000
Why are you cleaning?

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,080
Let them do it.

100
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
It's uncomfortable to sit too long.

101
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,320
Get up and exercise.

102
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,960
What brings you here?

103
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,159
Honey.

104
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,400
Do you remember what day it is today?

105
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,760
Oh no. Mr. Lin didn't tell me.

106
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,880
What day is it?

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,320
Today is our wedding anniversary.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,160
How do I look?

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,540
Does it look familiar?

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,320
When we got married,

111
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,450
when we got married.

112
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,000
And

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,660
this is your favorite flower.

114
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
I also sprayed your favorite perfume.

115
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,920
Smell it.

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,980
What are you spraying?

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,480
Don't come so close to me.

118
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Honey, what's wrong?

119
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
Are you sick?

120
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,480
Stay away from me.

121
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,240
Honey.

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,900
What's wrong with you lately?

123
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,400
Nothing.

124
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I just don't like your perfume.

125
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,090
But this is your favorite perfume.

126
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,159
I don't like it anymore.

127
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,480
Honey.

128
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,560
I think we should talk.

129
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,280
I don't want to talk to you.

130
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,800
Mr. Jin, I have something to report to Mr. Lin.

131
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,920
Why are you everywhere?

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,960
Let me tell you.

133
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,880
you are a dog of our company.

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,960
Excuse me.

135
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,920
Sir,

136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,159
You used

137
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,920
in your room.

138
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,920
Please pay at the reception.

139
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,480
Who do you think you are?

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
You're just a dog.

141
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,580
You want to stop me?

142
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,560
This is free, right?

143
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,200
Yes.

144
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Get out of the way!

145
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,200
Jin Qiang.

146
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,000
Have you forgotten that

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
that you used to be an ordinary employee?

148
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
You became the vice president

149
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
because you married me.

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,760
Who are you to insult my assistant?

151
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,520
Honey, I...

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
How can you speak for an outsider?

153
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,000
Leave.

154
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Xiaoping, what are you drawing?

155
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,560
Armored Warrior.

156
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,890
Armor warrior doesn't look like this.

157
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
Let me help you.

158
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,560
Not this color.

159
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
It's this color.

160
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,360
Here.

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,200
Let me teach you.

162
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,160
Aunt Su, why are you so good at drawing?

163
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,600
When I was young,

164
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,080
I studied flat design.

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,960
I wanted to be a designer.

166
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,940
but now I can only give up my dream.

167
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,760
Xiaoping.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,120
Dad.

169
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,720
Miss Su.

170
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
I made dinner.

171
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,410
Let's eat together.

172
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
No need.

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
I'm here to discuss

174
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,400
with you.

175
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,680
Don't think about work.

176
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,080
Let's eat first.

177
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,240
Aunt Su, let's go.

178
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
What is this?

179
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,240
Why did you burn a pot of eggs?

180
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,100
Don't touch it.

181
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Luckily it's not a light fire.

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,080
Drink some water first.

183
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,280
Apply the ointment later.

184
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,800
Don't be nervous.

185
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
Why did you burn a pot of eggs?

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is a special snack, stone cake.

187
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
It's used in the pot

188
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
in the pot.

189
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,280
Why didn't you tell me

190
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,000
such a dangerous thing?

191
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,800
If you were my employee,

192
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,160
I would have deducted your bonus.

193
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Do you like business so much?

194
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,280
Of course.

195
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,440
There must be a goal in life.

196
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,160
My goal

197
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
is to lead the company to the top 500.

198
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,520
Okay.

199
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,560
When you become the top 500,

200
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,360
I'll make a plaque here.

201
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,160
Please don't touch the pebbles in the pot.

202
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Otherwise, your hands will become roasted trotters.

203
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,000
That's a deal.

204
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Give me your hand.

205
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,240
Don't bother.

206
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,800
Don't move. It'll be done soon.

207
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,320
Thank you.

208
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,400
This is nothing

209
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,000
is nothing compared to before.

210
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,840
What?

211
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,560
You used to get hurt a lot.

212
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,360
Nothing.

213
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,560
Don't touch water recently.
