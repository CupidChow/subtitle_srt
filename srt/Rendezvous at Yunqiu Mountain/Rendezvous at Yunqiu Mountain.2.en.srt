1
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,880
This is the village head's house

2
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,680
It's the home style of the residents of Tarpo.

3
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
The Millennial Sue Snow in April.

4
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,640
Flowers blossom in a day.

5
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,480
Mr. Lin.

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,520
This is Yunqiu Mountain's special soda tea.

7
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,880
How is it, Mr. Lin?

8
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,960
It's good.

9
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Help! Help! Help!

10
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Help!

11
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,960
Mr. Lin, run!

12
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,240
What happened just now?

13
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Mr. Lin.

14
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Hello? Hello?

15
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Hello? Hello?

16
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,680
Mr. Lin.

17
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,280
Mr. Lin, can you find the way? Mr. Lin.

18
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,120
Su Xiaomeng.

19
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
Su Xiaomeng.

20
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
Su Xiaomeng?

21
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,680
Did Mr. Lin go out first?

22
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Is anyone there?

23
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,280
I lost Mr. Lin.

24
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm sure he'll scold me when I go back.

25
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,480
You might get fired.

26
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
Where is she?

27
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,280
This female employee is so unreliable.

28
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,200
Who will lead the way?

29
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,160
He even changed his clothes.

30
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,120
This is ridiculous.

31
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Hey.

32
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,320
Isn't this Mr. Lin's clothes?

33
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,120
Mr. Lin.

34
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Yes.

35
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,960
I finally found you.

36
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,200
Hey.

37
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,659
Why are you looking for me?

38
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Did you drink?

39
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
The car isn't here.

40
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,090
Let's go down first.

41
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,360
Help her down.

42
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,000
Hey!

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,560
Where are you taking me?

44
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Hey.

45
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
My car.

46
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,960
Han Ziming.

47
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,880
Hey.

48
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,280
Han Ziming.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Good for you, Han Ziming.

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,920
How dare you ignore me?

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It seems that

52
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,400
Where's my phone?

53
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,320
It can't unlock.

54
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,200
Hey.

55
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,400
Do you need help?

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,200
You're welcome.

57
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
It's hard to get a taxi here and no bus.

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
Are you lost?

59
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,520
Why are you being so nice?

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I told you I don't need it.

61
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Okay.

62
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
Wait.

63
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,800
Let's go to Kang Gapyeong Guesthouse.

64
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
I'll pay you when I get there.

65
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,760
Get in.

66
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Yes.

67
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,560
People like you

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,000
wouldn't like cheap water like this.

69
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Who said that?

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
Have a seat.

71
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,760
Is this for me?

72
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
Isn't this arranged by Mr. Lin?

73
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,840
to be Mr. Lin's guide.

74
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,440
Is there such treatment?

75
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,120
Here we are.

76
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,000
We're here.

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,760
Wait.

78
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,920
Give me your phone number.

79
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,880
I'll ask my assistant to transfer it to you.

80
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,480
No need.

81
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,200
I don't like owing people favors.

82
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,520
We agreed on tip.

83
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,120
Hey, I haven't finished yet.

84
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,280
Mr. Lin is so decent.

85
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
Time to go back to work.

86
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Su Xiaomeng.

87
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,360
Su Xiaomeng.

88
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,080
I think you've really rebelled.

89
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,000
You skipped work for no reason.

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
How dare you come here?

91
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,760
What?

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
What are you doing?

93
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,000
Look who I am.

94
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,840
Su Xiaomeng.

95
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,200
How dare you talk to me in this tone?

96
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
How dare you!

97
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,680
How dare you!

98
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,080
Not only did I dare,

99
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,320
I also dare to fire you.

100
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,919
From tomorrow onwards, you don't have to come.

101
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,679
Fire me. It's the opposite.

102
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,159
I smell your perfume.

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,159
Smell it.

104
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,880
Smell it, right?

105
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,799
Lin Jing is here.

106
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,800
Hurry up.

107
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Hide

108
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,360
Honey

109
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,960
Surprise

110
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,320
Sir.

111
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
You got the wrong person.

112
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,400
Do you miss me?

113
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,520
Give me a kiss.

114
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Rascal.

115
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,680
It's me, not Jing.

116
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,000
Why did you hit me?

117
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,600
Hey.

118
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,200
Hello.

119
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,280
Hello, Mr. Lin.

120
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,360
Mr. Lin.

121
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm really sorry.

122
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,840
Our waiter

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,040
left you there alone

124
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,160
and came back.

125
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
I'll fire her now.

126
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,810
What did you call me?

127
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Mr. Lin.

128
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,760
Mr. Lin.

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I envy you for being carefree.

130
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,640
If possible,

131
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,220
I really want to swap with you.

132
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,480
Gosh.

133
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,080
I became Mr. Lin. How could this happen?

134
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm Su Xiaomeng, who is in charge of reception.

135
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,400
If you have any questions,

136
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
I can give you a detailed introduction.

137
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,160
Isn't this the waiter just now?

138
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,440
How did I become her?

139
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
This is so unreal.

140
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Where is Mr. Lin?

141
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,480
Mr. Lin, let's make a wish together.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Make a wish?

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,460
I have to find the waiter quickly.

144
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,960
Excuse me.

145
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,920
Xiao Meng.

146
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
Give it to me.

147
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,120
Beauty.

148
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,120
You're so pretty.

149
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,560
to be a receptionist here?

150
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
Boss, do you need anything?

151
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
Can I have a drink with you?

152
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,000
Sorry, boss.

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,880
We don't provide this kind of service.

154
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,080
If you don't have anything important to do, please leave.

155
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Yes.

156
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,560
Get me a room. A big bed.

157
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,680
Why does he need a room?

158
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,200
A big bed.

159
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,960
Thank you.

160
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,680
Are you done?

161
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,280
Yes.

162
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,920
It's done.

163
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,080
Let's go. What are you looking at?

164
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
How rude.

165
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,360
Xiao Meng, your scarf.

166
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,160
Thank you.

167
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Have you noticed

168
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,210
Lin Jing is a little strange recently?

169
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,120
She doesn't seem to know me.

170
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
Nonsense.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Will she find out what I did?

172
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,720
Is she crazy?

173
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,380
Maybe she's just pretending.

174
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,800
Are we exposed?

175
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
It's okay.

176
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Lin Jing is just a romantic.

177
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,200
If I lie to her a little bit,

178
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
she'll fall in front of me.

179
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,760
She is just a dog I tamed.

180
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,000
When we achieve our goal,

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,680
will you kick her out?

182
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,200
Of course I will.

183
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,080
By then,

184
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
we can

185
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,120
and enjoy our life.

186
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,800
It's not too late to enjoy now.

187
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,130
No wonder Han Ja-myung couldn't find anyone in the company.

188
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,520
He was eating here.
