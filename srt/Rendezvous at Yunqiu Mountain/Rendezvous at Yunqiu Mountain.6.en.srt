1
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,360
She's my daughter. She's my daughter. She's my daughter.

2
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,560
Who is your daughter?

3
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,920
Please forgive me.

4
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,720
Yes.

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Is your daughter

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,120
the waiter

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,880
You're the waiter, right? Yes.

8
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,120
No, no.

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,520
We don't know who you are talking about.

10
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,770
Fine, you won't tell the truth, right?

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,640
Believe it or not,

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,000
I can sue you now.

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
malicious slander.

14
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,520
You assaulted my employee.

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,960
I asked you to compensate me for mental damage.

16
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm telling you, it's not a hundred thousand.

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
It won't be enough.

18
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm so sorry.

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,920
We're even now.

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,600
But I have one more request.

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,840
Get on your knees and apologize.

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,640
Miss Jin.

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,079
Miss Du, we are not young anymore.

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,480
Forget it.

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay.

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,040
Okay.

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
That's it.

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,040
Bow.

30
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,000
Show me your head.

31
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,720
All right.

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
Can we go now?

33
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
Listen.

34
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
Don't make trouble for us again.

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,480
Or I'll sue you anytime.

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,490
Get lost!

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Xiao Meng.

38
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Manager.

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
You're fired.

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,880
Don't you know your parents offended Vice President Jin?

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,410
It's okay, Manager.

42
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,360
But you have to compensate me for two months' salary.

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
Don't forget about it.

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,840
Are you crazy?

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,120
That's enough. Just stay here and watch.

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,640
Dad, Mom.

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,120
How dare you come back?

48
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,320
Why did you come back?

49
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,200
You embarrassed us both.

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,320
Dad, I didn't expect that scumbag to be so cruel.

51
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Mom and the others are too strong.

52
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,440
Looks like we can't afford to offend them.

53
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,040
I can't.

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,280
Don't mess with him.

55
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,360
You've made me and your dad miserable.

56
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,720
Because of what you did,

57
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,440
I lost my job too.

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,440
I have no money to pay you.

59
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,360
Mom, can you lend me 10,000 yuan to circulate?

60
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,520
I'll pay you back when I find a new job.

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,120
Go talk to your dad.

62
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,200
Shame on you!

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,640
I raised you up.

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,040
I don't need your reward.

65
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
but you still want to live off your parents.

66
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,920
Dad, just lend me 10,000 yuan.

67
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
I just want to make some circumstance.

68
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,880
I found a new job.

69
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Go away.

70
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,320
Mom.

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,080
Just lend me 10,000 won.

72
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Please.

73
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I'll pay you back when I find a new job.

74
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
Get lost if you don't have a job.

75
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
Get lost!

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,080
Go back to your room.

77
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,520
to see their true colors.

78
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,600
might be a good thing for you.

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,600
Just like how I saw that scumbag.

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,530
You can get rid of this family soon.

81
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Stop crying. Let's go.

82
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,680
Why are you here?

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,360
Honey.

84
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,040
Your lipstick color is nice.

85
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,680
Honey, why are you so early today?

86
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,720
Tell me next time.

87
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,640
I'll pick you up.

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,600
No, I have something else to do.

89
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,659
Don't get in my way.

90
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Who is that woman?

91
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,890
She's really being clingy.

92
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,360
Her parents came last week.

93
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,680
She's here again.

94
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,520
We can't let her get too close to Lin Jing.

95
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,480
Don't worry.

96
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,680
I'll teach her a lesson.

97
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,040
Those two are going too far.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,360
Mr. Lin.

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,680
Are you just going to leave him alone?

100
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Of course.

101
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,360
But not now.

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,280
One day,

103
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,000
I will make those who hurt me

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
pay the price.

105
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,880
Since no one is home,

106
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,120
I won't stand on ceremony.

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm exhausted.

108
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,320
Mom and Dad.

109
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,000
What's wrong, son?

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,320
Dad.

111
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,440
My tablet laptop was stolen.

112
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,600
What? Hurry up.

113
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,460
Did you lose anything over there?

114
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,120
Did you lose it?

115
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,170
Let's see what else we lost.

116
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,600
Su.

117
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
What?

118
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,520
I bought all the valuable things at home.

119
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,840
Now it’s returned to its owner.

120
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,400
Su Xiaomeng did this.

121
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,640
This immoral thing.

122
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,480
What should I do?

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,120
I'll go find her.

124
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,200
Why?

125
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,960
She's not at the guesthouse.

126
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,200
Call her.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Where's my phone?

128
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,520
Call mom. Call mom.

129
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,660
[The phone is turned off.]

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm so mad.

131
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Luckily the house is still open.

132
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
Honey, welcome home.

133
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,880
Why are you here?

134
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,600
What are you talking about?

135
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
Isn't this our house?

136
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,280
Of course I'm here.

137
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,960
I heard that

138
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,320
about you and Du Li Li.

139
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Who said that?

140
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,960
Don't listen to them.

141
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,920
I know.

142
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,720
It must be a rumor

143
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Su Xiaomeng.

144
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
You don't know.

145
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,840
her parents came to our company last week.

146
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,600
They approached you

147
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,880
She approached you

148
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,360
because she has ulterior motives against you.

149
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,520
The poor look ugly.

150
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
Su Xiaomeng has nothing against you.

151
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,740
Why did she blackmail you?

152
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,520
Honey, let me tell you.

153
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,080
She seduced me.

154
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
I refused.

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
I didn't expect her to tell on me.

156
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
She framed me.

157
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,640
You mean I wronged you?

158
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Honey,

159
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,680
You have to trust me.

160
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,600
We are husband and wife.

161
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,040
Well said.

162
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,480
We're a couple.

163
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,520
I bought you your favorite

164
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,920
beef meatballs noodles.

165
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,880
I don't want to eat this now.

166
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
I want to eat Bubble Oil Cake.

167
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,120
That's the restaurant.

168
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,360
It's very far from our house.

169
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,890
dozens of kilometers away.

170
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,520
It's cold outside.

171
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,680
What's the problem?

172
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,660
I'll buy it for you.

173
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,120
Bubble.

174
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,440
Bubble cake.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,800
I caught a cold.

176
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,240
What's wrong?

177
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Don't mention it.

178
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,290
Lin Jing tricked me out yesterday.

179
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,160
She asked me to buy her some bubble cake.

180
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,520
I ran a dozen kilometers

181
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,040
and almost froze to death.

182
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,760
When I got there, I found out

183
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,360
only in the morning.

184
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,300
I think Lin Jing is suspecting me.

185
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,120
Keep a low profile in the company.

186
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,120
We have to hurry up to transfer the property.

187
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,720
The annual cocktail party is about to begin.

188
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,890
We can take the opportunity to carry out the plan.

189
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Okay, don't be angry.

190
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
Have some fruit.

191
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,160
