I don't know.

Next time, please come
with full information.

50

The people of the Eastern Palace
are great at keeping secrets.

51

All I heard was that she accidentally
triggered weapons

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,260

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,500
You are funny.

114
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,340
There's no such light blue rabbit.

115
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,740
It's just

116
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,100
an ordinary rabbit.

117
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,180
It's fierce

118
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,380
and bold.

119
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,700

120
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,420
It doesn't matter

121
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,180

129
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,340

152
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,940

These three are thieves.

159

They disguised themselves as refugees

160

They even stole money from those

they might go against their owner.

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,660
Your Majesty, I, Zhuang Fucheng,
respectfully greet you.

185
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,060
I guess Mr. Zhuang's here with scissors.

186
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,740
I brought

187
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,420
what you asked for.

188
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,740
Your Majesty.

189
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,260
Liu Qinyuan is corrupt.
He colluded to amass wealth.

190
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,980
It's time to give him some punishment.

191
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,460
And we should do this
in a convincing way.

192
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,060
Eunuch Song,

193
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,380
I heard that when Yao inspected
the repair of the Museum,

194
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,500
something was stolen.

195
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,500
I didn't hear about this.

196
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,260
Your Majesty, forgive me.

197
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,900
I was busy
serving His Highness the whole day.

198
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,740
All the ladies seemed normal.

199
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,540
If there was something strange...

200
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,100
It was the maid of Mei Yushan,
the daughter of the Grand Chancellor,

201
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,980
who tried to approach the Crown Prince
in the disguise of a palace maid.

202
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,660
But nothing really happened.

203
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,820
Then the lunar eclipse happened.

204
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,020
All the other ladies left.

205
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,820
Mei Yushan was the only one
who stayed behind.

206
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,660
Mei Yushan again.

207
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,700
I guess

208
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,300
I have underestimated her.

209
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,540
We've never decided who's going
to be the Crown Princess all this time.

210
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,780
I think

211
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Zhuang Yangyang,
the daughter of Director Zhuang,

212
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,940
who is elegant and decent,

213
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,180
could be a good choice.

214
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,940
Yes.

215
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,100
On behalf of my daughter,

216
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,220
I thank you, Your Majesty.

217
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,540
You.

218
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,580
Come here.

219
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,380
I'm talking about you.

220
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,380
Come forward.

221
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,260
Yes, Eunuch Song.

222
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
I have served in this palace
for over 20 years.

223
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,220
Because of you,

224
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,980
I almost lost my life.

225
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,620
I don't understand.

226
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,180
Tell me,

227
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
the night at the Museum,

228
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,460
why did you approach the Crown Prince
as a palace maid?

229
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,580
Besides,

230
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,740
something from the Museum was stolen.

231
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,980
A witness said
that you were near the showroom then.

232
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,060
What's your explanation?

233
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,340
Not telling me?

234
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,140
Fine.

235
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,580
Then I'll ask the Department of Prudence

236
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,900
to help you refresh your memory.

237
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,780
Take her away.

238
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,380
Yes.

239
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,500
Wait.

240
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,940
It's Guard Xingshi.

241
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Guard Xingshi,

242
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,860
I'm following the orders of Her Majesty.

243
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,980
Is there anything wrong?

244
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,820
I dare not defy

245
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,420
the orders of Her Majesty.

246
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,780
But Eunuch Song hasn't found any proof

247
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,940
of her crime.

248
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,420
Taking her away like this

249
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,980
seems improper.

250
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,660
Guard Xingshi, you don't understand.

251
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
That night at the Museum,

252
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I already found this maid strange.

253
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,900
That night at the Museum,

254
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I was there, too.

255
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,420
She was not the only one there.

256
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,420
If so,

257
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,380
should all the ladies and maids

258
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,460
go with you for interrogation?

259
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,940
That's not necessary.

260
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,340
I just wonder
why you try so hard to protect Mei.

261
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,380
Could it be...

262
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,300
I am the guard of the Eastern Palace.

263
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,980
I protect truth, not persons.

264
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,700
Are you questioning my character?

265
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,220
Guard Xingshi.

266
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,260
This is about the assassination
of the Crown Prince.

267
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,620
His Highness ordered

268
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,660
that this must be kept a secret.

269
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,580
Eunuch Song,

270
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,900
are you trying to disobey
the Crown Prince?

271
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,660
Well, I see now.

272
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,100
I will take my leave then.

273
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,420
Sorry for disturbing you.

274
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,300
Thanks for speaking up for me.

275
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,340
Are you okay?

276
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
You don't need to thank me.

277
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,700
That is what I should do.

278
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Why are you hiding here?

279
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,620
School is boring.

280
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,020
Little Master.

281
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,900
Here.

282
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,140
After you two switch back,

283
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,420
what will you do?

284
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,860
Leave here,

285
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,460
of course.

286
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,500
In such a hurry?

287
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,100
I...

288
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,980
Little Master, you are kind to me.

289
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,820
I know it.

290
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,700
However,

291
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,340
I can't stay here forever.

292
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,140
Remember.

293
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,220
Don't let anyone find out

294
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,580
about you two switching bodies.

295
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,340
I can protect you here.

296
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,740
Out there,

297
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,940
you have to protect yourself.

298
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,820
Mr. Bai.

299
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,100
Where is the Crown Prince?

300
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,260
Inside.

301
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,220
Your Highness.

302
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,780
I didn't see you at school just now.

303
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,620
Miss Mei is here, too.

304
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,580
I'm tired of writing.

305
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,860
So I came out to admire the flowers.

306
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,060
What are you here for?

307
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,980
Something went wrong
with the recruitment.

308
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,460
Let's talk over there.

309
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,740
What's wrong?

310
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,540
Don't move.

311
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,580
I will be fine if you don't move.

312
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,780
Ignore her.

313
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,780
We'll talk over there.

314
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,540
[Chongwen Academy]
It's all my fault

315
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,060
that such things happened.

316
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,180
You just like

317
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,740
to take on all the responsibilities.

318
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,940
They have impeached me many times.

319
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,340
If they don't impeach me,

320
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,700
I'd feel weird.

321
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,380
Are you really not going to blame me?

322
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,900
When have I ever blamed you?

323
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,740
By the way,

324
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,340
I came with another thing today.

325
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,500
I heard on the day
you went to the Museum,

326
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,100
a pearl went missing.

327
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,820
Something in the Museum went missing.

328
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,460
How did the whole palace find out?

329
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,620
My mother sent someone
to ask me about it.

330
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,740
You also came for it.

331
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,300
I just want to know

332
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,780
if you remember

333
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,780
what this pearl looks like.

334
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,420
No.

335
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,460
Why do you ask?

336
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,260
I...

337
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,540
I need to know

338
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,860
if this one is

339
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,500
the same one I once saw before.

340
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,420
Your Highness, your carriage
for going out of the palace is ready.

341
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,620
I will deal with the refugee situation.

342
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,820
Don't worry about it.

343
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,700
Be careful.

344
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,700
Those men are indeed some petty thieves.

345
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
I was there during the hiring days.

346
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,900
I noticed something wrong with them.

347
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,260
They don't even know
the towns of Lantian.

348
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,940
But Mr. Bai is on your side.

349
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,020
He wanted to hire those people.

350
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,700
I dared not say anything.

351
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,540
Your...

352
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,700
Evil officers.

353
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
You refuse to say anything?

354
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,860
Sir,

355
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,140
no one told us what to do.

356
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,980
All we did was claim some wages.

357
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,220
Dan, don't explain to them.

358
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,980
Wait, who are you?

359
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,900
You want us to tell.

360
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,220
It hurts.

361
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,660
Prepare me some good wine and food.

362
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,260
Hurry.

363
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,220
Are you afraid?

364
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,820
Afraid of what?

365
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,900
Are you afraid that I'll kill you

366
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,260
and you'll never have such good wine

367
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,300
or such amazing food?

368
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,780
Don't scare us.

369
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,620
We have an acquaintance

370
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,220
in the palace.

371
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,540
Who?

372
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,980
Boss, we mustn't say it.

373
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,660
Why can't we say it?

374
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,020
Look at the situation now.

375
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,740
Say it out.

376
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,420
Scare him to death, Boss.

377
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,420
If I tell you, you'll be so scared.

378
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,180
Try me.

379
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,980
Who do you know in the palace?

380
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,220
My daughter.

381
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,700
She... She's also my daughter.

382
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,020
She is very famous.

383
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,980
Well,

384
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,660
I am an officer in the palace.

385
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,940
May I know your daughter's name?

386
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
In which department does she work?

387
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,300
An officer.

388
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,740
Just an officer.

389
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,980
You are from the palace, too?

390
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,900
I'll tell you.

391
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,260
- My daughter...
- Boss, stop.

392
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,660
- Why not tell him?
- What?

393
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,980
- We can't say.
- Why not?

394
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,700
- Stop.
- What are you afraid of?

395
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,860
- Why can't we tell him?
- Why can't we tell him?

396
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,620
We just can't.

397
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,460
It's time to intimidate him.

398
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,700
- We can't.
- What's wrong with you?

399
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,620
- We should say it.
- No.

400
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,700
If you refuse to tell who's behind this,

401
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,820
according to the law,

402
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,940
I'll have you beheaded in twenty days.

403
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
Look at that pavilion.

404
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,180
Doesn't it look just like the one
where we switched bodies?

405
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,980
That day, it was just like this.

406
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,740
As soon as the pearl glowed,
we switched bodies.

407
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,580
Are you ready?

408
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,340
Take this.

409
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,700
Why isn't it glowing?

410
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,300
It's a strange thing.

411
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,780
It should glow on its own, right?

412
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,780
Don't let the Moon Spirit Pearl
hear you.

413
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,340
This thing is spiritual.

414
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,380
Do you think it's too dark?

415
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,780
Do you have any candles with you?

416
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,260
Is it because we didn't pray
to the immortals?

417
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,380
Maybe the postures we laid in
were too ordinary?

418
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,820
How about

419
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,220
we change our postures?

420
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,220
Switch.

421
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,740
Did we make it?

422
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,260
No.

423
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,860
Abracadabra.

424
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,140
Switch!

425
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,340
Did we make it?

426
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,180
No.

427
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,780
What about now?

428
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,460
No.

429
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,900
Did we make it?

430
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,460
And now?

431
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,660
Did we make it?

432
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,940
Abracadabra.

433
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,340
Switch!

434
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,540
Stop saying those words.

435
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,060
They are the words of Taishang Laojun.

436
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,860
What do we do then? It's not working.

437
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,980
The Crown Prince was here that night.

438
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,380
Should we ask him to join us, too?

439
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,380
So you mean

440
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,300
we have to ask

441
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,820
Eunuch Song
and other eunuchs to join us, too?

442
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,060
We won't even know

443
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,180
between whom the switching happens.

444
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,180
So you won't cut my head off?

445
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,620
I won't.

446
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,820
Then I'm relieved.

447
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,180
Eunuch Song,

448
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,500
is there a rule

449
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,940
saying no one
should sit next to His Highness?

450
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,300
Uhh...

451
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,140
Of course,

452
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,500
no.

453
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,580
Well, since there are no such rules,

454
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,020
I'll sit next to him.

455
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,820
How can you sit here?

456
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,780
You get up.

457
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Dongxi, I...

458
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
I'm not Dongxi.

459
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,700
He is...

460
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,140
I know.

461
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,900
Your Highness?

462
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,740
Have you ever heard

463
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,780
of such a precedent
for civilians marrying royals?

464
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,780
Why do you suddenly ask?

465
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,900
A prince wants to know.

466
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,700
Have you?

467
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,860
In our history, there were civilians

468
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,060
marrying into the palace.

469
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,660
Have you ever heard

470
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,060
of a royal falling in love
with a female thief?

471
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,900
A female thief?

472
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,900
A female thief?

473
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,220
I don't mean a vicious female thief.

474
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,180
I mean a very adorable female thief.

475
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,740
There are adorable female thieves?

476
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,700
I've never heard of such things.

477
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,700
However,

478
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,980
civilians who married
into the royal family

479
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,620
didn't seem to end well.

480
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,180
They did become the Empress,

481
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,940
but they died in a fire.

482
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,740
You...

483
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,580
Your Highness.

484
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,740
I don't all the history.

485
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,780
I'm sure there were
plenty of happy endings.

486
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,780
You don't need to worry
about that prince.

487
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,780
Never mind.

488
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,340
As long as she's not a princess
of Shengdong,

489
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,340
I don't care who she is.

490
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,140
You know nothing.

491
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,060
I am just a eunuch.

492
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,340
How could I understand this?

493
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,180
We've been trying the whole night.

494
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
I am still you.

495
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
You are still me.

496
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,700
Have you ever thought about

497
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,180
what if we can't switch back?

498
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,740
I don't know who my parents are.

499
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,860
I grew up with my three fathers
in the Black Dog Alley.

500
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,340
I have suffered

501
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,860
everything.

502
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,900
Now I'm in the palace

503
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,900
enjoying an amazing life every day.

504
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,260
I don't have to worry
about food anymore.

505
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,740
Do you think this is the god

506
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,100
trying to make it up to me?

507
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,140
I grew up
in the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

508
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,100
Although I had everything,

509
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,380
I never enjoyed freedom.

510
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,180
Now we switched bodies.

511
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,220
I don't have to worry
about manners and etiquette.

512
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,740
I feel more relieved.

513
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,860
But

514
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,340
if I have to stay in the palace,

515
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,900
I'll still not be happy.

516
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,340
Besides,

517
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,500
who's going to take care
of my three fathers?

518
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,860
How about I ask my parents
to invite them to my house?

519
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,380
The more people, the merrier.

520
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,940
They don't have to worry about food

521
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,140
or a place to stay.

522
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,300
Really?

523
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,060
Even though I don't know
if my three fathers

524
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,340
will agree to this,

525
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
either way,

526
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,300
thank you, Mei Daidai.

527
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,460
Right. I just had an idea.

528
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,180
Look.

529
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,220
I didn't have any friends
of the same age growing up.

530
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,340
You grew up

531
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,740
alone, too.

532
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,780
Why don't we smear the blood

533
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,060
to be sworn sisters?

534
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,300
It's a good idea.

535
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,540
But I don't think
we need to smear the blood.

536
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,100
What are you afraid of?

537
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,060
It will be my blood anyway.

538
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,460
It was me. Why are you screaming?

539
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,380
Now it's your turn.

540
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,780
All right now.

541
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,700
Gods, please hear us.

542
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,940
Be our witness.

543
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,460
Today, I, Douzi.

544
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,700
I, Mei Yushan.

545
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,020
Become sworn sisters.

546
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,460
From now on, we share happiness

547
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,700
as well as pain.

548
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,700
We weren't born at the same time.

549
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,820
And we don't wish
to die at the same time.

550
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,060
Douzi, you're not sincere.

551
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,620
You don't understand.

552
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,300
Think about it.

553
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,380
If one of us died,

554
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,540
the other one could still live
in the body

555
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,380
of the other person.

556
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,540
How exciting!

557
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,020
Come on.

558
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,180
Cheers.

559
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,100
Get me some water.

560
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,860
You can do it yourself.

561
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,220
I've always been served by others.

562
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,340
You can't ask your sister to serve you.

563
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,980
Otherwise, God will blame you.

564
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,660
Here.

565
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,020
I know how to switch our bodies back.

566
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,060
I know how to do it.

567
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,140
Can we do it now?

568
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,300
Do you remember
when we switched bodies that day,

569
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,620
there was a lunar eclipse?

570
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,260
So the next time
there's a lunar eclipse,

571
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,740
we will be able to switch back, right?

572
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,860
When will that be?

573
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,980
All I know is the lunar eclipse happens

574
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,540
once every few years.

575
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
What do we do then?

576
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,220
Why don't we try it again

577
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,020
when the moon is full next time?

578
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,620
May as well.

579
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,460
After you switch bodies back,

580
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,980
what will you do?

581
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
Leave the palace,

582
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,940
of course.

583
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,380
If I had known it,

584
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,540
I wouldn't have
given her the pearl back.

585
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,580
When you like someone,

586
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,740
shouldn't you try to keep her around

587
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,740
and grow old with each other?

588
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,220
So selfish.

589
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,460
When you like someone,

590
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,420
you should respect her

591
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
and set her free.

592
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,300
Shouldn't we fight for what we love?

593
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,900
You're so cowardly.

594
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,620
How do you rule the country?

595
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
This is not cowardice.

596
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,340
It's called not forcing it.

597
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,500
Stop it.

598
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,500
Be quiet.

599
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,300
So annoying.
