00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,540
Stay here and watch people laugh at you?

183
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,300
Then let's leave together.

184
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,140
Did I just say all that for nothing?

185
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,300
Have you been listening?

186
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,740
You won't leave?

187
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,780
Well, I'm leaving.

188
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,500
You can't leave.

189
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,700
Let go of me.

190
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,860
You can't leave.

191
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,340
Let go.

192
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,980
- You can't go.
- Let go.

193
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,780
Let go of me.

194
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,620
Are you okay?

195
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,660
Are you still feeling bad?

196
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,020
Your Highness.

197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,500
Are you okay?

198
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,260
I'm fine.

199
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,340
Little Diviner,

200
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,500
thank you for saving my life.

201
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,900
I couldn't see clearly underwater.

202
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,380
I worried there might be water snakes,

203
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,260
so I was trying
to pull you up desperately.

204
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,500
I was so scared.

205
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,580
I thought I was going to die.

206
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,380
Fortunately, you are fine.

207
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,620
- You've also got some water here.
- Really?

208
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,380
Douzi.

209
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,420
How could you be so careless?

210
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,180
I was going to...

211
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,220
I was trying to do some exercise.

212
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,460
But maybe I've gained
some weight lately.

213
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,300
So that railing couldn't save me.

214
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,060
Why were you at the lake today?

215
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,980
I was going to...

216
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,060
Your Highness,

217
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,020
are you okay?

218
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,460
Why did you fall into the lake?

219
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm fine.

220
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,420
Ask the Imperial Physicians

221
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,540
to get some medicine for the cold.

222
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,500
Thank you, Your Highness,
for saving my life.

223
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,940
I am very grateful.

224
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:27,980
You may rise.

225
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,860
It was an urgent situation.
I had to save you.

226
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,820
Just lie down.

227
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,900
The Crown Prince
understands your gratitude.

228
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,340
Mr. Bai.

229
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,780
What's the matter?

230
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,060
Go.

231
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,540
Go look into Douzi's maid's background.

232
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,300
Yes.

233
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,580
How dare she!

234
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,380
Your Majesty.

235
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,980
Don't get so angry.

236
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,220
I was the one

237
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,340
who invited her to the palace.

238
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,900
What a bad decision!

239
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,340
How is Yao?

240
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,300
Is he okay after falling into the water?

241
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,900
His Highness hasn't left
the Eastern Palace ever since.

242
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,420
He wouldn't allow physicians
to check on him, either.

243
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,340
How improper!

244
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,180
Stupid girl.

245
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,620
Do you know how to comb hair or not?

246
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,140
My Lady, your hair is too dry.

247
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,580
I will go get some castor oil.

248
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,020
Castor...

249
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,860
Castor oil?

250
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,700
Isn't castor oil used for cooking?

251
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,580
Stupid girl,

252
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,980
do you try to drown me with oil?

253
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,060
Why did you summon me
so suddenly, Sir?

254
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,580
I'm afraid it's not safe here.

255
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,780
It is urgent.

256
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,660
Do you still
have the Crown Prince's jade pendant?

257
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,940
I have been keeping it on me,

258
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,060
in case it might come in handy.

259
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,020
Good.

260
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,300
Try to sneak into Mei's room

261
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,860
and put the plate there.

262
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,540
Meanwhile, spread rumors

263
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,660
saying she has a crush
on the Crown Prince.

264
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,180
Why?

265
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,580
Please enlighten me.

266
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,580
After they got out of the water
this afternoon,

267
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,140
Bai Ye looked at the princess
in a strange way.

268
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,740
I suspect that he knows something now.

269
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,060
Right now,

270
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,660
we must get the princess

271
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,780
out of the palace soon.

272
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,100
A lot of maids had a crush
on the Crown Prince before,

273
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,540
and they were all sent away.

274
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,100
I really have no other choice

275
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,900
but to send her away like this.

276
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,140
Once we get her out,

277
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,820
I'll ask someone to pick her up.

278
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,900
But

279
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,060
the Crown Prince
lost the pendant in the Museum.

280
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,420
Don't forget

281
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,220
the princess was also there that day.

282
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,540
About that,

283
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,260
she would have no explanation.

284
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,900
I see.

285
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,700
I'll get on it.

286
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,060
By the way,

287
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,420
this is important.

288
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,380
The princess must not find out about it.

289
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,180
She won't.

290
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,980
She fell ill coming out of the water.

291
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,260
I think she has a cold.

292
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,100
Douzi.

293
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,780
Why is it so hot?

294
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,460
How do you feel?

295
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,020
It hurts everywhere.

296
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,980
I felt cold when I got out
of the water this afternoon.

297
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,900
I feel even colder now.

298
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,660
What's going on?

299
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,540
Why isn't the medicine working?

300
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,500
The pain is tolerable.

301
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,500
A lot of people
saw us falling into the lake.

302
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,140
If the Empress finds out,

303
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,020
she'll blame us
for making the Crown Prince suffer.

304
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,900
Is she going to punish us?

305
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,900
It's okay if she punishes me,

306
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,220
but she can't punish you.

307
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,500
Even though you are
the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

308
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,820
the empress will still blame you.

309
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,340
Not to mention me.

310
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,300
Then I'll beg Little Master

311
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
to put in a good word for us.

312
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,820
Right, I'll beg Little Master.

313
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,940
Not now.

314
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,540
The empress

315
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,020
will visit His Highness for sure.

316
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,740
Douzi?

317
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,540
Douzi.

318
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,410
[Eastern Palace]

319
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,020
Open the gate, please.

320
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,860
Thank you.

321
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,220
- The Crown Prince has said before...
- Well...

322
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,660
whenever she comes,

323
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,140
she can go in.

324
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Little Master?

325
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,100
Little Master, are you in?

326
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,620
Little Master, are you in there?

327
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,380
His Highness is taking a bath.
Please wait.

328
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Little Master.

329
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,020
Douzi?

330
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,380
The night of the full moon has passed.

331
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,700
Why haven't you left yet?

332
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,540
I'm afraid

333
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,580
I'll be staying for a while.

334
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,820
Why?

335
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,940
The night of the full moon,

336
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,620
the pearl somehow broke
when we tried to switch bodies.

337
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,980
She really can't leave?

338
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,260
That is good news.

339
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,180
If I had put the Moon Spirit Pearl
in my pocket

340
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,020
instead of taking it out,

341
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,340
maybe it wouldn't have broken.

342
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,940
What do I do now?

343
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,180
So what are you

344
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,420
going to do next?

345
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,060
I don't know what to do.

346
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,020
By the way,

347
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,620
why did you show up

348
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
as soon as I fell today?

349
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,260
I was just passing by.

350
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,540
Coming back to the Eastern Palace,

351
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,780
you don't need to pass that lake.

352
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,660
What now?

353
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
Are you interrogating me?

354
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,740
Who are you to decide
which way I take?

355
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,180
Besides,

356
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,380
why didn't you tell me sooner

357
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,820
that you couldn't switch bodies?

358
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,660
I was depressed for nothing these days.

359
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,340
I...

360
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,260
I wanted to tell you.

361
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,620
I came looking for you.

362
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,780
But you told me

363
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,940
to leave

364
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,180
because I was not involved.

365
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,620
So you feel wronged.

366
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,340
Of course, I feel wronged.

367
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,180
I didn't know anyone here.

368
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,260
Finally, I had a Little Master,

369
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,260
but he gave me the cold shoulder.

370
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,940
I remember someone said

371
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,140
that ducklings had their own thoughts.

372
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,260
What does this
have to do with ducklings?

373
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,620
Well, that friend of yours...

374
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,060
The little duckling.

375
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,060
Did it go back to its pond

376
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,140
or was it made into a roast duck?

377
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,980
Yao?

378
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,140
Yao.

379
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,820
What to do? What to do?

380
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,740
Little Master, what do we do?

381
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,420
What to do? What to do?

382
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,020
What are you afraid of?

383
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,580
Just come out with me.

384
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,820
My mother won't kill you.

385
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,420
No.

386
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,260
She... She must be here

387
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,180
to look for trouble

388
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,140
because I fell into the water.

389
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,660
If she finds out

390
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,900
that I'm here watching you shower,

391
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,740
it will make her even more furious.

392
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,260
When did you watch me shower?

393
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
No. She will think it that way.

394
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,380
I came to see you today

395
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,540
to beg you to put in a good word
for Mei Yushan and me.

396
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,420
I'll be fine either way.

397
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,180
But she's a lady with a delicate body.

398
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,180
Nothing can happen to her.

399
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:25,490
[Nangong Yao]

400
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Douzi,

401
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,940
don't go.

402
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,220
Not bad.

403
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,860
Great progress.

404
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,140
Of course.

405
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,140
I'm sixteen now.

406
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm no longer

407
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,980
the little girl
who couldn't protect herself.

408
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,580
Yeah.

409
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,540
You're no longer the little girl
who escaped from Shengdong

410
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,740
and came to me

411
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
in tears begging for something to eat.

412
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,060
You're all grown up now.

413
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,540
It's time to find you a husband.

414
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,140
I don't need a husband.

415
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,740
What about you, Sir?

416
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,020
Do you plan to stay unmarried forever?

417
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,940
I have my plans.

418
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Don't ask too much

419
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,740
about my business.

420
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,980
Then don't ask too much

421
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,900
about my business.

422
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,700
You really can't see

423
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,380
how I feel about you?

424
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,060
Sorry to disturb you this late.

425
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,620
The madam heard
that our lady fell into the water.

426
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,940
So she couldn't wait to visit her.

427
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,500
I understand.

428
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,660
Normally,

429
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,740
we don't allow visitors at this time.

430
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,020
Please don't take too long, madam.

431
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,060
I can't go in there.

432
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,460
You two can just walk along this road.

433
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,820
Thank you.

434
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,620
Madam, after we cross the bridge,

435
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,140
the most beautiful room will be the one.

436
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,220
Shan,

437
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,460
I'm here to see you.

438
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
Put the stuff here.

439
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,140
You wait outside.

440
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,660
Yes, madam.

441
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,020
Shan.

442
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,100
Shan?

443
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,500
I don't understand you.

444
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,220
You refused to take Cui with you,

445
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,940
insisting on coming here alone
to suffer.

446
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,460
You almost lost your life.

447
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,540
You're breaking my heart, you know?

448
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,620
Shan?

449
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,740
Why is it so hot?

450
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,700
Did you catch a cold?

451
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,500
Shan.

452
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,340
Good girl, let me take a look.

453
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,020
Mother.

454
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,900
Who are you?

455
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,300
What... What are you doing
in my daughter's room?

456
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,700
Stay here.

457
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,540
Don't make a sound.

458
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,900
Yao.

459
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,260
Mother.

460
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,140
Why are you in such a hurry?

461
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,340
What are you here for?

462
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,220
I heard you fell into the water.

463
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,900
Of course, I'm in a hurry to see you.

464
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,980
Why didn't you call the physicians?

465
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,180
I am fine.

466
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,500
You're afraid I'll punish someone,
aren't you?

467
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,500
That girl.

468
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,980
She is a lady but she acts rashly.

469
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
If I don't discipline her,

470
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,420
there will be chaos in the palace.

471
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,060
Mother.

472
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,900
Who's in there?

473
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,700
Mother, stop.

474
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,220
Why?

475
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,180
You were just talking about manners.

476
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,940
Look, I'm...

477
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,460
You've finished taking a shower.

478
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,980
Why can't I go in now?

479
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,780
Step aside.

480
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,020
Mother.

481
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,300
When you were showering,

482
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
didn't Nanbei
stay at your service in here?

483
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,460
You are the Crown Prince.

484
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,580
Do you have to do everything yourself?

485
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,820
It would be inconvenient

486
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,260
if they were here
when I was taking a shower.

487
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,740
You haven't changed the furnishings
in the study for two years, right?

488
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,220
Why don't you
get the servants to change them?

489
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,100
Mother.

490
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,180
I'm used to them.

491
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,180
If I had them changed,

492
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,260
I'd feel uncomfortable.

493
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,540
Thrift is a good thing.

494
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,700
If your father knows,

495
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,420
he will be very happy.

496
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,460
But you are the Crown Prince,

497
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,060
you must have what you deserve.

498
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,660
Mother!

499
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,460
Mother,

500
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,660
I just received some new tea.

501
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Let me brew it for you.

502
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,660
You've never invited me to tea.

503
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,260
Why are you in the mood today?

504
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,700
Mother, this tea is very different.

505
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,340
Mother,

506
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,500
this tea is different

507
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,540
from anything you had before.

508
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,260
I don't want tea.

509
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,500
Mother, this tea is very different.

510
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,260
Really different.

511
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,140
Trust me.

512
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,420
This tea...

513
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,740
Mother,

514
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,340
this tea's flavor turns from bitterness
to sweetness after drinking it.

515
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Come on, Mother.

516
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,500
Sit here.

517
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,260
Come on.

518
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,820
Here.

519
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,380
Zuo, You.

520
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,340
Get my tea ready for me.

521
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,380
You know which one it is.

522
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:27,860
Mother,

523
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,260
you aren't suspecting me hiding beauties

524
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,900
in the Eastern Palace, are you?

525
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,980
Mother, don't worry.

526
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,740
If I am interested in someone,

527
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,260
though she stays
in the Eastern Palace...

528
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,460
If it's Mei Yushan,

529
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,900
my answer is no.

530
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,940
If it's someone I don't like,

531
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,860
my answer is also no.

532
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,780
Rich people are just different.

533
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,860
Even the chamber pot is made of jade.

534
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
Mother.

535
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,300
Step aside.

536
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,620
That Mei Yushan of the Mei Family

537
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,340
used to be intelligent and elegant.

538
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,420
I quite liked her then.

539
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,900
But after she came to the palace,

540
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,460
she somehow changed
into a different person.

541
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,660
What?

542
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,420
No manners at all.

543
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,260
Yet, you just have

544
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,140
to defend her.

545
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,100
Step aside.

546
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,500
You.

547
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,540
Get dressed.

548
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,900
It's cold.

549
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,580
Yes, Mother.

550
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,780
Douzi?

551
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,460
[Eastern Palace]

552
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,100
Your Majesty,

553
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,860
as you ordered,

554
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,820
peony water is ready
for you to bathe in.

555
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,540
The peony is blooming beautifully today.

556
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,620
I asked servants to pick
more than two hundred flowers to...

557
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,660
We aren't going to the Huacai Hall.

558
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,780
Let's go to the Guixiu Pavilion.

559
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,860
Yes.

560
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,740
How dare you, Bai Ye!

561
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,100
You covet the woman
that I'm interested in.

562
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,060
Just kidding.

563
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,660
I know you came to save me today.

564
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,300
Yeah.

565
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,140
Sit.

566
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,940
You always think of me

567
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,060
and take care of me.

568
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,700
It's just today...

569
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,420
You knew you weren't
as good at swimming as I am,

570
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,460
why did you come to save me?

571
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,380
I...

572
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,900
How dangerous.

573
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,340
It was fine, actually.

574
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,100
If you weren't here today,

575
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,460
I couldn't have saved them both.

576
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,340
Yeah.

577
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,260
You and I could each save one.

578
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,460
I'll tell you a secret.

579
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,260
What?

580
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,820
Actually, the one you saved today

581
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,340
was the one I wanted to save.

582
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,500
Your Highness,

583
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,940
do you mean it?

584
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,900
That girl is witty and intelligent.

585
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
You and she make a good couple.

586
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,020
This is good.

587
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,460
In the palace,

588
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,380
you can take good care of her.

589
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,420
Hear me out.

590
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,420
Here is what I think.

591
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,580
From now on,

592
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,660
everything about her in the palace

593
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,860
will be my responsibility.

594
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,620
What do you think?

595
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,940
What is this?

596
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,740
It is goji berry and ginger soup I made.

597
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,820
The water was cold.

598
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,620
Drink some to stay warm.

599
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,340
You made it for me?

600
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,540
Of course.

601
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,060
You are the one who treats me the best.

602
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,820
Let's share it.

603
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,100
Don't move.

604
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,820
Move again and I'll yell.

605
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,980
Let go, Shen Feixue.

606
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,340
How do you know my name?

607
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,620
I don't just know your name.

608
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,260
I also know you always hurt yourself
when doing embroidery.

609
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,740
You break strings
when playing the guqin.

610
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,540
You cheat in card games.

611
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,660
- Only when shopping for jewelry,
- I...

612
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,220
you will be excited.

613
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,660
How do you know all this?

614
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,500
A daughter knows her mother well.

615
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,020
Who is your mother?

616
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,380
Tell me.

617
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,740
Where did you hide my Shan?

618
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,500
If you don't tell me,

619
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,300
I'll look for her myself.

620
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,100
Shan.

621
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,020
Shan.

622
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,020
Shan.

623
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,940
Shan.

624
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,260
Can your daughter

625
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,660
fit into such a small cabinet?

626
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,580
What if

627
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,660
you've cut her into pieces
and hidden her in there?

628
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,060
Let go, Shen Feixue.

629
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,100
Give me my daughter.

630
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,060
Do you know

631
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,340
that kidnapping is a felony?

632
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,300
The Empress arrives.

633
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,140
Her Majesty is here.

634
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
What a coincidence.

635
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,700
I don't even have to go to her.

636
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,500
We'll see.

637
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,980
If you're really worried
about your daughter,

638
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,060
don't say anything.

639
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,540
What do you mean by that?

640
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,420
I...

641
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,300
Your daughter

642
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,300
openly brought me into the palace

643
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,500
and left her room at night.

644
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,620
She didn't even show up
when her mother came to visit her.

645
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,620
If the Empress finds out...

646
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,220
Why did she bring you here?

647
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,300
Are you threatening her with something?

648
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,900
Deal with the Empress first.

649
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,460
Greetings, Your Majesty.

650
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,780
I'm sorry

651
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,140
that I didn't go out to welcome you.

652
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,580
Please forgive me.

653
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,500
What are you doing here?

654
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,620
Your Majesty,

655
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,500
I heard today
that my daughter fell into the water.

656
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,260
I'm really worried.

657
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,740
So I'm here to see her.

658
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,220
I also came to visit her because I heard

659
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,420
Miss Mei fell into the water.

660
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,500
You making time to visit my daughter

661
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,620
makes me very grateful.

662
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,820
It's just that she got a cold

663
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,460
and can't get up to meet you.

664
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,460
Please forgive her.

665
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,900
She's ill?

666
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,660
She's faking it.

667
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,820
The one in Yao's room must have been

668
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,060
Mei Yushan.

669
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,660
Once she gets better,

670
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,260
she'll definitely go
to the Huacai Hall to...

671
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,660
I'm already here.

672
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,540
I need to see her

673
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,860
and talk to her.

674
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,060
Only then can I rest assured.

675
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,860
Your Majesty.

676
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,460
I'm afraid she'll infect you.

677
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,140
