Tell me, what is the way
of being a ruler?

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,660
The way of being a ruler.

53
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,940
Are you referring to being a husband?

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,380
In terms of how one
should behave as a husband,

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,020
well, it mainly depends
on whom you marry.

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,180
If you marry
a beautiful and gentle lady,

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,500
you naturally cherish and love her.

58
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,500
But if you marry a shrew, then, well...

59
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,020
Ridiculous.

60
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,780
Mr. Zhou, am I wrong?

61
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,980
The way of a husband and wife
is a part of human relationships

62
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,740
and everyone has to get married.

- you'll be studying here.
- Once you enter the Chongwen Academy,

71
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,860
pay even more attention
to your manners and etiquette.

72
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,700

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,420
I'll familiarize myself
with the surroundings first,

75
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,180
then figure out a way
to sneak out and steal the pearls later.

76

Once we're in the palace,

77
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,700
will we be able to see
His Highness the Crown Prince often?

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,860
His Highness is of noble status

79
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,580
and probably wouldn't bother
with us insignificant figures.

80
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,260
Plus, with a talented lady
like Mei Yushan around,

81
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,940
His Highness might not even notice us.

82
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,020

144
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,220
Where's number three?

145
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,300
The Eighth Prince
is quicker than all of you.

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,940
Why can't I find it?

147
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,260
He's already seated
next to the Crown Prince.

They've taken numbers one and three.

150
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,220
What's the point for us
to choose the other ones?

151
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,540
His Highness likes symmetry,

152
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,820
so we can't sit on either side of him.

153
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,540
That won't do.

154
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,220
I still need to ask him for the pearl.

155
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
Then let's sit on either side
of the Crown Prince.

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,420
Is it true that once we enter
the academy, there's no hierarchy

160
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,580
and we have to follow
the rules of the academy?

161

can sit next to the Crown Prince?

Since Eunuch Song says there isn't,

167
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,860

can sit next to the Crown Prince.

178
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
This will definitely be mine.

179
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,900
Interesting.

180
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,860
So that's how it is.

181
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,300
Then it will definitely be mine.

182
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,660
So, does everyone understand now?

183
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

184
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,100
Come on,

185
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,740
line up.

186
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,220
Line up after me.

187
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,980
I'll go first.

188
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
- I'll go first.
- Don't push.

189
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,060
- The red one.
- The red one.

190
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,540
- You got it on the first try.
- You got it.

191
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,580
- The red one.
- No luck.

192
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,180
Go for it.

193
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,420
Heaven is envious of talents.

194
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,060
Without saying anything else,

195
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,940
I don't think it's happening.

196
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,620
What are you doing?

197
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,900
I noticed that the one
you just drew wasn't red.

198
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,060
I want to help you out.

199
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,860
Later, you should...

200
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,900
It's my turn.

201
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,500
I haven't taken my hand out yet.

202
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,540
Sorry. I was too eager.

203
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,420
Are you cheating?

204
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,900
Do you have something in your hand?

205
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,660
No.

206
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,380
Show me.

207
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,820
This one.

208
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,100
Now, I...

209
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,020
Watch me later.

210
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,380
Okay, I will.

211
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,860
Did you hide it in your clothes?

212
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,180
You must have hidden it in the shoe.

213
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,620
Miss Su, are you done checking me?

214
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,740
If you are, it's my turn.

215
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,380
Don't let her get it.

216
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,740
Don't let her get it.

217
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,700
Sorry, I got it in the end, Miss Su.

218
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,300
Now there are people on both sides.

219
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,420
Now it's symmetrical, right?

220
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,180
Isn't the scenery better here?

221
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,260
Besides,

222
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,460
I actually want to sit in the front.

223
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,140
This seat is too far back.

224
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,300
What luck do I have?

225
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,540
I just happened to draw it.

226
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,020
Don't get too excited too soon.

227
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,020
How about finding someone to trade with?

228
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,060
Brother.

229
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,140
Who wants to trade with me?

230
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,660
How about you trade with me?

231
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,580
Told you.

232
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,420
No.

233
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,820
Brother.

234
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,420
Are you done yet?

235
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,820
It's fine.

236
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,380
All you can see is the Crown Prince.

237
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,900
- Let's go.
- Go away.

238
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,660
Why are you so annoying?

239
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,100
Miss Mei, these books
need to be symmetrical.

240
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,900
Here.

241
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,980
Stay away from me.

242
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,380
How about we switch?

243
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,460
Alright.

244
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,780
Quickly pack up your things.

245
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,460
Yes.

246
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,500
Let's switch seats.

247
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,940
Someone

248
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,300
is so intolerant of others
sitting next to him.

249
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
It's easy.

250
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,540
Just give me back the pearl

251
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,460
and I promise to disappear immediately.

252
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,860
Then I'll add
another five hundred taels.

253
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,620
You can sit there.

254
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,020
I dare you!

255
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,220
Miss Mei, you have some skills.

256
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,820
From your right hand to your left hand,

257
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,220
I didn't expect
even your hair could help.

258
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,380
How did you know?

259
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,380
I didn't mean it that way.

260
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,660
Let's spar a bit.

261
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,540
Miss Zhuang, let me tell you,

262
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,900
this person isn't trustworthy.
Trust me.

263
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
I won't speak out of turn again.

264
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,060
You all,

265
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,100
leave.

266
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,020
You caused such a big fuss

267
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,580
over just one pearl?

268
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,660
No,

269
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,300
that pearl
really is very important to me.

270
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,860
If your pearl is so precious,

271
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,260
why did you deliberately
drop it on me that day?

272
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,740
I...

273
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,100
You took my jade pendant,

274
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,700
tracked me to the relief organization,

275
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,820
approached me under the pretense
of asking for the pearl,

276
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,680
and today you insisted

277
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,140
on sitting next to me
just to get the pearl.

278
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,940
Don't you think your intentions

279
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,620
are too obvious?

280
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,900
That day at the relief organization,

281
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,660
I was really there to see someone.

282
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,140
As the daughter of the Grand Chancellor,

283
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,100
you should uphold decorum

284
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,660
and maintain self-respect.

285
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,860
How am I not upholding decorum
or respecting myself?

286
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,140
If I intentionally dropped
the pearl on you,

287
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,580
then whenever I gamble, I'll lose.

288
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
Whenever I come into money,
it always slips away.

289
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,660
Whenever I...

290
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,740
Whenever I encounter
a dog... it always bites. Happy now?

291
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,460
Are you satisfied now?

292
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,140
You always bite
whenever you encounter a dog?

293
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,220
I mean whenever I encounter a dog,
the dog bites me.

294
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,460
You just made this up, didn't you?

295
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,780
Maybe.

296
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,660
Then according to your logic,

297
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,540
I suspect you were the one
following me, Your Highness.

298
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,900
But then why were you
at the relief organization that day

299
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,100
when I was there?

300
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,860
And why haven't you
returned the pearl to me?

301
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,020
Maybe you were the one trying
to find reasons to get close to me.

302
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,860
Some people are just too cheeky

303
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,260
and lack decorum and self-respect.

304
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,700
They go to great lengths
but only earn others' dislike in return.

305
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,140
Your Highness.

306
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,780
He's so handsome.

307
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,220
The Crown Prince is really handsome.

308
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,660
My brush...

309
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,300
Why is it broken?

310
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,780
This painting should be the best.

311
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,940
Forgive my ignorance.
Please allow me to ask.

312
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,180
What distinguishes this painting?

313
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,740
This one.

314
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,340
That one.

315
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,340
And this one.

316
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,340
I... I still don't understand.

317
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,700
The calluses on the fingers
of the person in the painting

318
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,140
indicate diligent practice
in playing the guqin.

319
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,540
Look at the posture,

320
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,420
Miss Mei must be skilled in dancing.

321
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Just by looking at this painting,
one can tell

322
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,580
that the person depicted
is knowledgeable, rational,

323
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,940
diligent, and eager to learn.

324
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,180
You are completely right, Your Majesty.

325
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,740
It seems that those who come
from the Grand Chancellor's Residence

326
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,220
are truly remarkable.

327
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,260
Yes,

328
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,060
Mei Yushan is exceptionally talented.

329
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,980
And now that her maid
is taking the lead,

330
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,540
let's give them the best accommodation

331
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,300
in the ladies' residence.

332
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

333
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,500
The maid's painting
has unexpectedly taken the lead.

334
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,100
Her Majesty rewards you
with a move to the best chamber.

335
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,740
Thank you, Eunuch Song.

336
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,860
This house is really nice!

337
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,020
I want one too.

338
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,020
Your maid is so talented at painting.

339
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,300
What's her name?

340
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,260
Her name is Mei...

341
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,940
Mei Daidai.

342
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,500
Mei?

343
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,220
Same last name as yours?

344
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,220
You can just call her Mei.

345
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,500
How much did you pay for her?

346
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,980
Can I buy her from you?

347
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,300
Don't even think about it.

348
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,460
She's mine.

349
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,180
Wow,

350
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,060
this is much better than my home
in Black Dog Alley.

351
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,860
And this bed is huge!

352
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,060
It's so comfortable.

353
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,900
You sleep on the floor at night.

354
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,420
Why?

355
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,740
For eighteen years,
I've always slept alone.

356
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,180
How could I get used
to having someone beside me?

357
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,740
Alright,

358
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,500
I'll sleep on the floor if I have to.

359
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,140
But I'll need a pillow and a blanket.

360
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,860
Besides,

361
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,860
it's also letting my body
sleep in your bed.

362
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,820
As for you,

363
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,940
your body

364
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,140
has been pampered for over a decade,

365
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,940
it's time to endure some hardships.

366
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Alright,

367
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,540
let's share the bed.

368
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,180
I don't want to suffer alone either.

369
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,060
Okay then.

370
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,820
There are indeed many treasures
in the palace.

371
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,430
A celadon ivy-patterned vase

372
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,380
that could sell
for dozens of silver taels

373
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,100
is just casually placed here.

374
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,060
Is this one pure silver?

375
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,580
It really is.

376
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,580
Stealing in the palace
is a capital offense.

377
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,220
Please don't cause trouble for me.

378
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,860
What are you talking about?

379
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,380
If it weren't for my shabby clothes

380
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,180
and my hungry stomach out there,

381
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,340
who would do such a thing?

382
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,020
Why did you steal
the Moon Spirit Pearl then?

383
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,420
That was because of my First Father.

384
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,860
My Second and Third Fathers
didn't want to do it either.

385
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,380
But then that woman said

386
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,900
there were many famous thieves
in the martial world

387
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,300
who couldn't steal this pearl.

388
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,780
As soon as my First Father heard that,

389
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,180
he immediately agreed
with a bang on the table.

390
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,900
My First Father,
he's just got a big ego.

391
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,740
This pot.

392
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,780
Don't underestimate it
just because it can't hold much water.

393
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
It's worth at least

394
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,540
seventy to eighty silver taels.

395
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,260
Let me wipe it.

396
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm wiping it since it's dirty.

397
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,460
None of the items you mentioned

398
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,580
are as valuable

399
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,060
as any of the items on that rack.

400
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,260
Really?

401
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,900
I know this thing.

402
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,980
It's very valuable.

403
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,700
It's from the palace
of the previous dynasty.

404
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,940
It must be an antique then.

405
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,500
A funerary item.

406
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,620
Do you like it?

407
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,460
It belongs to the dead?

408
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,540
That's bad luck.

409
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,620
You annoying Mei Daidai,
were you trying to trick me?

410
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,020
Now you've learned
to play tricks on people?

411
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,540
Aren't you only interested
in valuable items?

412
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,180
Well,

413
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,420
I'm not a tomb raider.

414
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,860
I don't touch these things.

415
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,020
Besides, I have high standards.

416
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,580
I've seen all kinds of good stuff.

417
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,660
Remember,

418
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,940
speak less and observe more.

419
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,340
Never pretend to understand
when you don't.

420
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,980
Don't cause trouble for us.

421
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,140
Us, huh? I don't think so.

422
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,540
Right now, you're a maid.

423
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,900
Maids do what maids
are supposed to do.

424
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,940
Clean the room,

425
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,580
dust, and pour me some tea.

426
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,020
Hurry.

427
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,940
Pour you some tea, huh?

428
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,500
What are you doing?

429
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,900
This is worth dozens of taels.

430
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,940
You broke it just like that.

431
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,300
Dust, huh?

432
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,260
There's too much dust.
I can't get it all off.

433
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,700
This has cost me dozens of taels again.

434
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,380
This thing seems to be really dusty too.

435
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,380
Don't break it.

436
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,140
Don't break it.

437
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,140
Weren't you the one who said
you don't touch things from the dead?

438
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm just afraid
I can't afford to pay for it.

439
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,100
This way, I saved a few hundred taels.

440
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,460
Is there anywhere else
that needs cleaning?

441
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,620
No need.

442
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,140
My dear friend, please stop cleaning.

443
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,940
My bad.

444
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,460
I'll slap myself as punishment.

445
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,620
Don't slap my face.

446
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,020
Where on earth are you hiding,
Crown Prince?

447
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,100
I don't believe I can't find you.

448
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,700
My dear friend,

449
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,500
where does
the Crown Prince actually live?

450
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,700
The Eastern Palace.

451
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,380
That pearl must be
in the Eastern Palace.

452
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,100
Let me go and check.

453
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,860
Do you think the Eastern Palace
is a candy store or a tofu shop?

454
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,340
It's not easy to get in.

455
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,340
What should we do then?

456
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,700
Stay calm and patient.

457
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,860
Wait for the right moment.

458
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,460
Then let's...

459
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,340
Shush.

460
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
Even though this face is my own,

461
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,660
why does it look
more and more detestable?

462
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,980
What am I waiting for?

463
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,380
I'll get that pearl today,

464
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,820
switch my body back,
and leave the palace.

465
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,870
Then whenever I gamble, I'll lose.

466
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,340
Whenever I come into money,
it always slips away.

467
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,220
Whenever I...

468
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,420
Whenever I encounter
a dog... it always bites. Happy now?

469
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,460
And why haven't you
returned the pearl to me?

470
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Maybe you were the one trying
to find reasons to get close to me.

471
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,740
Your Highness, please have some tea.

472
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,540
Why did he only drink one cup of tea?

473
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,260
[You]
[*You means right]

474
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,580
[You]
He's really strange today.

475
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,820
[Xingqing Hall]

476
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,420
Nan Bei.

477
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,100
Your Highness,

478
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,340
today, the Imperial Kitchen
has prepared some cherry blossom cakes.

479
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,820
Nan Bei said he's going to fetch some

480
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,900
for you to taste.

481
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,020
Zuo went along as well.

482
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
This glutton

483
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,540
must be craving it himself.

484
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,540
Come with me.

485
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,220
Yes, Your Highness.

486
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,140
So many guards

487
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,500
and the wall is still so high.

488
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,620
[ Eastern Palace]

489
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,220
If I bring your token

490
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,820
and wear your clothes,

491
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,580
won't I be able to enter
the Eastern Palace?

492
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,820
You...

493
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,980
Take this!

494
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,580
Who hit me?

495
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Who hit me?

496
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,820
You pervert!

497
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,980
Someone!

498
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,180
Someone! Please come quickly!

499
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,260
You two, come with me.

500
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,740
We can't let this seductress get away.

501
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,940
- Go away!
- You seductress.

502
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,300
Someone!

503
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,580
Someone! Please come quickly!

504
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,380
What happened?

505
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,380
Just now...

506
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,700
Just now, there was a palace maid

507
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,620
who noticed that I am good-looking,

508
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,940
elegant, and charming.

509
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,660
Stop.

510
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,420
Get to the point.

511
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,820
That woman harassed me.

512
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,700
Harassed you?

513
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,820
Which way did she go?

514
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,700
That way.

515
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,180
Commander Fei,

516
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,820
[Fei Kuai]
you must stand up for me!

517
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,100
[Fei Kuai]

518
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,580
[Fei Kuai]
Don't chase...

519
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,100
You have to chase her.
Why don't you chase her?

520
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,300
The wrong person.

521
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,500
Don't chase the wrong person.

522
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,980
Right, we can't chase
the wrong person.

523
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,180
She's thin,

524
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,940
wearing a green outfit,

525
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,180
and about this tall.

526
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,540
Let's go!

527
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,900
Commander Fei, I'll count on you.

528
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,380
Miss Mei.

529
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Miss Mei.

530
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,780
Eunuch Song.

531
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,540
Where's your young lady?

532
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,700
My young lady is new to the palace

533
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,420
and finds everything fascinating.
So she's out exploring the palace.

534
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,340
Please forgive her, sir.

535
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,380
Even if she's
the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

536
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,580
she can't disregard the rules
on her first day in the palace.

537
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,020
She might face punishment for this.

538
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,700
You advised us earlier

539
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,100
not to go out at night
without permission,

540
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,340
so naturally,
we wouldn't dare to disobey.

541
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,100
But it's still daytime

542
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,300
and the young lady...

543
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,220
You cheeky little servant girl,

544
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,340
trying to be clever with me, huh?

545
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,940
Fine, I can't argue with you.

546
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,780
Let me tell you,

547
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,500
I'm not the one looking for her.

548
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,140
You go talk to the person yourself.

549
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,180
Come with me.

550
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,820
Your Highness,
my apologies for the delay.

551
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,700
Miss Mei is not in her accommodation
at the moment.

552
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,220
Therefore,
I have brought her maid to you.

553
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,300
It seems I've made this trip in vain.

554
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,260
Aren't you the palace maid
who poured the liquor that night?

555
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,780
She's the female thief that night.

556
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,060
Your Highness,

557
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,220
I accompanied my young lady
to the museum on that day

558
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,620
and was mistakenly identified
as a palace maid by a eunuch.

559
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,420
Since you are a maid
from the Grand Chancellor's Residence,

560
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,820
why didn't you clarify the situation
on the spot?

561
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,940
Don't... Don't move!

562
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,140
I was telling you to not move.

563
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,460
Go to hell!

564
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,380
Where did she go?

565
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,620
Go... Go after her!

566
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,440
[Astronomical Bureau]

567
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,500
How is it possible?

568
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,860
It's been more than ten years,

569
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,500
why can't I see her face clearly?

570
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,860
Did I calculate something wrong?

571
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,100
Since serving Your Highness
is such an important matter,

572
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,940
my young lady
naturally takes it very seriously

573
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,060
and supports it wholeheartedly.

574
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,420
It was just a case
of going along with the mistake,

575
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,020
which led to the misunderstanding
that day.

576
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,220
Your young lady has such respect for me?

577
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,660
Today, in class,

578
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,860
she showed no shame

579
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,140
and no respect for me.

580
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,060
Where is she now?

581
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,660
Wasn't it yesterday that you said

582
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,700
you wanted to be
the bravest man in Shengdong?

583
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,020
I want to grow up quickly

584
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,460
and drive away the Jixi Army.

585
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,140
As expected
of Shengdong's little general.

586
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,900
When I grow up,
I want to protect Your Majesty,

587
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,140
the little prince,

588
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,180
the little princess,

589
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,260
and everyone else in the palace.

590
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,580
Just like my father,
I want to be a great hero.

591
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,460
Come on. Hurry up.

592
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,900
How is Her Majesty?

593
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,660
