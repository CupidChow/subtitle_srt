Oh no.

184
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,700
Mei Daidai told me to be reserved.

185
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,980
What am I supposed to say now?

186
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,180
Should I go out?

187
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,580
It's not like the Eastern Palace.

188
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,700
There are not many rooms here.

189
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,540
If you don't allow me to sleep here,

190
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,220
I'll have to sleep outside.

191
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,820
Then you sleep in the bed.

192
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,340
I'll sleep on the floor.

193
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,140
How can I bear
to allow my Crown Princess

194
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
to sleep on the floor?

195
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,100
All right. I won't tease you.

196
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,980
Go to bed.

197
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,300

198

Are you asleep?

200
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,020
Are you afraid that I can't sleep

201
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,900
or that I've fallen asleep?

202
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460

Still cold.

It's not cold now.

If only we could stay like this forever.

217

Despite living a humble life
with simple meals,

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,140
with you by my side,

219
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,460
I am happy.

220
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,900
Me too.

221
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,060
As long as you are by my side,

222
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,540
mantou can be

223
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,260
as tasty as a lavish feast.

224
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,700
On my way back,

225
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,500
I saw a lot of displaced people.

226
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,860
They don't even have mantou.

227
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,660
I really can't bear it

228
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,420
and I'm unreconciled.

229
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,940
If we don't stop Xingshi
from ruling the country like this,

230
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,860
it'll be destroyed soon.

231
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,020
In my opinion,

232
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,260
it doesn't matter whether we call
the country Jixi or Shengdong,

233
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,620
it's important
that the people can live a good life.

234
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,140
Do you really think so?

235
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,940
Of course.

236
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,860
If you want to return to the palace,

237
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,740
I'll support you.

238
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,860
I have a great chance,

239
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
but I'm not
one hundred percent sure I'll win.

240
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,220
In case...

241
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,660
I mean in case...

242
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,980
Are you afraid?

243
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,220
I'm not afraid.

244
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,300
I'm sure you'll win.

245
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
It's also okay if it doesn't work.

246
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,420
If so, we'll just go on a trip
to the world.

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,740
I'm sure I can feed both of us.

I won't make you suffer.

251
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
I believe you.

252
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,740
You won't make me

253
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,860

You can't go out.

The Crown Prince doesn't let you go
for your good.

266
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,860
Exactly.

No one can guarantee you won't be hurt
by weapons when fighting.

268
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Yeah, well, in the battle,

00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
no one can tell who will lose...

From now on,

274
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,780
don't mention the word "lose"
in front of me.

275
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,020
If you have to say it,

276
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,220
well, then use "meow" instead.

277
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,020

278
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,580
What?

279
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,980
Meow. All right.

280
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,580
Uhh...

281
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,980
Is that carriage at the door for me?

282
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,180

If he meowed,

285
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,140
just took the box inside

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,580
But it was so easy.

315
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,740
Come on.

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,460

Let him go.

319
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,260
I knew something was wrong with Bai Ye.

320
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,660
After that day he went out
of the palace to deliver information,

321
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,260
I found out
when you'd come to the palace

322
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,020
and what you were going to do.

323
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,140
I knew everything

324
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,620
so I was waiting for you

325
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,420
to come and arrest you.

326
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,580

Threatening him with me

330
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,380
won't work.

331
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,820
Your Highness,

332
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,620
I destroyed your country
and caused you to be exiled before.

333
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,420
Now

334
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,980
I got you surrounded again.

335
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,660
I'm not worth it.

336
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,140
I'm not worth your saving.

337
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,980
Your Highness,

338
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,260
if you put down your weapon now,

339
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,500
it'll only make me feel more guilty.

340
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,340
If it were me pointed by his sword now,

341
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm sure you'd do the same thing.

342

I'm your princess.

345
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,300
Get out of my way.

346
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,900
Step aside.

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,220
Step aside.

00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,380
Step aside.

00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,500
I am affectionate and righteous.

356

Wait.

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,340
I'm standing
on the side of justice and my lover.

362
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,940
Protect His Highness.

363
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,780
Still fighting?

364
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,780
No more fighting.

365
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,060
You go there.

366
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
You, there.

367
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
You too.

368
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,100
You idiot.

369
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,060
How dare you touch our Crown Princess!

370
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,100
I'll kill you.

371
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,180
If it weren't for the Princess,

372
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,460
I would have killed you by now.

373
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,340
You can argue.

374
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,900
But no more fighting. You hear me?

375
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,620
No more fighting.

376
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,620
Big Head Yu.

377
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,660
Come on, Second Father, catch this.

378
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,460
Listen to me.

379
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,820
Don't you dare fight!

380
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,740
Otherwise, I'll hit you

381
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,060
with my hammer here.

382
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,340
Third Father.

383
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Take this.

384
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,780
Okay.

385
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,620
You are in charge here.

386
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,580
Don't worry.

387
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,140
Why are they fighting again?

388
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,100
How long has it been?

389
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,540
How's it?

390
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,700
Did Little Master get hurt?

391
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,020
Little Master,

392
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,980
why don't you take a break
and let me do it for you?

393
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,020
Little Master, be careful.

394
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,220
Surrender now,

395
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,260
I can spare your life.

396
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,020
I should be the one to say that.

397
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,260
Mei.

398
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,780
You're awful.

399
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,980
It's all your fault.

400
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,820
Go get the physicians.

401
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,340
Mei Daidai.

402
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,140
This is your fault.

403
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,940
Go get the physicians.

404
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,220
Go get the physicians!

405
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,700
Mei...

406
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,220
Go.

407
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,980
Please don't die.

408
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,540
Yes.

409
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,540
Physicians!

410
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,820
Just now

411
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,740
you were standing on the side
of the Crown Prince.

412
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,780
Now

413
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,580
you gave your life for me.

414
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm sorry.

415
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,860
I just understood your heart now.

416
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,060
It's my fault.

417
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,380
How could you leave me behind?

418
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,620
Your Highness, are you all right?

419
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,900
Mei,

420
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,740
you can't die.

421
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,580
I hired the best craftsmen

422
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,020
to fix the Moon Spirit Pearl.

423
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,260
Tonight we have the full moon.

424
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,780
I've decided to give it another try.

425
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,700
I'm not going to let you die.

426
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,180
If one of us has to die,

427
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,020
I would switch my body with yours

428
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,420
and exchange my life with your life.

429
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,420
No, no.

430
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,740
You can't do it.

431
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,380
Did you find the Grand Tutor yet?

432
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,140
I'm warning you,

433
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,660
if this works,

434
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,620
you need to ask him to save me at once.

435
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,780
Or I will haunt you as a ghost.

436
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,100
I'll show up in the Grand Tutor's dreams

437
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,140
to remind him
of asking you to recite books.

438
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
I see.

439
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,540
Besides,

440
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,380
you can't allow him to suck my blood
with a poisonous worm.

441
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,100
Otherwise, I'll...

442
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,700
Did it really work?

443
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,740
Oh no.

444
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,660
How do I tell this to Yao?

445
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,580
Grand Tutor!

446
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,620
Hurry.

447
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,060
I heard there was someone

448
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,500
who was almost dead.

449
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,260
Why did she faint here?

450
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,900
I don't know.

451
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,420
Save the dying one first.

452
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,260
Step aside.

453
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,460
Too bad it was a little off.

454
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,300
It was so close to the heart.

455
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,620
Any closer to the heart
and she'd be dead.

456
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,260
Don't worry.

457
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,220
My cutie.

458
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,420
This one is big and strong.

459
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,740
She is dying.

460
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,140
You want to suck her blood with this?

461
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,380
Should I save her or not?

462
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,740
You should.

463
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,740
I'll put it here.

464
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,940
Look, look.

465
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,980
That's enough.

466
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,180
All the blood's sucked out.

467
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,180
Do something about it.

468
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,140
If this keeps up, Miss Mei will die.

469
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,340
Do something about it, Grand Tutor.

470
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,260
This really must stop.

471
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,500
Grand Tutor.

472
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,180
Her hand moved.

473
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,060
Her hand.

474
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,100
It worked.

475
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,100
Now you are full.

476
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,780
Good.

477
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,540
Weren't there two worms?

478
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,380
Why is there only one left?

479
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
Right.

480
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,060
Where is the other one?

481
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,220
Then look for it.

482
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,140
Look for it.

483
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,660
Where are you looking?

484
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,700
Are you sure it's on her?

485
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,300
If it's not on her, then it's on her.

486
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,420
Look for it.

487
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,340
Not this one, either.

488
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,940
My worm...

489
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,380
Well, then where can I find my worm?

490
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,900
Neither this one nor that one.

491
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,820
Listen,

492
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,860
if you don't find this one,

493
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,180
the other one will come after you.

494
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,620
Look for it.

495
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,860
I can't believe
you still have an appetite.

496
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,940
Knowing the one I love survived,

497
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,460
I'm in a good mood.

498
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,300
Of course, I'll eat more.

499
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,380
Don't you worry about yourself?

500
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,660
I'll die without anything to regret.

501
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,620
For me,

502
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,660
whatever conviction I end up with,

503
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,380
it'll be easier than being the emperor.

504
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,340
You are conscious.

505
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,980
If you could see this through earlier,

506
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,780
you wouldn't have ended up here.

507
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,500
You don't have to worry about me.

508
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,700
Being an emperor, you'll have to
shoulder lots of responsibilities.

509
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,220
The one who works hard in the future

510
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,740
will be you.

511
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,860
[Yong'an Gate]

512
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,180
Nangong Yao ascended the throne
as the Emperor

513
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,460
and changed the country's name
back to Jixi.

514
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,020
Xingshi was exiled to Shengdong

515
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,900
and could never
take one step back in Jixi.

516
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,860
[Grand Chancellor's Residence]
Father, mother.

517
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,660
I'm now bidding my farewell to you.

518
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,940
Why do you have to
give up the glory and wealth

519
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,620
to go to that Xingshi?

520
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,620
He was sent into exile.

521
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,140
What for?

522
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,460
All right.

523
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,380
Stop talking.

524
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Let her go.

525
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,900
At least our sons have jobs
in the imperial court now.

526
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,940
Right?

527
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,100
I didn't expect you

528
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,260
to take care of us

529
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,420
when we grow old.

530
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,540
You can go now.

531
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,740
We'll just forget

532
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
we ever had a daughter.

533
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,860
Just go.

534
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,140
Shan.

535
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,900
Father,

536
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,180
mother,

537
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,100
Douzi will take care of you for me.

538
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,540
Shan.

539
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,460
I hate to see you leave.

540
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,740
You dress only in soft yarn.

541
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,220
You sleep with white jade pillows.

542
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,540
Even when you have bitter gourd,

543
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,100
you make it too fancy.

544
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,940
I'm afraid, in Shengdong,

545
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,020
you'll not be used to it.

546
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,260
Don't worry.

547
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,420
I'll get used to it.

548
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,300
I forbid you to get used to it.

549
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,660
Come here.

550
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,140
I've got a wagon full of things for you.

551
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,820
Write to me if you run out of it.

552
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,100
These gold and jewels

553
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,620
should be enough for you for a while.

554
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,220
If you run out of things on the road,

555
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,260
just sell them.

556
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,420
They'll get you some money.

557
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,300
All right.

558
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,780
Just take these for now.

559
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,740
If you bring too much,
people might rob you.

560
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,900
I heard it from Mrs. Mei
that the bitter gourd you have

561
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,540
takes an hour to carve.

562
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,460
I think Shengdong should
have enough bitter gourd.

563
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:31,900
Come here.

564
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,820
Therefore,

565
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,820
I paid him a lump sum for eighty years.

566
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,340
You'll have enough bitter gourds.

567
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,420
And these pens and ink...

568
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,860
I'll practice calligraphy with them.

569
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,820
What calligraphy?

570
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm asking you to write to me.

571
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,100
But keep it simple.

572
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,980
Don't use words I don't understand.

573
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,620
All right.

574
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,620
If you don't understand,

575
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,660
I'll draw something for you.

576
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,460
And this horse.

577
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,300
I named it Douzi.

578
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,380
If you get bored or miss me,

579
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,460
just talk to it.

580
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,500
Don't feed it stinky tofu.

581
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,340
This is the most expensive horse
in the palace.

582
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,940
It has a delicate stomach.

583
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,220
Then I'm leaving.

584
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,060
Mei Daidai,

585
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,020
you're going to use my body

586
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,620
to live the life you want.

587
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,900
Please be happy.

588
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,820
Mei Daidai,

589
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,260
I'm sure we'll meet again.

590
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,460
Shan is already gone.

591
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,820
But why when I see you,

592
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,980
it's like she's not left yet?

593
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,200
[A year later]

594
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,900
Stay away from the chaos of the world

595
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,860
and live a simple life.

596
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,100
There's no prosperity
of the capital here.

597
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,940
But the stars are so bright.

598
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,900
It's been more than a year
since I left the palace.

599
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,540
I wonder

600
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,380
how you two are doing.

601
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,100
Take care.

602
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,660
The moon shines on my bed brightly.

603
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,140
So I mistook it for frost
on the ground.

604
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,180
I gaze at the moonlight
with my head uplifted.

605
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,020
I look down to...

606
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,500
Your Majesty.

607
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,660
Your Majesty.

608
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,340
Your Majesty.

609
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,260
Just rise.

610
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,740
Keep reading.

611
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,180
Hoeing in the paddy
under the mid-day sun.

612
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,540
Sweat drips to the soil
underneath the plant.

613
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,780
- Who knows...
- That's enough.

614
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,820
You're holding the books upside down.

615
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,380
Move your hands away.

616
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,740
- We'll keep reading.
- We'll keep reading.

617
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,500
You're distracting the Empress Dowager.
Be quiet.

618
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,060
It's so beautiful.

619
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,860
Look at that.

620
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,740
Look at that. Look!

621
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,580
So beautiful.

622
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,860
Beautiful.

623
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,620
Very beautiful.

624
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,780
May the country be safe.

625
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,660
May the country be prosperous
and the people be safe.

626
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,500
Live a long and healthy life.

627
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,020
Live a rich and safe life.

628
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,060
