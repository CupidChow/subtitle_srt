00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,900
there will be no one
to look out for you here.

182
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,500
I...

183
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,260
All the more reason for me
to go back home.

184
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,580
We can look out for each other then.

185
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,380
Don't say that again.

186
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,980
Shan.

187
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,020
You have two older brothers.

188
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
If your brothers can find jobs

189
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,820
in the Imperial Court...

190
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,420
I thought father had changed.

191
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,100
But he hasn't changed at all.

192
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,700
Finally,

193
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,220
he got to the point.

194
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,380
Now that you've seen your daughter,

195
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,740
if there's nothing else,

196
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,740
please leave.

197
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,340
You...

198
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,140
What's that attitude?

199
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,180
So disrespectful.

200
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,340
Is she... Is she your maid?

201
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,460
Why does she sound exactly like you?

202
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,460
- I'm furious.
- Just go.

203
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,820
- Just go.
- Find another maid to replace her.

204
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,180
Go.

205
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,340
- Find another maid to replace her.
- This is a girl's room.

206
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,220
You shouldn't stay too long.

207
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,380
Ungrateful kid.

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,820
Leave.

209
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,900
No wonder your mother
and father are a couple.

210
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,300
Those two have a lot in common.

211
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,300
Are you okay?

212
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,220
I'm used to it.

213
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,300
Even though they are my parents,

214
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,100
they never care about me,

215
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
their daughter.

216
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,260
For such a home,

217
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,820
such parents,

218
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,700
and their reputation,
I turned down the man

219
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,100
who treats me sincerely

220
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,900
over and over again.

221
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,900
It's okay.

222
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,220
You still have me.

223
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,500
Young Lady,

224
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,820
are you in there?

225
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,260
Young Lady?

226
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,220
What are you waiting for?

227
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,380
Bring the stuff in now.

228
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,260
Be careful.

229
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,420
She's neither beautiful nor talented.

230
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,020
His Highness will get tired of her
in several days.

231
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,420
Even Huang Yuanyuan

232
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,740
is a much better choice.

233
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,740
Right.

234
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,900
I think so, too.

235
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,380
It annoys me.

236
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,180
I'll go back.

237
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,900
- Bring them in.
- Since the Empress made it official...

238
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,540
Hurry up.

239
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,940
Everyone in the palace
will try to flatter you.

240
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,820
Bear with it.

241
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,740
You may leave.

242
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,460
Young Lady, greetings.

243
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,260
Don't call me that.

244
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
What do you have to say?

245
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,460
The first time you came
to the Guixiu Pavilion,

246
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,380
I was as blind as a bat

247
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,420
and annoyed you.

248
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Young Lady, please spare my life.

249
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,620
So I can

250
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,020
continue serving you.

251
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,060
You can get up.

252
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,100
I knew

253
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,700
that you were a forgiving person.

254
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,820
When I saw you for the first time,

255
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,780
I knew

256
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,940
you must be someone
highly cultured, reasonable,

257
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,140
- and talented...
- Eunuch Song,

258
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,420
you may stop it.

259
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,740
Just tell me

260
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,540
if there's a way I can leave the palace.

261
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,940
Leave?

262
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,780
Young Lady, don't make fun of me.

263
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,260
The Crown Prince
is waiting for the wedding.

264
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,660
You can't leave the palace.

265
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,900
I'm afraid you can't even get off...

266
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,220
It'll be hard for you to do so.

267
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,900
On the contrary,
I must congratulate you, Young Lady.

268
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,620
You don't need
to leave the palace again.

269
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,740
Get out.

270
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,380
Leave.

271
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,700
Get out.

272
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,740
I'll take my leave then.

273
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,100
What?

274
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,420
The Crown Prince will marry
the Grand Chancellor's daughter?

275
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,220
Yes.

276
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,420
I heard the Household Department
had prepared everything.

277
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,220
Guard Xingshi.

278
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,300
Guard Xingshi.

279
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,500
You've been coming
to the Guixiu Pavilion

280
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,980
very often lately.

281
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,860
Yeah.

282
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,180
The wedding is coming.

283
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,140
His Highness is concerned
for the Crown Princess's safety,

284
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,740
so he sent me on a special patrol.

285
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,380
Always the wedding.

286
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,060
I got it.

287
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
- Boring.
- It's vulgar.

288
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,740
Come on. Let's watch this.

289
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,100
The palace is in a hurry
to counteract bad luck.

290
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,380
The wedding which was scheduled
in three months

291
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,740
is now to be held in half a month.

292
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,140
The palace will be heavily guarded.

293
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,340
You'll draw all the attention.

294
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,500
It'll be hard to get out of the palace.

295
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,100
What to do then?

296
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,180
Can your people help?

297
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,580
They're all outside the palace.

298
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,260
But don't worry, Princess.

299
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,140
I'll escort you
out of the palace safely.

300
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,900
After we leave the palace,

301
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,180
we'll talk about what to do next.

302
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,420
Are you coming with us?

303
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,780
I've thought about it.

304
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,340
If Miss Mei
doesn't want to leave secretly,

305
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,180
I'll go to the Grand Chancellor's
Residence personally

306
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,380
to explain who you are to your parents.

307
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,700
Then,

308
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,580
Princess can bid farewell to them

309
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,780
in broad daylight.

310
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,100
I...

311
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,820
I'll go with you.

312
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,220
Really?

313
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,540
You really want to leave with us?

314
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,660
You... You two.

315
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,140
Anyway,

316
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,820
there's nothing left
to be nostalgic about here.

317
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,860
As for the Mei Family,

318
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,860
if it wasn't for the wedding,

319
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,980
I'm afraid they'd have forgotten

320
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,180
they had a daughter.

321
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,100
Don't worry.

322
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I will never let you feel upset again.

323
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,740
Sir,

324
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,780
please give this letter
to the Crown Prince.

325
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,380
Bai Ye.

326
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,820
Be careful.

327
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,620
You sneak up on me like this every time.

328
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,780
You got me again.

329
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,540
Your Highness.

330
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,700
I've brewed a nice pot
of tea waiting for you.

331
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

332
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,220
If you want anything here

333
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
or need anything,

334
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,820
just tell Nanbei.

335
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,220
It's getting cold.

336
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,460
Take care of yourself.

337
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

338
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,620
I've never seen you

339
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,900
look like this.

340
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,500
Did anything happen?

341
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,340
Nothing.

342
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,460
You wanted to see me today

343
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,380
not just to drink some tea, did you?

344
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,180
Just tell me if there's anything.

345
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,780
You should have guessed

346
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,300
what I'm trying to say.

347
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,060
Your Highness,

348
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,140
you can't make her your wife.

349
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,420
Absurd!

350
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,460
What I'm doing now

351
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,260
is all for you, Your Highness.

352
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,980
First, my mother disagrees.

353
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,060
Then the ministers.

354
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,340
And now you're also trying to stop me.

355
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,620
Can't I decide who my wife will be?

356
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,900
Your Highness.

357
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,700
Why do you stop me

358
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,820
from marrying Douzi?

359
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,020
I can't tell you.

360
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,540
Well, answer me then.

361
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,220
Do you like Douzi?

362
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,820
I do.

363
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,500
I have my reason.

364
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,780
Your reason is you don't know

365
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,460
whether to treat me as a friend

366
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,140
or a rival in love, isn't it?

367
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,660
I will ask you one last time.

368
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,140
Douzi refuses to marry me.

369
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,860
Why?

370
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,740
Yes.

371
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,340
I do have a crush on Douzi.

372
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,900
But stopping you from being together

373
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,300
is not for that reason.

374
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,100
Your Highness.

375
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,660
Your Highness.

376
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,420
Leave me alone.

377
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,180
Yes.

378
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,140
I told you to...

379
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,460
Your Highness,

380
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,100
it's Xi sent by Her Majesty

381
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,740
to deliver your wedding clothes.

382
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,540
Her Majesty wants you to try them on.

383
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,340
If they don't fit,

384
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,940
the Household Department will fix them.

385
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,860
I see.

386
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,700
Put them there.

387
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,260
Douzi changed her attitude towards me.

388
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,100
Bai Ye also tried to stop me
from marrying her.

389
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,940
Why?

390
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,900
What secrets do they have?

391
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,060
It seems...

392
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,900
I'll have to ask him.

393
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,620
Dongxi.

394
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,380
Your Highness,

395
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,700
he is here.

396
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,020
I'm sure you know

397
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,820
what I want to ask.

398
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,500
About the assassination
in the Tianji Mansion,

399
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,820
did Bai Ye hide anything from me?

400
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,660
I've said everything I had to say.

401
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,180
Your Highness, no matter how you want
to punish me, just go ahead.

402
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,460
If I remember correctly,

403
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,020
you came to the Tianji Mansion
ten years ago.

404
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,060
You were young and talented.

405
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,620
So they always put you
in important positions.

406
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,740
But you end up in here now.

407
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,180
Do you think it's worth it?

408
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,420
The leading guard of the Tianji Mansion

409
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,980
has been thrown into prison.

410
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,660
Have you ever thought
about your parents out there?

411
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,700
They've always been proud of you.

412
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,300
I have sent someone out of the palace

413
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,020
to deliver money to your parents

414
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,580
along with some warm quilts.

415
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,620
I also gave your best wishes to them.

416
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,900
They are doing okay.

417
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,260
So you don't need to worry.

418
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

419
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,660
If you tell me the truth,

420
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,940
I will resume your post immediately.

421
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,340
Mr. Bai has been gracious to me.

422
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,100
I can't break my promise to him.

423
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,180
I can't tell you.

424
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,460
You think you're protecting him.

425
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,700
But this is a serious matter.

426
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,460
If you insist on hiding the truth,

427
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,260
I'll have to put Bai Ye into jail too.

428
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,300
No.

429
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,420
Your Highness,
don't involve Mr. Bai in this.

430
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,140
If you don't tell the truth,

431
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,260
you'll only hurt him.

432
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,260
What's more important than your lives?

433
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,420
You need to think this through.

434
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,420
I'll tell you.

435
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,180
Mr. Bai has been
hiding something from you.

436
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,980
The maid we were going to kill that day

437
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,620
was...

438
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,900
The Princess of Shengdong.

439
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,820
But Mr. Bai hid the truth

440
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,740
to protect you.

441
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,540
Bai Ye tried to kill Mei Yushan

442
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,460
because she was
the Princess of Shengdong.

443
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,420
But Mei Yushan
is the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

444
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,580
Could it be...

445
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,100
Douzi?

446
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,460
How can I be the one
who destroys my country?

447
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,380
Grand Tutor,

448
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,700
do you also think

449
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,980
that I'll lead Jixi
to its destruction one day?

450
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,500
Then I won't

451
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,780
fall in love
with the Princess of Shengdong.

452
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,780
I won't even fall in love with anyone.

453
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,340
The prophecy won't come true then.

454
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,060
I'll control
thousands of troops in the future.

455
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,860
I can even decide a person's

456
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,620
or even a nation's fate.

457
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,140
But I can't decide who I love or hate?

458
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,700
Do you think if I tell you,

459
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,500
you'll let me go?

460
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,220
You'll just cut my head off.

461
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Even if it means I'll be decapitated,

462
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,580
I can't be with you.

463
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,180
If you leave today,

464
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,380
even if we get married,

465
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,340
I will no longer love you

466
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,020
or see you again.

467
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,020
That would be for the best.

468
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,260
If she is the Princess of Shengdong
who will destroy my country,

469
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,460
why would she say things like that?

470
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,620
Did she finally decide not to hurt me

471
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,380
or...

472
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,100
Did she just find out who she was?

473
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,580
Even though she doesn't mean to hurt me,

474
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,780
now that her identity is revealed,

475
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,740
what should she do?

476
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,860
What should I do?

477
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,660
Sorry to bother you.

478
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,460
By the orders of the Crown Prince,

479
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,900
we need to invite Miss Mei
to the Eastern Palace.

480
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,020
Miss Mei, please.

481
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,900
Strange.

482
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,700
His Highness would not be so impolite.

483
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,540
Seriously?

484
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,740
His Highness couldn't just wait
a few more days?

485
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,780
This class hasn't been over yet.

486
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,500
He just took his wife away.

487
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,660
Yao has gone too much.

488
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,620
He doesn't care about our feelings.

489
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,420
- Exactly.
- Right.

490
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,060
Summoned by the Crown Prince in public,

491
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,660
now she's got something to show off.

492
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,380
I don't think it's that simple.

493
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,180
The guards didn't look like
they came to invite her.

494
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,660
I hope nothing is wrong.

495
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,420
It's...

496
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,340
Guard Xingshi,

497
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,300
has Douzi really been taken
to the Eastern Palace?

498
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,700
She is locked up in the guest room.

499
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,300
Dongxi is guarding the door.

500
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,300
I can't get in, either.

501
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,540
What should we do?

502
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,900
The most important thing now
is to get you out of the palace.

503
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,340
As for the Princess,

504
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,500
I'll find another way.

505
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,180
No.

506
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,300
I can't leave her alone in the palace.

507
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,620
The Crown Prince
must have known something.

508
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,540
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have done this to Douzi.

509
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,100
Let me get you out of here first.

510
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,860
I'm not leaving.

511
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
You have to go.

512
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,180
Let me save one when I can.

513
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,180
Rest assured.

514
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,940
I will escort the Princess

515
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,780
out of the palace safely.

516
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,620
Open the door.

517
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,860
Nangong Yao.

518
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,620
Nangong Yao,

519
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,540
come to see me.

520
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,260
You lock me up just because I don't want
to be the Crown Princess.

521
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,820
What kind of person are you?

522
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,100
Not letting me out of here, right?

523
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,420
Don't you regret it!

524
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,300
I'll smash everything here to pieces.

525
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,460
This must be an antique.

526
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,020
It's certainly not cheap.

527
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,780
This... This at least

528
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
helped me before.

529
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,620
I'll not destroy it.

530
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,980
Don't blame me.

531
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,940
Is there nothing cheap here?

532
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,580
No.

533
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,660
I've already said it.

534
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,660
Now it'd be very embarrassing
not to make some noise.

535
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,100
Miss Mei.

536
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,420
Princess.

537
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,580
I've escorted Mei Yushan
out of the palace.

538
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,620
Don't worry.

539
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,500
I will get you out of here.

540
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,460
Mei Daidai is out of the palace?

541
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,140
Your Highness.

542
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,580
Hasn't she eaten yet?

543
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,060
She cursed the whole day

544
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,580
without eating anything.

545
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,340
Braised meatballs in brown sauce.

546
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,860
She's very important to me.

547
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,340
You must keep her safe.

548
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,260
So I can focus
on getting the Princess out.

549
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,900
What about Douzi?

550
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,860
How to save her?

551
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,940
Secretly gather all the
former subordinates of Shengdong.

552
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,580
Even if it is against the whole Jixi,

553
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,260
I will get the Princess out of there.

554
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,300
- Save the Princess with our lives.
- Save the Princess with our lives.

555
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,180
Have you found out anything
regarding what I asked you about?

556
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,300
I just heard

557
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,220
that the guards of the Eastern Palace

558
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,460
took Miss Mei from the Chongwen Academy.

559
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,780
As for the reason,

560
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,900
I don't know.

561
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,460
Has the Crown Prince
been in the Eastern Palace lately?

562
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,900
He went to the prison once.

563
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,220
The prison?

564
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,580
He was there to interrogate Lingxiao.

565
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,500
Douzi's identity may have been revealed.

566
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,180
The Crown Prince always
cares more about the bigger picture.

567
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,140
Isn't Douzi in danger then?

568
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,660
I must go to the Eastern Palace at once.

569
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,020
Don't worry, Mr. Bai.
Let me ask His Highness first.

570
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,340
I can't believe
I slept through the night.

571
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,100
Is that coward still afraid to meet me?

572
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,900
Wake up, coward.

573
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,620
It's already the daytime.

574
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,740
[Eastern Palace]
I wonder if you dare see me today.

575
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,980
She had a good sleep last night.

576
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,460
But you have a strain
around the shoulder.

577
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,820
I am very worried.

578
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,700
It's no big deal.

579
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,860
By the way,

580
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,100
add one more dish.

581
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,380
Braised meatballs in brown sauce.

582
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,580
Since when do you like that,
Your Highness?

583
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,780
It's too greasy, isn't it?

584
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,340
I will get on it.

585
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,500
Your Highness, Mr. Bai asks to see you.

586
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,140
Let him in.

587
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,410
[Xingqing Hall]

588
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,660
You're here to plead for her?

589
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,820
So you do...

590
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,500
Know all about it.

591
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,860
If I didn't look into it,

592
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,420
how long would you keep it from me?

593
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,340
Now Douzi

594
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,660
is the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

595
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,700
Your Highness,

596
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,900
for the sake of Grand Chancellor Mei,

597
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
please spare her life.

598
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,020
Except for you,

599
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,980
who else knows
about their switching bodies?

600
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,500
Besides Mei Yushan,

601
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,900
I guess now Xingshi knows about it, too.

602
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,860
Xingshi?

603
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,620
Yes.

604
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,780
He didn't tell anyone.

605
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,780
I think it was to protect Mei Yushan.

606
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,660
No wonder he risked himself
to protect Mei Yushan.

607
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,860
Your Highness,

608
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,140
I came in such a hurry today

609
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,820
because I...

610
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,620
Because you worry I'll kill her?

611
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,620
Douzi has also just found out

612
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,380
that she is the Princess of Shengdong.

613
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,220
She came to the palace

614
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,060
to get the pearl
to switch back their bodies,

615
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,980
not to harm you, Your Highness.

616
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,420
But my mother wouldn't think so.

617
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,580
Nor would the ministers.

618
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,820
Your Highness...

619
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,420
What are you going to do with her?

620
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,020
Your Highness.

621
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,460
The wedding has not taken place yet.

622
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
It's not too late
to find another Crown Princess.

623
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
As long as it's not Douzi,

624
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,940
anyone else would be fine.

625
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,660
How dare you!

626
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,700
Your Highness.

627
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,260
Do you really want to kill her?

628
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:33,940
I...

629
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,020
I would never hurt her.

630
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,340
Then why did you lock her up?

631
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,820
Now the whole palace
is talking about it.

632
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,940
They're all wondering

633
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,460
what happened in the Eastern Palace.

634
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,420
Walls have ears.

635
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,420
If Douzi's true identity gets out,

636
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,020
the whole Jixi

637
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,540
will try to get her killed.

638
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,180
Then even if you don't kill her,

639
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,260
she will still die.

640
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,940
She never meant to hurt me.

641
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,580
She has no bad intentions...

642
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,220
And she has protected me several times.

643
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,460
Do you think I'll put her in danger?

644
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,500
Thus...

645
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,060
You keep her in the Eastern Palace...

646
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,660
To keep her safe?

647
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,580
It seems, Your Highness...

648
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,980
You're deeply in love with Douzi.

649
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,420
I've worried too much.

650
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,620
Even so,

651
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,380
Douzi can't stay in the Eastern Palace.

652
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,620
You may not think about yourself.

653
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,060
But shouldn't you think
about the whole country?

654
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,100
I haven't thought about that.

655
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,220
Whatever happens,

656
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,700
there will be a solution.

657
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,460
Your Highness,

658
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,420
the wedding is coming.

659
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,380
To avoid trouble,

660
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,740
I ask you to make your decision soon.

661
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,020
So what do you think...

662
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,220
I should do?

663
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,260
You know

664
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,260
there is danger in front of you.

665
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,780
Why don't stop when you can?

666
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,220
I want to protect you

667
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,100
and protect Douzi.

668
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,060
So I beg of you

669
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,100
to allow me to take Douzi away.

670
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,060
As long as you never
see each other again,

671
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,300
the prophecy of the country's
destruction will be proved wrong.

672
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,980
Is that your brilliant solution, Bai Ye?

673
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,140
Your Highness,

674
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,540
do you have a better solution?

675
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,180
You...

676
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,540
Don't you dare
take her outside the palace!

677
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,700
Between the love of you and Douzi

678
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,620
and the well-being of the whole Jixi,

679
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,820
- Which one is more important...
- Enough!

680
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,060
I'm tired. You may leave.

681
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,940
Your Highness.

682
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,940
Nanbei.

683
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,540
Your Highness.

684
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,980
See him out.

685
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,220
Mr. Bai, please.

686
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,820
Your Highness...

687
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,820
