137
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,060
She's not a servant girl.
She's the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

138
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,220
Why did you carry these here?

139
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,780
That old man is so annoying.

140
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,940
He insists
on lighting a fire in the room.

141
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,060
Go on then.

142
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,780

143
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:43,780

144
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,900
How about

145
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,460
I ask for
the Crown Prince's permission first

146
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,220
and you wait in the side hall?

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,180
Take a right
and then a left along this road.

148
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,300
It's right at the end.

149
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,180
Give me these.

150
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Thank you, Miss.

151
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,700
Where's my lady?

152
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,580
How is she?

153
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,100
She needs to recover
in the Eastern Palace.

154
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

155
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,660
But I'm afraid it's improper.

156
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,620
If my lady stays in the Eastern Palace,

157
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,780
people will start talking.

158
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,700
But she's still in a coma.

159

160
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,140

is also at stake.

168
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,580
and pepper,

169
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,660
it would be so good.

170
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,380
Who says I don't understand?

171
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,580

180
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,940
Of course. I've eaten so many things.

Pupa cicadas.

184
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,980
And even grasshoppers.

185
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,900
These are what poor citizens eat.

186
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,580
Do you also eat those wild things

187
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,700
at the Grand Chancellor's Residence?

188
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,100
I've also eaten snakes and toads.

189
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,220
And unborn chickens.

190
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,340
You also eat unborn chickens?

191
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,740
Dead in the egg?

192
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,580
Wide open eyes?

193
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,420
They also have wings and legs.

194
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,380
Roast them first.

195
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,100
The taste is so much better than eggs.

196
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
You make it sound really tasty.

197
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
I'll have to try it sometime.

198
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,060
You drink this medicine first.

199
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,740
You only need one bowl of my medicine.

200
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,340
I promise, within two days,

201
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,860
you'll be alive and kicking.

202
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,940
Really?

203
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,980
I don't believe it.

204
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,500
Why don't you?

205
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,060
If it's not real,

206
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,460
can I still be an Imperial Physician?

207
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,780
I don't think teaching and medicine are

208
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,100
the same thing.

209
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,300
It's the same.

210
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,500
Scholars in the past
have already told us

211
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,820
that you can find beauty in the books

212
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,020
as well as all the wealth you need.

213
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,380
Different herbs together

214
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,780
will produce a certain drug.

215
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,580
The ancestors
have already put these things

216
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,180
- in the books then.
- Grand Tutor.

217
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,980
Listen to them.

218
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,820
- It can't go wrong.
- Look at my situation.

219
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,140
You still want to give me lessons.

220
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,940
Take your medicine then.

221
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,340
So bitter.

222
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,340
It's killing me in my belly.

223
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,420
Bitter medicine is good medicine.

224
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,580
To be honest with you,
I never gave this to anyone.

225
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
This is my deepest secret.

226
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,300
I didn't even give it to the Empress.

227
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,780
Fine, fine. I'll drink it all.

228
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Not a drop left.

229
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,460
Good.

230
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,420
I need to tell you.

231
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,580
The Crown Prince forced me to come

232
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,860
in the middle of the night.

233
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,500
Baking a midnight snack by his bed,

234
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,460
I must be the first
and only one in the palace.

235
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,980
From today on,

236
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,780
Miss Mei has free access
to the Eastern Palace.

237
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
No one shall stop her.

238
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,500
Look at you.

239
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,620
What a waste this is!

240
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,060
What a waste!

241
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,860
You have no idea.

242
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
With all due respect,

243
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,300
she must stay here today.

244
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,260
If anyone finds out
that she was wounded here,

245
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,740
they will need an explanation.

246
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,460
I guess I didn't think this through.

247
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,020
I'd like to stay and take care of her
in the Eastern Palace.

248
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,140
May as well.

249
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,660
You know her needs better.

250
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,300
I've been wondering

251
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,380
why your lady changed so much

252
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,100
after that night at the Museum.

253
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,100
Did something happen

254
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,060
and I don't know yet?

255
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,420
What Your Highness said

256
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,300
makes no sense to me.

257
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,220
Mei?

258
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,060
Mei.

259
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,100
You woke up already.

260
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,820
Looks like it was right
to get the Grand Tutor.

261
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,660
I will take full responsibility.

262
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,420
Did he give you a hard time?

263
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,140
What?

264
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,860
I mean, you're so busy.

265
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,100
Why are you talking to my servant girl?

266
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,780
My lady, Her Highness was...

267
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,180
We were talking about secrets,
of course.

268
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,140
For example,

269
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,260
someone just had to hold...

270
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,020
Stop.

271
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,060
Hold what?

272
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,900
A... A rabbit.

273
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,020
There was a rabbit in his room.

274
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,980
So many hidden weapons here.

275
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,300
His name shouldn't be Nangong Yao.

276
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,700
It should be Nangong Kill.

277
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,100
Looks like Miss Mei

278
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,580
really likes rabbits.

279
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,220
What about

280
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,700
you hold it again?

281
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,460
Come. Help me back to the bed.

282
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,020
I have a headache.

283
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,900
Does it hurt badly?

284
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,620
Very badly.

285
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,820
It's getting late.

286
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,260
Just stay here and rest.

287
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,940
The pain is too bad.

288
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,860
I'm afraid
I won't be able to leave tonight.

289
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,260
The princess is still alive.

290
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,260
God bless Shengdong.

291
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,900
Leave.

292
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,340
Take the little princess with you.

293
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,100
Go.

294
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,100
Xing Shi.

295
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,420
Get the princess out of here.

296
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,060
Make sure you protect the princess.

297
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,540
Hurry.

298
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,380
Leave.

299
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,100
Father.

300
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,260
Father.

301
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,860
Father!

302
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,340
Father.

303
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,860
Father.

304
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,300
Father, wake up.

305
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,340
Father.

306
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,860
Father.

307
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,060
Father, wake up.

308
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,660
Father.

309
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,620
Father.

310
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,420
Make sure

311
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,140
you protect the princess.

312
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,140
I will.

313
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,780
Father.

314
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,980
Father!

315
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,900
Father.

316
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,340
It's your dying wish.

317
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,900
I swear I'll do my best.

318
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,300
Nangong Yao's name

319
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,780
should be Nangong Kill.

320
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
He plays dirty.

321
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,220
So many hidden weapons to hurt people.

322
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,420
About the Museum,

323
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,180
the Crown Prince found out about it,
but he let it go.

324
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,900
You broke into the Eastern Palace
and triggered the weapons.

325
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,500
He still chose to let it go.

326
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,220
Why did he do that?

327
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,980
He has a guilty conscience.

328
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,900
He's got my Moon Spirit Pearl.

329
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,580
Where do you think
he hid the Moon Spirit Pearl?

330
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,580
Is it still on him?

331
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,300
That was a great chance.

332
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,660
I can't believe I missed it.

333
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
I'll get your medicine.

334
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
I just got scared today.

335
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,420
They believed me.
Do you also believe me?

336
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,980
Look.

337
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,660
Then why do you
keep complaining about the pain

338
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,700
and stay in the Eastern Palace?

339
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,220
I stay here

340
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,340
to get close to the Moon Spirit Pearl.

341
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,540
Don't act rashly.

342
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,180
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

343
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,940
You're worried about me.

344
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
Came looking for me this late.

345
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,740
You're a good friend.

346
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,700
I promise I'll keep this in mind.

347
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,300
Sit up.

348
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,580
Don't rub around.

349
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
Sleep well and heal well.

350
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,740
We'll find the Moon Spirit Pearl later.

351
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,860
Let's sleep. Come on.

352
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,020
Promise me.

353
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,820
My dear friend, I promise you.

354
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,340
Stop lecturing me and go to bed.

355
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,780
When did you get here?

356
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,900
One moment ago.

357
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,900
I saw you reading the book and laughing.

358
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
I didn't disturb you.

359
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,180
What is this?

360
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Water with sugar.

361
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,380
Leave me.

362
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,900
Hold on.

363
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,980
Did you

364
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
also send such water to others?

365
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
Others?

366
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,340
You mean Miss Mei?

367
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,460
Is she asleep now?

368
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,620
Did she take the medicine
the Grand Tutor left?

369
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,860
The medicine has been taken.

370
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,260
The lights are also out
in Miss Mei's room.

371
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,580
Okay.

372
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,860
Leave me now.

373
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,200
[Xingqing Hall

374
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,580
Douzi.

375
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Douzi.

376
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,780
Douzi?

377
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,260
Maybe it's hidden in his clothes.

378
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,820
I'm just looking for the pearl.

379
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,060
Not touching him on purpose.

380
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
You... You weren't asleep?

381
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,300
Even your wound couldn't stop you.

382
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,140
Sneaking into my room
in the middle of the night.

383
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,700
I... I came to find the pearl.

384
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,580
You said you'd give me the pearl.

385
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,500
But I still don't have it.

386
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,060
When will you give it to me?

387
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,220
You broke into the Eastern Palace
repeatedly for that pearl.

388
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,820
You almost lost your life today.

389
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,700
Tell me.

390
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,580
Why do you have to get this pearl back?

391
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,220
I told you my friend had hysteria.

392
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,340
So much time has passed.

393
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,620
Haven't you come up with something new?

394
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Why do you keep refusing
to give it back to me?

395
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,860
It's just an ordinary pearl to you.

396
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,780
But for me, it can really save lives.

397
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,220
Even if it doesn't save lives,

398
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,620
it belongs to the Family Mei.

399
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,900
Why can't I get it back?

400
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,620
Why?

401
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,940
Why can't I?

402
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,740
If this pearl
really belongs to the Mei Family,

403
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,820
you people
have committed a serious crime.

404
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,900
What crime?

405
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,540
It belonged to Shengdong.

406
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,700
What?

407
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,020
Miss,

408
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,860
am I hurting you?

409
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,060
Then I'll let go.

410
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,340
You promise not to scream.

411
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,820
I'm sorry

412
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
I offended you.

413
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,180
I have something to tell you.

414
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,140
Close the door first.

415
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,980
Douzi's got pretty strong hands.

416
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,700
So strong.

417
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,460
I really didn't know
it belonged to Shengdong.

418
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,540
I need that pearl to...

419
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,460
You want something
from Shengdong so badly.

420
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,300
How do you think I feel about that?

421
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,180
I swear,

422
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,060
I only need this pearl for...

423
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,060
Little Master, are you thirsty?

424
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,140
I'll get you some water.

425
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,460
We gave the Family Mei a lot of power.

426
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,500
Yet you betrayed your country
and conspired with the enemies.

427
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,900
- Tomorrow I will order...
- No, you can't.

428
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,220
The Moon Spirit Pearl
doesn't belong to the Family Mei.

429
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,140
It has nothing
to do with the Family Mei.

430
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,500
I'll tell you the truth.
You have to believe me.

431
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,420
About the Moon Spirit Pearl...

432
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,260
Well...

433
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,780
I was going to leave

434
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,020
after I got the pearl.

435
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,980
But then you asked me to pour you wine.

436
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,980
You know what happened afterward.

437
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,220
Mei Yushan and I

438
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,740
switched bodies
on the day of the lunar eclipse.

439
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,020
The pearl somehow went to the sky

440
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,780
and then it started to shine.

441
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,660
I thought you were someone
who has dignity and manners.

442
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,220
I didn't know that you would drag people

443
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,300
into your room when drunk.

444
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,140
Please forgive me.

445
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,860
I swear I'm not a frivolous person.

446
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,700
I really had no choice.

447
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,700
Otherwise, I'd never offend you.

448
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,140
Go on.

449
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,940
On what did you have no choice?

450
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,460
Is there any other reason

451
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,100
for you to come into the palace?

452
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,820
What do you mean?

453
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,340
So I am right.

454
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,180
Then I'm relieved.

455
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,940
What are you trying to say?

456
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,140
I already guessed

457
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,460
that all this time surviving alone,

458
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,460
you must've experienced
some of the worst things in the world

459
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,980
and mastered the way to survive.

460
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
All these years,

461
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,140
you must have suffered a lot.

462
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,460
Well, it's been rough.

463
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,180
But I brought it on myself.

464
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,100
Rest assured.

465
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,420
I'll take care of you from now on.

466
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,580
Nothing bad
will ever happen to you again.

467
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,620
You sound so weird.

468
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,180
Who are you really?

469
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,860
When I woke up again,

470
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,260
I became like this.

471
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,460
Mei Yushan and I

472
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,460
switched bodies for some reason.

473
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,060
Little Master,

474
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,700
don't you find this thing strange

475
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,980
and hard to believe?

476
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,180
It is strange.

477
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,780
I'm sure it took you a lot of effort

478
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,180
to come up with this story.

479
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,900
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

480
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,020
You think I'm a traitor
when I don't tell the truth.

481
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,100
And when I do, you don't believe me.

482
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,140
What should I do to get my pearl back?

483
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,940
In my twenty years of life,

484
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,940
I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

485
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:37,940
Fine.

486
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,020
You say you're a thief.

487
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,660
What proof do you have?

488
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,820
Come here.

489
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,740
It's...

490
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,740
Don't get so close to me.

491
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,580
Now you believe me?

492
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,340
Ridiculous.

493
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,740
I can't believe
you really know how to steal.

494
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,740
I only steal.

495
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,060
I don't do any other bad things.

496
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,620
Tell me if you believe me now.

497
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,500
You're indeed different

498
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,820
before and after you came to the palace.

499
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,860
In that case,

500
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,420
your real name is Douzi?

501
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,980
You finally believe me.

502
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,500
I got so anxious.

503
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,260
I thought
as the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

504
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,620
I would have good food,
good drink and a good life.

505
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,900
I didn't know there were so many rules.

506
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,020
Take small bites. Take small steps.

507
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,140
I even have to
go to the stupid school to study.

508
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,660
Do you know

509
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,340
that I never had to study before?

510
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
During those lectures,

511
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,940
people laugh at me.

512
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,380
Your Highness?

513
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,780
Your Highness.

514
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,300
Who's out there?

515
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,380
I heard something in your room.

516
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,460
It's all right. Leave me.

517
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,620
Yes.

518
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,420
What are you still doing here?

519
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,260
You wish to sleep with me?

520
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,060
I should have recognised you

521
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,740
the first time we met.

522
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,460
You have your mother, Empress Li's eyes.

523
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,700
They look exactly the same.

524
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,220
Empress Li?

525
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,100
What are you talking about?

526
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,500
Well, forget it.

527
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,940
You don't trust me right now.

528
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,820
Let's just say I'm drunk and rambling.

529
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,340
But one day

530
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,260
you'll trust me.

531
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,820
Since you're just rambling, then stop.

532
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,740
If you try it again,

533
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,140
I'll report this
to His Highness immediately.

534
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,660
Take your time.

535
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,660
Untie yourself somehow.

536
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,820
[Eastern Palace]

537
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,260
You have your mother, Empress Li's eyes.

538
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,460
They look exactly the same.

539
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,700
Are you feeling better?

540
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,020
You know what?

541
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,220
The Grand Tutor's medicine works.

542
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,660
It's almost healed.

543
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,140
Don't go to school today.

544
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,540
In case they notice your injuries
and we have to explain.

545
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,020
Let them ask.

546
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,940
I haven't done anything wrong.

547
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,220
By the way,

548
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,260
where did you go last night?

549
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,540
I didn't see you in the room.

550
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,580
Where did you go?

551
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,900
I...

552
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
I...

553
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,820
I told the Crown Prince the truth.

554
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,140
The Moon Spirit Pearl
belonged to Shengdong.

555
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,100
I begged for it several times.

556
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,580
He suspects your family is
conspiring with the enemy.

557
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,020
I had no choice.

558
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,860
I could only tell him the truth.

559
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,460
Did he believe you?

560
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,060
I don't know.

561
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,500
I came back yesterday in a blur.

562
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,220
I don't know what he really thinks.

563
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,220
The Crown Prince is very cautious.

564
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,220
I'm sure he'll ask you about it again.

565
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,300
Don't worry. It won't hurt your family.

566
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,100
Douzi.

567
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,060
How come

568
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,180
I've never heard you
talk about your mother?

569
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,020
My mother?

570
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,100
Which one do you mean?

571
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,660
You have several mothers?

572
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
So many.

573
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,780
I had a Milk Nurse when I was little.

574
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,380
She always spanked me.

575
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,660
I called her Mother Zhu.

576
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,100
Then she'd stop hitting me.

577
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,660
My First Father

578
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,820
had a lover.

579
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,060
She always did my laundry.

580
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,820
I'd call her Mother Chen.

581
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,500
And then there was this Mrs. Zhang

582
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,260
who loved swearing.

583
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,180
She always gave me roast chicken feet.

584
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,180
I called her Mother Zhang.

585
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,260
When she got happy,

586
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,660
I'd have chicken feet to eat.

587
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,860
I meant

588
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,340
your real mother.

589
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,500
Real mother.

590
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,340
I don't have a real mother.

591
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
My fathers told me

592
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,980
when I was little,

593
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,620
I was left by someone

594
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,780
in a wooden box in
the middle of nowhere.

595
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,740
I don't know who my parents are.

596
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,020
Do your three fathers

597
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,420
treat you well?

598
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,100
Not too bad.

599
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,060
You know,
sometimes we don't have any food.

600
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,820
They'd take me to steal some.

601
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,740
I'll be there for you.

602
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,020
You won't have to steal anymore.

603
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,980
Even after we switch back our bodies,

604
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,060
you can stay with me.

605
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,260
I would treat you like my sister.

606
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,340
If you don't like it here in the palace,

607
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,540
I'll send you out.

608
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,220
If you want,

609
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,860
you can stay in my residence forever.

610
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,260
I'll tell my father and mother
to treat you well.

611
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,220
Your residence?

612
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,820
I haven't traveled the world yet.

613
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,940
And I wonder

614
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,020
how my fathers are doing now.

615
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,140
This way.

616
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,020
Okay.

617
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,620
Two guys over here.

618
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,380
Coming.

619
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,660
Catch.

620
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,500
Slow down.

621
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,980
Help me.

622
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,780
Be careful.

623
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,260
Okay.

624
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,620
Carry this over there with me.

625
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,500
All right.

626
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,700
In one, two.

627
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
Give me a hand.

628
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,540
Slowly.

629
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,100
Hurry up.

630
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,420
Don't waste time. Carefully.

631
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,260
Sir.

632
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,020
Sir.

633
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,580
- Peace brings money.
- Hurry up.

634
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,100
Peace brings money.

635
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,180
Hurry up.

636
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Slow down.

637
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,180
Hand me that.

638
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,020
Right.

639
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,620
Let's get this up.

640
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,780
Help me.

641
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,540
Stop pretending.

642
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,220
It's so annoying.

643
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,260
You said...

644
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,660
We'd see Douzi here.

645
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,860
It turned out

646
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,500
we didn't even get into the palace.

647
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:33,900
Well...

648
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,540
Stop arguing. Don't worry.

649
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,660
I saw some officers

650
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,100
went over there
with two jars of alcohol.

651
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,220
They're going to get drunk tonight.

652
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,660
Let's take the opportunity to...

653
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,740
Yu, do you mean

654
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,540
we escape?

655
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,380
Exactly.

656
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,820
Hold on.

657
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,140
We all sleep in a large bunk.

658
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,260
If we get up at midnight,

659
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,780
someone will find out.

660
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,420
I really wonder what you have

661
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,220
in your brain.

662
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,420
If anyone asks,

663
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,980
just say you need to pee.

664
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,340
No one cares about your pee.

665
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,380
We split up.

666
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,820
Wait for my signal.

667
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,860
Someone, come here.

668
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,980
Yu, you're right.

669
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,540
And over here.

670
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,340
Listen to me.

671
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,260
Tonight,

672
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,780
we do like this...

673
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,780
Come here!

674
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,340
Come on. Try harder.

675
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,980
Move it up.

676
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,460
These guys are really suspicious.

677
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,060
- All right.
- Higher here.

678
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,460
We stick to the plan.

679
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,180
We set a trap tonight.

680
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,180
And then you let everyone

681
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,660
in the Imperial Court know

682
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,940
that they hired some fake refugees.

683
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,300
The Crown Prince is in charge of hiring.

684
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,620
When the news gets out,

685
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,660
he will be humiliated.

686
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,460
In the Relief Organization situation,

687
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,420
the Crown Prince ordered

688
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,100
to raid two officers' houses.

689
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,220
These two officers
worked for Lord Liu Qinyuan.

690
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,980
This time, Lord Liu

691
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,860
has decided to mess
with the Crown Prince.

692
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,660
Come on. Over here.

693
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,420
I got the material.

694
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,980
Let's go.

695
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,300
[Xingqing Hall]

696
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,820
Mei Yushan and I

697
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,340
switched bodies
on the day of the lunar eclipse.

698
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,620
The pearl somehow went to the sky

699
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,380
