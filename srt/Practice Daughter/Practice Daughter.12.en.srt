00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,940
It's been several times.

184
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,980
Give it back.

185
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,740
So annoying.

186
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,820
Don't be upset.

187
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,020
Why hasn't the Grand Tutor come yet?

188
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,260
- When will he be here?
- Keep it secret.

189
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,940
Stop talking.

190
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,580
Miss Mei, His Highness guessed
that you like something thrilling.

191
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,700
So he hid the gift

192
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,060
for you to find.

193
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,500
He even drew a treasure map.

194
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,500
Finding treasures is a lot more fun
than unpacking.

195
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,450
[Imperial Garden]

196
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,420
[Look up]

197
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,200
[Limbo]

198
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,300
Limbo?

199
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,420
I don't want to go
to the Limbo.

200
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,420
[Limbo]
Little Master is so abnormal.

201
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,460
Concubines who once died here,

202
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,900
I'm just here looking for something.

203
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,620
I'll leave as soon as I get my stuff.

204
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,060
I'm quite shy.

205
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,620
Please don't come out and greet me.

206
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,900
Please, please.

207
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,180
What on earth is the treasure?

208
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,060
Why does it have to be hidden
in this place?

209
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,740
Where is it?

210
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,740
You almost scared me to death.

211
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,940
I just came to take a nap.

212
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,820
Please don't tell anyone.

213
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,180
You don't work in broad daylight,

214
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,860
and you're slacking off here?

215
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,420
Does Little Master want
to scare me to death?

216
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,260
Where is it?

217
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,340
Since he planned a treasure hunt,

218
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,700
the gift wouldn't be
in such a conspicuous place, would it?

219
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,220
I knew it. It's just a stupid rope.

220
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,700
Will the treasure fall once I pull this?

221
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,380
Little Master.

222
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,740
What exactly did you prepare for me?

223
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,780
So hard to find.

224
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,940
It's this very special rope.

225
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,620
Even knives and fire

226
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,420
can't destroy it.

227
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,420
How about this one?

228
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,020
This one...

229
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,620
I suppose

230
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,900
one of the concubines
hanged herself with it.

231
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,620
[Guixiu Pavilion]

232
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,860
Little Master.

233
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,820
Never mind.

234
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,420
Douzi.

235
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,700
Never mind.

236
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,740
- Little Master.
- Douzi.

237
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,540
After you.

238
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,500
Mei Yushan and I are going
to switch bodies on the full moon.

239
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,220
So I'll be staying in the palace
for ten more days.

240
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,620
What were you saying?

241
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,900
I wanted to ask you about this.

242
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,900
After leaving the palace,

243
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,300
do not steal again.

244
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,340
I have planned everything

245
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,300
for you and your life.

246
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,740
What do you mean?

247
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,580
Do you think I can't live a good life
on my own?

248
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,940
- No...
- Your Highness.

249
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,500
I didn't know you were coming.

250
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,540
Sorry, I wasn't prepared.

251
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,860
Tomorrow, the Empress
is leaving the palace.

252
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,100
I will accompany you and Her Majesty

253
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,220
then.

254
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,660
Thank you, Eunuch Song.

255
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,860
Then I'll take my leave.

256
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,020
In two days, my mother and I

257
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,860
will go to Chengbi Temple
to redeem a vow to the Immortals.

258
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,580
If you need anything,

259
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,380
just ask Nanbei to give me a message.

260
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,340
Chengbi Temple?

261
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,860
I used to go there when I was a kid.

262
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,060
Really?

263
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,700
You like to make wishes there, too?

264
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,220
How could I tell you

265
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,940
that I was there to steal the offerings?

266
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,100
I wonder what they are learning today

267
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,540
at the Chongwen Academy,

268
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,220
and if Douzi gets into any trouble.

269
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,620
What Douzi?

270
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,220
It's Miss Mei.

271
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,300
A nickname.

272
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,380
Nanbei.

273
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,220
Yes.

274
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,100
I need you to return to the palace

275
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,500
and check on Douzi.

276
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,180
Yes.

277
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,900
Besides,

278
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
there is a jujube cake shop
at the entrance of the temple.

279
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,340
Buy some for her.

280
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,100
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,780
Hold on.

282
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,820
Your Highness.

283
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,980
Also, ask her

284
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,580
how her sleep was last night.

285
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,700
Yes.

286
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,180
Hurry up.

287
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,420
In about three or four days,

288
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,980
it'll be a full moon night.

289
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,540
Can the moon not become full?

290
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
If it can be,

291
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,300
someone will stay in the palace.

292
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,380
When will the rain stop?

293
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,980
So annoying.

294
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,260
Had it not been for the delay
from the Grand Tutor,

295
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,620
we'd have been long gone by now.

296
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,780
Yeah.

297
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,380
It rains heavily.

298
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,100
- When do you think...
- Whatever...

299
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,060
- it'll stop?
- I'm sleepy.

300
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,740
I'll take a nap.

301
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,420
I'm going to do the same.

302
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,380
If you all take a nap,

303
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,660
I guess I'll do it, too.

304
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm bored. Talk to me.

305
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,700
Come on, just for a while.

306
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,740
Wake up!

307
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,860
We must not waste

308
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,260
our youth on sleeping.

309
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,260
Get up.

310
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,180
- What are you doing?
- Get up.

311
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,900
- How can we sleep like this?
- Get up and have fun.

312
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,220
What fun?

313
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,460
- It's daytime...
- So noisy.

314
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,380
Get up! Have fun!

315
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,300
- So annoying.
- The rain has kept us here.

316
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,100
What else can we do?

317
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,460
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

318
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,060
Let's play games and have fun.

319
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,300
- What game?
- What game?

320
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,060
Questions and Answers.

321
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,540
Come here!

322
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,420
Come on.

323
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,900
You go over there.

324
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,340
Yao goes first then.

325
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,220
- Okay
- Okay.

326
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,340
Your Highness, you go first.

327
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,860
- Come on, Your Highness.
- Come on, Your Highness.

328
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,580
I forgot the bag. I'll go get it.

329
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,860
Uhh...

330
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,100
Your Highness,
you got up so early today?

331
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,340
Why don't you call me Little Master?

332
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,300
I can tell that you are in a bad mood.

333
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm afraid if I say anything wrong,

334
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,260
I will be beheaded.

335
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,020
All this time the palace,

336
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,500
what's your favorite gift
you've received?

337
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,100
Gift?

338
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,420
It must be the rope I gave her.

339
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,140
I really like the painting of stars

340
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,100
that Mr. Bai gave me.

341
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,300
About what you said yesterday,

342
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,260
did you mean it?

343
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,580
Mean it?

344
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,740
All this time in the palace,

345
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,300
is there anything
that makes you extremely happy?

346
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,540
The other day,
in the back garden of the Academy,

347
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,500
I received what I've always wanted.

348
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,340
It made me happy.

349
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,740
Of course, I meant it.

350
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,060
All this time in the palace,

351
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,540
is there anyone special to you?

352
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,660
Mei is very special.

353
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,820
You can't choose her
cause she entered the palace with you.

354
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,580
Then it would be you, Your Highness.

355
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,220
- Why?
- Well...

356
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,900
Your Highness, you are a righteous man.

357
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,180
You are a very good friend.

358
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,580
I can't believe you call me a friend.

359
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,660
So,

360
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,420
you really meant it.

361
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,140
Well, Little Master,

362
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,380
what are you trying to say?

363
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm trying to say...

364
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,980
Yesterday in class,

365
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,420
the Grand Tutor talked
about The Southerners.

366
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,370
There was a sentence,

367
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,900
"Branches cuddle up
to the mountain's trees."

368
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,700
Do you remember
what the next sentence is?

369
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,460
I... Uhh...

370
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
What branches and trees?

371
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,380
I don't understand a word of it.

372
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,260
Fool.

373
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,340
The next sentence is,
"But you know not how much I love thee."

374
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,140
I want to tell you...

375
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,420
Let me tell you a story.

376
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,740
I have a friend.

377
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,100
One day he found an injured duckling.

378
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,700
He took good care of it.

379
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,740
And then the duckling suddenly

380
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,700
got better.

381
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,900
It means

382
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,460
it's about to go back to its own pond.

383
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,100
Then let it go back.

384
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,020
But it breaks my heart...

385
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,820
But it breaks my friend's heart

386
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,180
to let it go.

387
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,620
Why?

388
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,420
Your friend wants
to make it into a roast duck?

389
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,420
If he doesn't want to eat it,

390
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,860
then just let it go back.

391
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,980
It has its own ideas.

392
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,180
It'll be very happy
to be back in its pond.

393
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,260
Just like me.

394
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,260
I don't want to stay in this palace,
either.

395
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,740
But he thought

396
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,340
he had a connection with the duckling.

397
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,420
I'm afraid it was all just an act.

398
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,140
If the duck showed no feelings,

399
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,740
it would have been a dish already.

400
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,780
I see.

401
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,300
It turns out that all along,

402
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,700
it was only an imagination

403
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,620
in my friend's head.

404
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,020
It must have been the case.

405
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,980
You don't go to class today?

406
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,120
[Xingqing Hall]

407
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,780
Your Highness.

408
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
Have some breakfast.

409
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,220
Your Highness.

410
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,700
[Eastern Palace]

411
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,460
Zuo.

412
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,620
He hasn't eaten all day.

413
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,780
Is he still asleep?

414
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,540
Yeah.

415
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,580
I'm worried sick.

416
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,220
Now he won't even let me in.

417
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,620
You may leave now.

418
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,300
Let's go.

419
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,340
Hasn't he eaten yet?

420
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,170
[Eastern Palace]

421
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,620
Your Highness.

422
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,020
You finally came out.

423
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,620
I was worried sick.

424
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,060
What time is it?

425
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,460
Your Highness,

426
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,940
it's a quarter past Chen hour.

427
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,740
Bring me all the memorials
I didn't read yesterday.

428
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,100
[Xingqing Hall]
But you have not had breakfast yet.

429
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,820
Hand the memorials.

430
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,420
Put them inside.

431
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,900
I was just kidding.

432
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,140
- Why so serious?
- How dare you!

433
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,780
- You can't reach me.
- Don't you dare laugh at me.

434
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,940
- Come on.
- I'll give you a lesson.

435
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,340
You can't.

436
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,220
Don't hide if you dare.

437
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,460
Block her for me.

438
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,740
Nobody is helping you.

439
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,900
Stop it.

440
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,580
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,660
All right, all right.

442
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,820
I will hit you.

443
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,060
Stop.

444
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,380
Little Master.

445
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,340
It hurts.

446
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,100
I was wrong, seriously.

447
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,620
The more you try,
the more annoyed he'll be.

448
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,580
The Crown Prince will not be interested

449
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,020
in a wild girl like her.

450
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,620
Yao, you're here.

451
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,220
Your Highness.

452
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,260
Have you been studying hard lately?

453
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,940
Of course.

454
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,820
Now turn to page twenty-eight
of the Chongwen Collection.

455
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,100
Little Master,

456
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,820
use mine.

457
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,260

458
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,780
lend me your book.

459
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,860
Here, Yao.

460
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,700
Lift your right foot.

461
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,220
Chest out and head up.

462
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,300
Left foot.

463
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,340
- Here we go.
- Finally over.

464
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,900
Let's play football.

465
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,460
Slow down.

466
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
- Okay.
- Let's go.

467
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,820
I really couldn't focus today.

468
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,900
Princes and ladies,

469
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,580
let's go over yesterday's lesson.

471
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,500
Mei Yushan!

472
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,140
Mei Yushan.

473
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,860
Answer me.

474
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,580
What is the next sentence of

475
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,780
"Branches cuddle up
to the mountain's trees."

476
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,980
Roast duck with fruit wood is the best.

477
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,740
Roast duck?

478
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,980
So funny. Always about food.

480
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,700
Miss Mei.

481
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,780
I came to bring His Highness a drink.

482
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Thank you.

483
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,540
His Highness has got
excessive internal heat these days.

484
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,340
I just made the mung bean soup

485
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,100
which could make him feel better.

486
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,340
Please deliver this
to His Highness for me.

487
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,940
Miss Mei, you can deliver it
to him yourself.

488
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,020
His Highness is in the room.

489
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,140
- I'm not going inside.
- Who's out there?

490
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,900
Your Highness,

491
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
it's Miss Mei.

492
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,900
I'm not going in.

493
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,060
Give this to His Highness for me.

494
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,660
Thank you. See you.

495
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,340
Miss Mei.

496
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,740
Did Little Master drink it or not?

497
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,500
Let's drink it here.

498
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,020
He gave my mung bean soup
to someone else?

499
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,700
- How do you feel?
- I've been taking it for three days.

500
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,540
But it doesn't work at all.

501
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,540
Oh no.

502
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,100
Maybe you can try another medication?

503
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,020
You delivered the mung bean soup today.

504
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,300
Did the Crown Prince say anything?

505
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,100
I think Little Master

506
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,900
kind of hates me now.

507
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,580
But I thought about it.

508
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,780
I didn't do anything to annoy him.

509
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,700
Do you think

510
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,740
it's because he knows that I'm a thief,

511
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,820
he despises me now?

512
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,380
So what if you're a thief?

513
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
You haven't done anything terrible,
have you?

514
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,860
You are not a bad person.

515
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,220
Then...

516
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,580
Maybe he thinks

517
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,260
I was taking advantage of your identity
to approach him?

518
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,340
Nonsense.

519
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,460
All this time in the palace,

520
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,980
you've been trying hard
to get the pearl back for us.

521
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,820
He knows about it.

522
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
We switched bodies by accident.

523
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,340
If you wanted to use my body

524
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,940
to gain power,

525
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,340
you wouldn't have come
to the Relief Organization to save me.

526
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,980
Mei Daidai,

527
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,420
do you really think so?

528
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,260
I'm in your body now.

529
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,140
I know you very well, Douzi.

530
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,380
Why am I so sad?

531
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,700
Being able to leave here,

532
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,020
I should be feeling happy.

533
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,380
What am I sad about?

534
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,660
Mei Daidai.

535
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,740
After I leave the palace,

536
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,620
will I see you again?

537
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,820
If you miss me,

538
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,780
you can find me at my residence.

539
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,420
I won't study in the palace forever.

540
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,900
I'll leave the palace, too.

541
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,740
But your residence has such high walls.

542
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,620
Then do what you're best at.

543
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,260
If you can't climb it,

544
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,380
I'll go meet you in the Black Dog Alley.

545

00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,020
it'll be a full moon night.

553
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,820
Maybe we can invite Miss Mei over

554
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,300
while it is such a beautiful night.

555
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,860
It is beautiful...

556
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,100
What are you doing?

557
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,220
You just had to mention that.

558
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,180
Don't you know
that His Highness and Miss Mei

559
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,340
are on bad terms?

560
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,420
I'm trying to fix things up.

561
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,700
You're unbelievable.

562
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,980
Go ahead and light a charcoal stove.

Your Highness,
do you think this is enough?

573
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,820
And the rest?

574
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,020
Osmanthus cake, chestnut cake,
and jujube paste cake.

575
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,540
Pastries.

576
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
- Five more boxes of pastries.
- Yes.

577
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,260
Your Highness, how long is the journey?

578
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,180
I wonder if this will be too much.

579
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,260
With her big appetite,

580
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,860
we don't need to worry about it.

582
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,100
Keep an eye on them these days.

583
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,340
If Miss Mei

584
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,860
or her maid wants to leave the palace,

585
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,100
you have to escort them yourself.

586
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,900
Yes.

587
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,980
Someone will be waiting for you
outside the palace.

588
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,980
Take this with you.

589
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,140
The guards at the gate
will allow you to leave.

590
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,540
Yes, Your Highness.

591
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,380

592
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,420
Your Highness?

593
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,900
You may go.

594
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,860
Yes.

595
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,620
Your Highness,
I will get the pastries ready.

596
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,780

I don't know when I'll see you again.

601
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,340
It's glowing.

602
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,580
It wasn't glowing last time.

603
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,500
I'm sure this will work today.

604
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,180
Why haven't we switched bodies yet?

605
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,900
Maybe we can hold the pearl together.

606
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,500
