42

she'll definitely go
to the Huacai Hall to...

44
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,260
I'm already here.

- Only then can I rest assured.
- Your Majesty.

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
not only went to the Eastern Palace

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,540
but also came here to find me.

57

Are you okay?

58
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,100

00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,420
Why did you bring her here?

She is... She...

62
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,620
It's hard to explain.

63
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,100
Simply speaking,

64
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,140
we must come to the palace together.

65
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,220
Otherwise, we'll both be in trouble.

66
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,260
Be honest with me.

67
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,660

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,420
No. No.

69
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,140
She can't threaten me.

70
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,580
It should be the other way around.

71
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,180
Why do you talk and behave

72
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,180

73
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,020
Oh... By the way,

74
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,620
what's in this box?

75
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,420
I almost forgot.

76
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:29,900
What is it?

77
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,260
It's all your favorite food.

78
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,460
Here.

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,580
What is this?

80
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,340
It is a Stewed Melon with Longjing Tea.

81
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,540
What melon? What tea?

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,420
It's premature melon.

83
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,620
After soaking in the spring water
the whole day,

84
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,660
it is then stewed
with West Lake's Longjing tea

85
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,380
for the time of a stick of incense.

86
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,420
Finally, drizzle it with sesame oil.

87
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,820

Isn't this bitter gourd?

91
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,900
It's premature melon.

92
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,660
This used to be your favorite food.

93
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,660
You haven't had it for a while.
Are you not used to it anymore?

94
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,140
Have some more.

95
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,940
I'm not hungry right now.

96
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,420
It's not easy for you
to come to the palace.

97
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,940
Have some to gain more energy.

98
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,620
I can eat all this stuff
whenever I want.

99
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,420
You have some.

100
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,140
One must respect seniority.

101
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,500
You go first.

102
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,940
Go ahead.

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
Here.

104
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,740
Have some.

106
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,020
You have some.

107
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,820
You have some first.

108
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
If you don't eat, I'll be mad.

109
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,060
I especially prepared this for you.

110
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,260
Tasty.

111
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,780
Very delicious.

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,460
By the way,

113
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,340
it's been a while
since you came to the palace.

114
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,620
Why is there still no news?

115
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,700
What news?

116
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,740
I noticed that Her Majesty

117
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,380
doesn't like you very much.

118
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,420
How can you become
the Crown Princess like this?

119
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,300
The Crown Princess?

120
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,740
Don't forget what your father told you

121
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,980
before you left for the palace.

122
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,780
You have two older brothers back home

123
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,460
who have always been good kids.

124
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,980
If you can be the Crown Princess,

125
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,060
you'll be able to help them one day.

126
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,100
Stop it.

127
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,340
So you ask Mei Yushan
to come to the palace

128
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,660
for that purpose.

129
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,500
That's also for your own good.

130
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,500
You...

131
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,820
Are you really going to use Shan

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,220
to gain glory for the Mei Family?

133
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,940
She said that for me.

134
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,700
Shan.

135
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,660
I'm sad to hear you say that.

136
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,460
Mulan joined the army for her father.

137
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,380
Zhaojun married a foreigner
for her country.

138
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,660
I am simply asking you

139
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,940
to help your brothers
get a brighter future.

140
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,260
There's nothing wrong with that.

141
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,460
Mulan joined the army
because her father was old.

142
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,500
Zhaojun's marriage was also absurd.

143
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,660
A country actually

144
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,940
asked a woman
to take all the responsibilities.

145
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,500
The Western Han Dynasty
gained peace through that.

146
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,540
But no one cared about

147
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,740
whether the bride was scared and upset.

148
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,340
You've taught Shan how to write
and play the guqin

149
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,060
since she was a child.

150
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,380
Is it only to ask Shan

151
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,900
to sacrifice herself
to support her brothers?

152
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,220
I didn't say that.

153
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,900
She said it for me.

154
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,180
Anyway.

155
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,660
Millions of women

156
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,500
have done such things before.

157
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,420
So your daughter

158
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,220
has to repeat someone else's tragedy?

159
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,540
Exactly.

160
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,060
Shan, listen.

161
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,860
The Crown Prince is intelligent,
upright,

162
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,140
and handsome.

163
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,060
I really don't understand

164
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,380
what's so wrong with you marrying him.

165
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,220
No.

166
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,900
Marriage should happen
between two people in love.

167
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,820
I said all I had to say.

168
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,260
It's getting late. I need to go home.

169
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,580
Now you know why my parents
asked me to enter the palace.

170
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,220
Will you despise me?

171
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,660
Nonsense.

172
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,220
How could I despise you?

173
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,620
I actually envy you.

174
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,940
In fact,

175
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,940
I envy you,

176
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,340
because your mother

177
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,500
comes to visit you when you're ill.

178
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,100
What's wrong?

179
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,380
When I was a child,

180
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,700
I always asked my three fathers

181
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,340
about my mother's identity

182
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,660
and her appearance.

183
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,260
They all got tired of me.

184
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
So they'd avoid me.

185
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,820
I just wanted to know who I really was.

186
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,740
I wanted to know

187
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,500
if it was really like what others said

188
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,580
that because my mother didn't like me
and hated me,

189
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,700
she abandoned me.

190
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,900
These awful people.

191
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,940
I am here for you.

192
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,100
No one can ever hurt you again.

193
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,420
I will be there for you, too.

194
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,740
No one can hurt you.

195
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,020
You didn't see her face clearly?

196
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,220
The room was quite dark.

197
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,820
She ran away
as soon as Mrs. Mei arrived.

198
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,220
Why do you suddenly want me
to keep an eye on that maid?

199
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,900
I hope this has nothing
to do with Douzi.

200
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,340
Otherwise,

201
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,780
there will be a huge trouble.

202
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,260
Ladies, please wake up.

203
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,300
Her Majesty summons you.

204
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,260
She's already at the Chongwen Academy.

205
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,860
She's already at the Chongwen Academy.

206
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,860
Douzi.

207
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,260
Where is my braised pork leg?

208
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,540
Douzi, wake up.

209
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,060
I'll take beggar's chicken,
lotus duck, and pig's kidney

210
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,020
to go.

211
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,860
The dishes are ready.

212
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,580
Where is the pork leg?

213
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,940
Ladies, please wake up.

214
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,580
Her Majesty summons you.

215
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,740
She's already at the Chongwen Academy.

216
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

217
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,780
The palace opens this academy

218
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,140
to teach and enlighten

219
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,540
everyone of you

220
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,500
to understand what to do

221
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,020
and what not to do.

222
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,420
It's only been a few days
since you've been here.

223
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,500
Yet someone has already caused trouble.

224
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,980
The whole palace is

225
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,340
now gossiping about it.

226
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,900
I thought I got away with it yesterday.

227
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,020
Why does she come
to pick on me again today?

228
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,180
I have to punish you today

229
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,700
to set an example.

230
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,900
Someone coming.

231
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,580
Arrest Mei Yushan...

232
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,420
Mei Yushan's

233
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,500
maid.

234
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,300
Stop! Stop! Let go of her.

235
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,460
What crime did Mei commit?

236
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,420
What crime?

237
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,780
A capital crime.

238
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,820
What happened?

239
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,700
Why are you so happy?

240
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,780
Her Majesty came
to the Guixiu Pavilion today.

241
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,820
I guess she was here
to punish Mei Yushan

242
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,860
for making the Crown Prince
fall into the water.

243
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,660
My Lady, you may not know.

244
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,980
It wasn't Miss Mei
who was saved by His Highness.

245
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,780
It was her maid, Mei.

246
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,860
Mei?

247
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,140
Are you sure?

248
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,500
It seems that a maid is going to draw
all the attention of the Crown Prince

249
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,540
whom you are trying to get close to.

250
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,180
She doesn't deserve it.

251
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,380
My Lady, I feel so sad for you.

252
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,500
But there is one person
who can help you.

253
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,740
Who?

254
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,220
Your Majesty.

255
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,380
May I report

256
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,860
something to you?

257
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,100
It was her that Yao saved?

258
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,940
Yes.

259
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,660
Someone saw it that day.

260
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,380
Right after that maid went over,

261
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,820
they somehow fell into the water.

262
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,740
The person His Highness saved was

263
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,900
that maid.

264
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,540
A maid could actually

265
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,940
make the Crown Prince
risk his life for her.

266
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,940
There is one more thing.

267
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,140
I don't know if I should say it.

268
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,980
Say it.

269
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,420
On the day of our arrival at the palace,

270
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,820
that maid

271
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,060
spent several hours
in the Eastern Palace.

272
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,580
In the end, it was her lady

273
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,260
who took her away personally.

274
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,740
Now I see

275
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,620
why Yao was so afraid
of me finding it out.

276
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,620
Exactly.

277
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,340
Although she is just a maid,

278
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,220
she is quite smart

279
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,460
and knows how to get close to men well.

280
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,780
Maybe

281
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
it is because His Highness
has feelings for her

282
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,420
and worries she might be punished,

283
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,540
he has kept the whole thing a secret.

284
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,740
If she really wins His Highness's heart,

285
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,740
well, her status will be elevated.

286
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,180
She'll completely change her life.

287
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,900
In this Imperial Harem,

288
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,260
there are too many maids
who want to elevate their statuses.

289
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,820
But often,

290
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,420
they end up failing in doing so.

291
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,020
It's really Miss Mei.

292
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,380
What is going on?

293
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,100
It's been found.

294
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,540
Can it be...

295
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,660
Do you know what you're guilty of?

296
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,620
I don't know.

297
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,860
You pulled your lady
to pretend a fall into the water,

298
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,340
trying to seduce the Crown Prince,
didn't you?

299
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,260
I didn't.

300
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,260
That's not the truth at all.

301
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,540
What do mean by pretending?

302
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,620
So annoying.

303
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,140
Someone coming.

304
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,540
Yes.

305
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,380
Take Miss Mei aside.

306
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,420
So noisy.

307
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
Miss Mei.

308
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,460
Don't touch me!

309
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,820
You want to put yourself over the top

310
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,940
and elevate your status.

311
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,940
In your dreams.

312
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,540
I indeed fell into the water.

313
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,780
But I didn't pretend.

314
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,580
I don't know how to swim.

315
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,060
If His Highness hadn't come
to save me that day,

316
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,780
I must have been dead.

317
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,060
If what Your Majesty said was true,

318
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,660
I could have used other safe methods

319
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,780
to seduce His Highness.

320
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,140
I'd have plenty of chances
to try it again and again.

321
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,860
Why would I risk my life
for just one chance

322
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,220
that is not worth the candle?

323
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,700
Mei is so intelligent.

324
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,460
She knows how to argue.

325
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,100
I would have been so angry.

326
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,700
How dare you talk back to me?

327
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,660
Tell me then.

328
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,220
Do you secretly

329
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,740
have a crush on the Crown Prince?

330
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,820
Absolutely no.

331
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,620
Why should I believe whatever you say?

332
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Your Majesty,

333
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,900
I just found this

334
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,940
in her room.

335
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,780
Please have a look.

336
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,620
Why is this in the palace?

337
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,060
I gave it to that woman, didn't I?

338
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,820
If you don't have a crush
on the Crown Prince,

339
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,900
then what is your reason for hiding

340
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,980
[Nangong Yao]
his jade pendant?

341
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,060
Don't worry.

342
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,500
This is all for your safety.

343
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,980
Your Majesty,

344
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,460
I have something important to report.

345
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,620
Go ahead.

346
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,420
Your Majesty,

347
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,620
yesterday Mei caught a cold.

348
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,220
I worried about her,
so I went to visit her.

349
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,420
But I accidentally heard her
whispering in her dream

350
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,980
saying the night His Highness moved
into the Museum,

351
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,900
it was she
who stole the Moon Spirit Pearl.

352
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,820
How does she know the Moon Spirit Pearl?

353
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,500
Do you have any proof?

354
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,940
I found this in Mei's room.

355
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,180
It is...

356
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,180
What is this?

357
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,900
Mr. Bai.

358
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,340
Is that the pearl
you've been looking for?

359
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,580
So it had been

360
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,940
with her the whole time.

361
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,820
Why did she steal the pearl?

362
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,700
Do you still remember

363
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,220
the fishtail-shaped birthmark
I told you?

364
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,660
If it really were her,

365
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,620
that prophecy

366
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,820
would be completely right.

367
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,260
How dare you!

368
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Do you plead guilty?

369
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,820
I absolutely will not plead guilty

370
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,220
to something I didn't do.

371
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,100
That pearl is...

372
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,740
She couldn't have stolen anything.

373
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,380
Miss Mei, please stay out of this.

374
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,620
In this palace,

375
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,660
all the people who can survive
are intelligent somehow.

376
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,780
An evil maid in the Guixiu Pavilion

377
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,380
dared commit two crimes.

378
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,380
Arrest her.

379
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,900
Guard Xingshi,

380
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,220
why are you in such a hurry?

381
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,660
I need to talk to His Highness.
It's urgent.

382
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,140
His Highness left the palace
early in the morning.

383
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,180
He's not back yet?

384
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,700
It was about the fake refugees.

385
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,940
He didn't say when he'd be back.

386
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,420
I've always been merciful.

387
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,900
I never once carried out
extrajudicial punishment in the palace.

388
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,500
But this maid has an evil intention.

389
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,940
If I don't severely punish her,

390
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,700
she will cause more trouble
in the future.

391
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,860
Hit her with paddles fifty times.

392
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,300
Then throw her out of the palace.

393
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,540
Stop it! Stop it!

394
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,180
I won't allow any of you to touch her.

395
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,620
I am the ruler of the Imperial Harem.

396
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,300
Don't I have the power

397
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,220
to punish a maid?

398
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,180
Hit her.

399
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,500
Douzi, move aside.

400
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,340
I won't.

401
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,980
Douzi.

402
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Mr. Bai, don't act impulsively.

403
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,660
I won't.

404
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,460
Get that maniac out of here.

405
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,260
- Hit that maid to death immediately.
- Miss Mei...

406
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,660
- Please move aside.
- Move aside.

407
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,980
They'll pull Miss Mei away.

408
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,940
After being punished so heavily,

409
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,500
she won't survive...

410
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,420
So stubborn.

411
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,940
I won't move aside.

412
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,500
It will remove a hidden danger

413
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,860
- for His Highness.
- Hit them both.

414
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:37,980
Move aside, please.

415
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,820
Go away.

416
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,380
You want to show
that you two are close, right?

417
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,540
Hit them both.

418
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,460
Douzi, move aside.

419
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,900
It hurts.

420
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,380
What to do?

421
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,500
It's...

422
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,140
Stop.

423
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,700
Your Highness.

424
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,980
Why are you so panicked?

425
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,900
Please hurry to the Chongwen Academy.

426
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,740
Miss Mei and her maid were arrested.

427
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,100
What?

428
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,020
Bai Ye respectfully greets Your Majesty.

429
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,860
What are you doing here?

430
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,860
Seeing Miss Mei, a delicate lady,

431
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
being hit like this,

432
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,180
I can't bear it anymore.

433
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,020
So I'm here to beg for your mercy,

434
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Your Majesty.

435
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,260
You're a sinner yourself.

436
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,380
How dare you beg for mercy for others?

437
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,300
Your Majesty,

438
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,700
I know as a sinner,
I'm in no place to beg you.

439
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,420
The only thing I can count on

440
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,420
is this Waning Moon Pendant.

441
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,220
Your Majesty,

442
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,060
the Emperor gave this as a gift
to Bai Ye in his early childhood.

443
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,060
His Majesty once said

444
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,660
this thing could save him
from any disasters.

445
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,420
Trying to intimidate me
with the Emperor.

446
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,660
After the prophecy of Shengdong,

447
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,900
I swore to His Majesty

448
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,940
that I'd break the prophecy
for the Crown Prince.

449
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,900
The Emperor gave this token to me then.

450
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,820
I have taken it with me all these years.

451
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,300
And now,

452
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,060
I hope this Waning Moon Pendant

453
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,740
can protect Miss Mei from any harm.

454
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

455
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,100
Little Diviner,

456
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,780
It's not worth

457
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,940
saving me
with such a valuable token.

458
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,100
Don't worry.

459
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,380
No one can save you today.

460
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,060
Nothing can be accomplished
without rules.

461
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,460
Even if the Emperor himself
is present today,

462
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,820
he can't protect you.

463
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,540
Bai Ye,

464
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,380
this thing is so precious.

465
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,140
I advise you to keep it safe.

466
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,620
What are you waiting for?

467
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,700
Hit them.

468
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,580
Yao is here.

469
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,500
Here comes the Crown Prince.

470
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,540
Hit harder.

471
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,580
Hit harder.

472
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,460
Mother, greetings.

473
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,100
Are you also here to plead for mercy?

474
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,940
I am just here for the show.

475
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,740
Are you punishing them
for what happened yesterday?

476
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,140
Exactly.

477
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,620
Then such light punishment

478
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,900
seems like a mercy already.

479
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,260
What do you mean?

480
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,220
I think they deserve
a heavier punishment.

481
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,300
We can break their hands and legs

482
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
- or...
- Nangong Yao,

483
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,500
what are you trying to do?

484
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,620
Noisy.

485
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,300
Shut her mouth.

486
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,300
Yes.

487
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,020
Stop talking.

488
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,580
Stop talking. His Highness has a plan.

489
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,140
Speaking of yesterday,

490
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,380
I just happened to be in the mood,

491
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,580
so I deliberately
pushed Miss Mei into the lake.

492
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,660
Her stupid maid

493
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,500
tried to protect her and ended up
falling into the lake as well.

494
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,940
But who knows after they got out,

495
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,020
Miss Mei showed me no respect at all.

496
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
I got angry,

497
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,940
so I scolded her in public.

498
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,860
I am the Crown Prince.

499
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,180
I believe I can push anyone
into the river as I want, right?

500
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,860
Thus, I think you punishing them for me

501
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,260
is reasonable.

502
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,060
Do you know what you're saying?

503
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,260
Answer me this then,

504
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,620
about this jade pendant,
how do you explain?

505
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,060
I asked her
to take the jade pendant with her.

506
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,380
So they could kneel to it

507
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,540
and make up for their mistakes.

508
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,620
You're protecting them.

509
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,100
You should know

510
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,820
that I have concrete proof

511
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,180
of Mei Yushan's maid
stealing the Moon Spirit Pearl.

512
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,140
Even if your father is here,

513
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,620
he can't protect her.

514
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
Your Highness, here.

515
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,820
This pearl was found in their room

516
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,660
at the Guixiu Pavilion.

517
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,220
This pearl

518
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,060
was originally placed in the eye
of the Domestic Cat Monster.

519
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,140
Mother, you didn't know.

520
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,660
The Domestic Cat Monsters
was very strange.

521
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,500
Its left eye was a pearl.

522
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,180
Its right eye was a bodhi fruit.

523
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,380
It was very uncomfortable for me
to see them asymmetric.

524
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,380
So I just removed it.

525
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,380
Your Highness,

526
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,180
we found this pearl in their room...

527
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,980
I gave it to her.

528
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,340
But...

529
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,980
What?

530
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,260
Must I have your permission

531
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,340
before I give anyone anything?

532
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,380
I wouldn't dare say that.

533
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,180
This pearl isn't worth anything anyway.

534
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,660
Since they liked it,

535
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,860
I just gave it to them.

536
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,660
Mother, if you are interested
in such pearls,

537
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,180
I will find some more

538
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,220
and deliver them to you.

539
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,860
Enough.

540
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,940
You may leave now.

541
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,340
But I'm still interested in the show.

542
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,540
Go on.

543
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Continue.

544
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,060
Now this is hard to deal with.
We should think it through.

545
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,740
Leave off.

546
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,780
I'm afraid

547
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,100
what happened yesterday
was a misunderstanding.

548
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,820
I will find out the truth

549
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,260
before I make a final decision.

550
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,860
Mother,

551
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,180
do we just let them go?

552
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,260
Disrespecting me
is to despise the royal family.

553
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,460
We should punish them and their families
in the heaviest way possible.

554
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,340
Nonsense.

555
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,980
Grand Chancellor Mei
is an important minister in the court.

556
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,940
He's your father's right-hand man.

557
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,420
Then...

558
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,940
Why don't we punish Miss Mei
to come to the eastern palace

559
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,180
to work as a maid for a few months?

560
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,620
I will punish her heavily.

561
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,140
You...

562
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,620
Mei Yushan
contradicted me in public today.

563
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,180
Her punishment will be
to stay in the Chongwen Academy

564
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,460
and copy the palace rules fifty times.

565
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,420
Her maid failed to protect her lady.

566
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,940
So she'll be punished together.

567
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,580
You have to kneel
until the copying is finished.

568
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,540
Set off.

569
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,060
Take care, Your Majesty.

570
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,220
Luckily, Yao came in time.

571
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,660
Only you can protect her after all.

572
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,420
Say no more.

573
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,980
Keep your mouth shut about it.

574
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,380
I told you

575
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,380
I'm in charge of all her affairs.

576
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,180
Even if it's not true,

577
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,100
the Crown Prince really likes her.

578
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,540
I'll go get the physicians.

579
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,340
His Highness doesn't seem too happy.

580
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,380
Yeah.

581
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,060
Mr. Bai.

582
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,100
We saved the right one

583
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,940
but also saved
the one we shouldn't save.

584
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,060
Que.

585
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,540
- Were you trying to get her killed?
- Yes.

586
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,100
You stopped me like this.

587
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,060
Aren't you afraid people might see us?

588
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,180
Why did you dare to do so?

589
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,820
Last night...

590
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,140
I saw her throw herself at you.

591
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,500
It's not like what you think.

592
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,820
From now on,

593
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,100
without my orders,

594
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,020
don't take any action.

595
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,740
If you disobey me again,

596
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,300
I will send you away at once

597
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,580
and never meet you again.

598
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,660
Sir, because of a box,

599
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,060
you just recognize her as the princess?

600
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,580
Whether she's the princess or not,

601
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,540
she is very important to me.

602
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,780
I ran out of one bottle of ink,

603
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,300
yet I still haven't finished it.

604
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,260
You didn't steal that pearl.

605
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,940
Why did that maid

606
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,820
suddenly set you up for no reason?

607
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,060
Is it because of me?

608
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,700
Is it because Su Ruomei saw

609
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,820
Little Master and I get close,

610
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,820
she asked her maid to do such things?

611
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,740
That doesn't make any sense.

612
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
How did they know about the pearl?

613
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,740
Also, how did that jade pendant
show up again?

614
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,980
I'm here on behalf of my mother.

615
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,100
Douzi, wake up.

616
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,420
The Empress is here.

617
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,460
Douzi.

618
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,260
Douzi?

619
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,500
Why does she send a man here?

620
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,060
Is she going to punish me again?

621
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,700
Here.

622
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,140
I brought you two cushions.

623
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,740
Go and rest over there.

624
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,860
Okay.

625
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,060
Here.

626
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,020
Eat something.

627
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
Get the chopsticks.

628
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,300
Yes.

629
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,820
Eat something.

630
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,500
I'll take my leave.

631
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,820
I don't want anything.

632
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,370
♪It's your mesmerizing glance♪

633
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,830

638
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,180
Shen Yu, Mr. Shen.

639
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,380
You're...

640
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,420
No need to panic, Sir.

641
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,780
I'm just here to deliver a message.

642
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Then I'll leave.

643
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,420
Go on.

644
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,260
The crime that the thieves
claimed pensions

645
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,260
could be a felony or nothing.

646
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,020
My master asked me to deliver a message.

647
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,060
He wants this case to end soon.

648
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,100
And your master is...

649
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,700
Liu Qinyuan. Mr. Liu.

650
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,060
The Crown Prince will hear the case
again at Wu hour tomorrow.

651
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,460
Whether it's going
to be a felony or not

652
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,060
is up to the Crown Prince.

653
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,260
You have solid evidence

654
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,820
of those thieves.

655
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,540
His Highness is in charge of the hiring.

656
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,060
Do you think His Highness

657
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,580
will discredit himself
by making the decision?

658
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,660
This thing

659
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,500
happened in your precinct, Mr. Shen.

660
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,580
If one day

661
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,420
anyone makes an issue of this...

662
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,100
Uhh...

663
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,220
I wonder what Mr. Liu wants...

664
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,380
Force them to plead guilty.

665
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,660
Advance the execution.

666
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,100
It's...

667
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,380
Advance to when?

668
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Chen hour.

669
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,340
If you do this right

670
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,980
and help Mr. Liu,

671
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,100
there will be rewards in the future.

672
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,380
But if you fail,

673
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,460
I'm afraid your career
is coming to an end.

674
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
I need to see Mr. Liu.

675
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,940
Master, Shen Yu agreed.

676
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,100
[Liu Qinyuan]
And the refugees and the sorceress?

677
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,140
Everything has been arranged
according to your orders.

678
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,860
The Crown Prince
hired thieves by mistake.

679
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,900
If they advance the execution
to cover up for it,

680
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,260
the news will be spread
out tomorrow morning.

681
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,860
We have the sorceress's daughter.

682
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,860
She dared not disobey us.

683
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,060
Good.

684
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,300
The execution tomorrow

685
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,020
will attract many refugees to watch.

686
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,700
This is a big trouble.

687
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,300
We might as well make it even bigger.

688
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,420
Ask our men to mingle with the refugees

689
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,220
and point out that the disaster
is a sign of our country's destruction.

690
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,340
Then identify the Crown Prince
as the cause.

691
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,820
Those refugees lost
their parents, wives and children.

692
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,660
Just a little incitement

693
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,060
will make them do stupid things.

694
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,540
Very wise, Master.

695
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,140
By then,

696
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
even if the Crown Prince
gets away with it,

697
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,700
the rumor of the country's destruction
will make the people of Jixi

698
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
restless and worried.

699
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,020
We can then make a big deal out of it

700
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,420
and force him to abdicate.

701
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,740
By the way,

702
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,660
be very careful tomorrow.

703
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,900
There can be no mistakes.

704
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,900
Yes.

705
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,260
Master,

706
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,340
what else

707
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,980
should we plan ahead in the court?

708
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,300
Don't act rashly.

709
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,020
Liu Family has been serving the country
for three generations.

710
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,140
We have a solid foundation.

711
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,060
The Empress thinks she can take me down
with a few memorials.

712
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,180
That is naive.

713
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,460
Master,

714
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,060
I wonder

715
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,940
if I can say something.

716
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,740
Say it.

717
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,540
The Crown Prince is
in His Majesty's favor.

718
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,880
The prophecy
of the country's destruction

719
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,900
has been there for a long time.

720
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,140
But His Majesty has never thought
about abolishing him

721
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,740
and choosing someone else
as the Crown Prince.

722
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,540
Besides, after the Crown Prince
came into power,

723
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,300
he's got a lot of ministers
under his command

724
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,100
and built a foundation.

725
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Why don't you pretend to submit to him,

726
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,580
instead of working
with several ministers

727
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,660
against him secretly?

728
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,220
What do you know?

729
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,140
The Crown Prince is
intelligent and upright,

730
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,820
which can make an ordinary person

731
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,740
worth working with.

732
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,860
But if someone like him
becomes the Emperor,

733
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,060
he will not hesitate
to eliminate anything

734
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,820
or anyone wrong.

735
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,180
What will happen
to the ministers like me?

736
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,740
People are all greedy.

737
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,580
How many of us will be able

738
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,420
to keep our status?

739
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,460
Now it's hard to tell who will win.

740
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,820
Even if it's a gamble,

741
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,220
we have to take our chances

742
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,140
and try to destroy him.

743
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,140
That is very wise, Master.

744
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,820
Rest assured.

745
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,740
I will do my best to assist you

746
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,860
and bring us success.

747
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,740
Are you hungry?

748
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,900
Well...I'm not eating.

749
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,460
Let me help her.

750
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,580
Go lie down over there.

751
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,820
Hold on.

752
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,100
Isn't this the secret code
between my fathers and me?

753
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,740
Little Master,

754
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,020
did you see someone
outside the palace today?

755
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,860
I did leave the palace today.

756
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
I also interrogated

757
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,260
three thieves arrested two weeks ago.

758
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,660
Three thieves?

759
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,260
Why were they arrested?

760
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,540
They pretended to be refugees
to claim pensions

761
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,460
and stole money from those refugees.

762
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
At Wu hour tomorrow,

763
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,140
I will have them decapitated.

764
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,900
Decapitate?
