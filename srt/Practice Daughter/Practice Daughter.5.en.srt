00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,580
Lady, you are so funny.

187
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,140
Show me quickly.

188
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,660
Take a look.

189
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,780
Look.

190
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,900
Look how my palm looks.

191
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,420
If he can't tell something good,

192
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,220
I can go back and scare that girl.

193
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,300
See something?

194
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,300
You are a girl with great ideas.

195
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,420
Discursive nature.

196
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,300
Hate to follow the rules.

197
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,100
Your life is not smooth.

198
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,340
And you seem to have encountered

199
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,020
some troubles.

200
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,340
Can he do the divination or not?

201
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,100
Obviously it is Mei Daidai's hand.

202
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,780
Why does it sound like it's me?

203
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,860
Stop, I don't want to continue.

204
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,900
Well.

205
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,260
Why don't you take me out for a walk?

206
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,740
Okay.

207
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,980
What hobbies do you have?

208
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,260
I'm interested in everything.

209
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,260
Come on.

210
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,260
Come with me.

211
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,820
[Xingqing Hall]

212
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,180
Your Highness.

213
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,980
Just now Mr. Xing sent a dozen excerpts.

214
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,580
I put them all in your study.

215
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,420
I haven't gone in court for a day or two

216
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,740
and many pieces have accumulated.

217
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,020
Bring me my seal.

218
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,660
Yes.

219
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,380
Your Highness, where's Xing?

220
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,100
He went to Guixiu Pavilion with you.

221
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,060
He hasn't come back yet?

222
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,420
He said he had something to do.

223
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,380
And he resigned from the palace.

224
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,300
The gang at the Imperial Restaurant
are in good spirits today.

225
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,900
They gathered some cherry petals
to make pastries.

226
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,540
I can only eat once a year.

227
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,660
Really rare.

228
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,100
It's not enough
for everyone in the Palace.

229
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,780
Your Highness should have a taste first.

230
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,500
[Zuo]

231
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,180
[Zuo]
Your Highness.

232
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,500
You are?

233
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,100
I am the servant
of the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

234
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,700
I enter the palace
to learn with Miss Mei.

235
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,860
Zuo.

236
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,620
You go out first.

237
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,820
I have something to ask her.

238
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,460
Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,100
It's Your Highness's habit.

240
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,180
These two cups of tea

241
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,620
should be symmetrical all the time.

242
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,380
I.

243
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,350
[Tianji Mansion]

244
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,860
Watch the steps.

245
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,100
Beautiful, Little Diviner.

246
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,300
My first time here.

247
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,940
I have the same reaction as you do.

248
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,980
You can actually call me Little Bean.

249
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,460
You call me Miss Mei,

250
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,820
it always feels weird.

251
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,020
Really?

252
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,660
I'm lucky enough to call your nickname?

253
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,700
Of course.

254
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,980
Call me Little Bean in the future.

255
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,620
Do you hear me?

256
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,220
Little Bean.

257
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,860
Little Bean.

258
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,140
That sounds so kind.

259
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,100
It's like a new friend.

260
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,260
Wherever, whenever we meet,

261
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,740
we're all brothers and sisters.

262
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,500
This is for you.

263
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,260
What?

264
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,700
Take it and look up.

265
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,300
Look west.

266
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,540
West.

267
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,340
Did you find it?

268
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,900
There are seven bright stars.

269
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,220
The so-called stars crossed
and Big Dipper Rotated.

270
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,340
These seven

271
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,380
are called the Big Dipper.

272
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,980
You see.

273
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,700
See it?

274
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,580
Really.

275
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,420
Like a hook.

276
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,580
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

277
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,460
Exactly seven.

278
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,620
These seven stars

279
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,020
go up a little bit,

280
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,020
that means summer is coming.

281
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,540
Bucket handle points east,

282
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,380
spring comes.

283
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,180
You can follow the direction
of the bucket handle

284
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,300
take a look east.

285
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,900
East.

286
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,980
East, see that way?

287
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,260
Yes.

288
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,060
There are two very bright stars
over there.

289
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,300
They're called Dual Horn Guard East.

290
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,260
This one is called Arcturus.

291
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,620
The one next to it

292
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,180
is called Spica.

293
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,300
So beautiful.

294
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,380
Little Bean.

295
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,620
You think the stars in the sky

296
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,500
look like what?

297
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,940
Like

298
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,660
a brown sugar cake
sprinkled with sesame seeds.

299
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,860
I feel like

300
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,180
many fireflies

301
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,060
in a blue quilt.

302
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,940
Look at that one.

303
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Flying Star.

304
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,940
It's really fast.

305
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,380
Look at that.

306
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,100
Look at that.

307
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,220
That's nice.

308
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,780
This is Wenzhou Yanming Tea?

309
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,460
Delicate fragrance and sweetness.

310
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,660
Such a taste and appearance.

311
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,340
You can't drink it
in the Grand Chancellor's Mansion.

312
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,700
The highest state of tea drinking

313
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,580
should be like Lu Tong's poem.

314
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,100
First bowl, it moistens your throat.

315
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,980
Second bowl, it breaks loneliness.

316
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,220
Third bowl, it stimulates inspiration.

317
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,180
Fourth bowl, sweat sweeps out.

318
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,180
Fifth bowl, you'll feel a new vitality.

319
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,260
Sixth bowl, you'll be like in the air.

320
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,580
Seventh bowl,
you'll feel like you're an immortal.

321
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,300
Why do you speak
so similarly to Mei Yushan?

322
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
Your Highness, please forgive me.

323
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,540
The other night at the museum,

324
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,820
she also spoke in a gentle way.

325
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,500
After entering the palace,

326
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,620
It's like a different person.

327
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,300
Zuo.

328
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,900
I'm here.

329
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,980
Bring that box over there.

330
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,700
Yes.

331
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,580
Go.

332
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,660
Yes.

333
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,380
Little Diviner.

334
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,140
You've been looking at the stars
for so many years.

335
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,700
Are you feeling stale already?

336
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,500
No.

337
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,020
The star patterns
are different every night.

338
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,100
It never repeats.

339
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,060
Really?

340
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,380
Can I come here in the future?

341
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,180
Of course.

342
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,140
Very welcome.

343
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,620
That's great.

344
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,220
Your place is really interesting.

345
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Snake.

346
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,940
Don't be rude.

347
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,740
You, you talk to it?

348
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,020
It can understand?

349
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,020
I.

350
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,980
Don't come here.

351
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,020
If you get any closer,

352
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
I'll chop you head,

353
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
remove your guts,

354
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,420
cut your head,

355
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,340
tail,

356
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,460
cut you into pieces.

357
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,020
I'll bake you, stew you,

358
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,220
braise you.

359
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
It's alright.

360
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,180
Your Highness.

361
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,660
Don't come any closer.

362
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,460
Xiaobai, it's alright.

363
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,420
You scared it.

364
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,540
Xiaobai is the snake's name?

365
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,260
It has a name?

366
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,500
Here.

367
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,500
I have raised the pet for many years.

368
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,900
It's been by my side for years.

369
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,100
Little Bean, please be kind.

370
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,580
Don't roast,

371
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,180
stew

372
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,340
and braise my Xiaobai.

373
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,620
Please.

374
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,700
[Tianji Mansion]

375
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,300
Please.

376
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,700
Little Diviner.

377
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,100
That painting just now.

378
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,940
It's not a painting.

379
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,020
It's just a record of my meditation.

380
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,100
If it's broken, it's broken.

381
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,020
Don't worry about it.

382
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,460
But,

383
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,340
is what's on the painting your thing?

384
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,620
No.

385
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,660
So many years,

386
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,420
I've been sending people looking for it,

387
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,420
but haven't found the whereabouts yet.

388
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,220
He is also looking for this pearl.

389
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,340
The pearl.

390
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Is it valuable?

391
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,020
Why are you looking for it?

392
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,260
This pearl

393
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,500
is the lead of evil.

394
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a disaster.

395
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,980
It should not remain in the world.

396
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,340
If it's found,

397
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,820
it must be destroyed immediately.

398
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,380
You.

399
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,380
You're not looking for more than pearls,

400
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,060
but also to destroy the pearls.

401
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,060
What about me and Daidai?

402
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,340
Do you recognize

403
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,740
this pearl?

404
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,420
It looks like Miss Mei's pearl.

405
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,900
It's exactly your lady's pearl.

406
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,260
Is there anything special

407
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,180
about it?

408
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,260
Why does your lady take it so seriously?

409
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,940
Tell me the truth.

410
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,620
No concealment is allowed.

411
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,700
Did Miss Mei give you this pearl?

412
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,380
You just have to answer the questions.

413
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,620
This pearl looks ordinary,

414
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,540
but it's my lady's favorite thing
since she was a child.

415
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,820
She told me

416
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,340
she will give it to her future husband.

417
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,220
I'll bet you twenty.

418
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,300
Today.

419
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,700
Another girl's heart is about to break.

420
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,700
I'm not betting with you.

421
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,140
If this pearl

422
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,740
was a gift from Miss Mei to you.

423
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,220
It's probably
a girl's unspeakable secrct.

424
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,100
I hope Your Highness will cherish it.

425
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,100
I told you you were interested in me.

426
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,380
Don't try to deny it.

427
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,380
Since

428
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,940
it's her gift to her future husband.

429
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,980
There is no reason for me to occupy it.

430
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,180
Give it back to her.

431
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,580
Well.

432
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,540
If you insist on returning the pearl,

433
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,540
Miss Mei might feel lost in her heart.

434
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,580
I'll go back to Guixiu Pavilion

435
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,220
to be there with her.

436
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,660
All right.

437
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,500
This cherry blossom cake.

438
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,540
Is it something Miss Mei likes?

439
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,620
You can bring her some.

440
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,220
It just occurred to me

441
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,500
that Miss Mei enters the palace today,

442
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,740
ate and took.

443
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,260
When painting the palace statue,

444
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,220
the food spilled all over the floor.

445
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,780
I just thought

446
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,260
it's just ordinary pastries.

447
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,100
Since she likes it so much,

448
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,980
just bring her some.

449
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,700
Little Diviner.

450
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,980
What's so flustered.

451
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,620
Bad.

452
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,340
My maid left a letter saying

453
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,460
she's taken to the East Palace
by the Prince.

454
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
How could the maid
be taken to the East Palace?

455
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,420
Yeah.

456
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,820
They don't have a problem.

457
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,220
It must be about school.

458
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,500
He came to trouble me.

459
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,700
I have to hurry to the East Palace.

460
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,980
I'll be responsible for what I've done.

461
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,140
I can't let Mei Daidai
take the fall for me.

462
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,340
Little Diviner, I'm leaving.

463
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,100
Little Bean.

464
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,300
Let me in.

465
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,060
How many times have I told you.

466
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,540
The East Palace is under martial law.

467
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,580
Just let me go in and find someone.

468
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,420
No.

469
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,540
Please report.

470
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,820
Mei Yushan,
daughter of Grand Chancellor Mei.

471
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,140
Together with Bai Ye
to see Your Highness.

472
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,460
Take swords back.

473
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,820
It turned out to be Mr. Bai.

474
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,220
His Highness the Prince has an order.

475
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,140
Mr. Bai enters and leaves
the East Palace at any time

476
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,180
and can't be stopped.

477
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,140
Please.

478
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,860
Zuo.

479
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,620
I'm here.

480
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,860
Send Miss Mei back first.

481
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,540
Yes.

482
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
Miss Mei, please.

483
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,220
Mei Daidai.

484
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,180
Daidai, are you all right?

485
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,100
Is it all right?

486
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,980
What's wrong?

487
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,780
Miss Mei breaks
into the East Palace at night

488
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,900
to condemn me?

489
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,940
How dare I condemn you?

490
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,460
I'm here to find my servant.

491
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,700
It's black outside.

492
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,900
But she hasn't come back yet.

493
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Thank you, Miss.

494
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,220
Be cautious in words and deeds.

495
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,380
I understand.

496
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,660
I took your maid an hour ago.

497
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,180
You weren't in a hurry before.

498
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,660
What's the rush now?

499
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,660
I.

500
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,700
I'm not in a hurry right now.

501
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,620
Your Highness, if you want to keep her,

502
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,020
there are exactly four of us.

503
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,060
Enough to play mahjong.

504
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,300
I'm kidding.

505
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,860
Your Highness.

506
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,140
Miss Mei is kidding.

507
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,380
The maid in the room is not around

508
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
may bring many inconveniences.

509
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,540
So, she came here to search.

510
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,940
I was in the neighborhood by accident,

511
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,940
so I brought her in.

512
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,180
At this hour,

513
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,580
only you have free access
to the East Palace.

514
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,020
These two people
seem to have an unusual relationship.

515
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,900
Then we have to get the pearls faster.

516
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,780
If Little Diviner got it first,

517
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,140
I'm done with Daidai.

518
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,940
Return a thing intact to its owner.

519
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,940
You have your servant girl.

520
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,220
But,

521
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,540
I also gave one thing back to you.

522
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,860
Is he going to return
the Moon Spirit pearl to me?

523
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,940
It really didn't take much effort.

524
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,300
Since it is a beloved thing,

525
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,300
keep it properly in the future.

526
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,740
Don't let it fall on others ever again.

527
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,660
What kind of beloved thing is this?

528
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,900
I hate it.

529
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,020
I can't wait to hit it eighty times,

530
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,940
kicked it a hundred feet.

531
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,300
It's killing me.

532
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,460
Why do you pinch me?

533
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,340
Then.

534
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

535
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,180
Go. Let's go.

536
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,220
Go.

537
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
Won't you open it and have a check?

538
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,100
No.

539
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,380
In the box,

540
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,620
is it yours or not?

541
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
You don't worry about making a mistake?

542
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,740
It's my stuff.

543
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,660
It can't be mistaken.

544
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,540
Go.

545
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,140
Stay put.

546
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,860
Miss Mei.

547
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,340
I know it's your stuff.

548
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,860
His Royal Highness just wanted to open

549
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
to confirm.

550
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,220
Then follow his order

551
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
to pen it and take a look.

552
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,180
No.

553
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,900
Well, there's must be a reason.

554
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,020
I.

555
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,980
Since Miss Mei insisted on not opening,

556
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,100
then there's no way to confirm

557
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,220
whether it's yours or not.

558
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,300
Don't blame me

559
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,060
can't give it back to you for now.

560
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,420
Dong Xi.

561
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,740
Yes.

562
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,620
No.

563
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,180
Just open a box.

564
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,020
Bring it to me.

565
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,140
Where's the pearl?

566
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,340
I saw something just now.

567
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,380
Fine, Mei Yushan.

568
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,420
The bamboo slices
have surprised me enough.

569
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,460
You play this drama
for me in the evening.

570
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
It's...

571
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,420
It is an empty box.

572
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
You're cheating.

573
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,780
I'm cheating?

574
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,540
If you don't believe me, search.

575
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,380
Search.

576
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,980
You.

577
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,340
Now that you have your thing,

578
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,860
it's useless to keep an empty box.

579
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,620
I'm sorry.

580
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,780
It's so slippery.

581
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,460
I'll get you this.

582
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,260
I'll get it for you.
I'll get it for you.

583
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,180
Slippery?

584
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
You're the only one says it's slippery.

585
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,620
It's slippery even in East Palace?

586
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
This time it's true.

587
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,780
Does Grand Chancellor have no money

588
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,740
to make you a pair of shoes?

589
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,950
I'll have
the Imperial Household Department

590
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,380
make you another pair tomorrow.

591
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,340
Don't bother.

592
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,100
It's not slippery when I see others.

593
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,700
My feet are slippery when I see you.

594
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,860
Your clothes look precious.

595
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,260
- You should blame it on me?
- Why is its quality so bad?

596
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
This can't be deducted.

597
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,580
What are you waiting for?

598
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,620
Go.

599
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,740
Bai Ye, did you just see it?

600
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,940
She did it on purpose, didn't she?

601
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,980
[Xingqing Hall]
His Highness.

602
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,780
I do think

603
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,820
your charm today

604
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,020
was seen by all.

605
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,220
I helped you and you still laugh.

606
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
That's too much, you guys.

607
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,500
I think today's event is worth mounting,

608
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,580
hanging above the East Palace

609
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,620
as a memorial.

610
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,540
Commemorative, huh?

611
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,940
You can be a  memento, too.

612
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,820
No.

613
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,770
[East Palace]

614
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,940
Your Highness.

615
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,060
That day I saw Miss Mei,

616
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,660
she spoke and behaved rather strangely.

617
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,140
Thinking that you must have doubts,

618
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,060
so I take the lead without authorization

619
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,580
to hide the pearl.

620
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,900
Please forgive me.

621
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,940
It's no big deal.

622
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,500
You're doing a great job.

623
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,620
The two girls speak the wrong way.

624
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,140
There must be something wrong
with this pearl.

625
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,300
Check out this pearl.

626
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,940
Yes.

627
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,340
Mr. Bai.

628
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,580
Do I need to clean up here?

629
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,780
No.

630
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,220
You go first.

631
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,820
Yes.

632
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,780
If you don't come,

633
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,980
I've got the Moon Spirit Pearl.

634
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,220
You blame me?

635
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,540
Why don't you blame His Highness
for being treacherous?

636
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,860
He fools us with an empty box.

637
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,180
You're still standing there like a log,

638
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
saying nothing.

639
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,580
You talked too much.

640
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,300
What's wrong with me when I talk?

641
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,940
You say it.

642
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,540
You.

643
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,100
It was agreed
that I would sleep in the bed.

644
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,220
I thought you changed your mind.

645
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,260
I thought we said we slept together.

646
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,220
Sneaky.

647
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,820
Commander.

648
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,700
She looks like the little maid who
molested a little eunuch during the day.

649
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,140
Palace maid.

650
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,500
Which palace maid are you?

651
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,300
Report your name.

652
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Commander Fei.

653
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,700
That female thief
and the Empress of Shengdong

654
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,860
looks exactly the same.

655
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,660
Very similar.

656
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,580
It was too dark at the Museum that day.

657
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,140
And it's far.

658
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,540
I didn't see her face, either.

659
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,940
I accidentally met her
in Guixiu Pavilion

660
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,540
the look of her eyebrows and eyes

661
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,500
is exactly the same as Empress Li.

662
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,740
You must keep an eye
on her whereabouts.

663
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,180
She could have been taken away

664
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,020
by the darts.

665
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,740
Princess Yueying.

666
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,940
Why did she enter the palace pretending
to be the maid of the Mei Mansion?

667
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,580
Can't it be

668
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,620
because of the prophecy, so she
wanted to get close to the prince?

669
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,780
I've thought about it, too.

670
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,220
But I don't think it's possible.

671
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,940
If she were a princess.

672
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,020
She must know it.

673
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,700
After all, the princess
was only 6 months

674
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,620
when the princess was taken away.

675
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,900
When you met her the other day,

676
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,780
did she see your face clearly?

677
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,940
I've been masked.

678
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,140
You will follow me into the palace
as soon as possible.

679
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,220
Pay close attention to her movements.

680
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,660
You're finally willing
to take me into the palace.

681
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,420
Zhongwu General Su Shenhai

682
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,940
has joined my command.

683
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,740
You can pretend to be
a servant girl of the Su's.

684
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,700
But after entering the palace,

685
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,940
don't contact me
without something important.

686
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Avoid being suspected.

687
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,660
Su Ruomei doesn't know who you are.

688
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,140
You have to be more careful.

689
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,180
Commander Fei, show mercy.

690
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,020
This is my servant girl, Que.

691
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,620
She just entered the palace tonight.

692
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,700
She's stupid.

693
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,300
Disturb Commander Fei.

694
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,140
Have you ever seen them?

695
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,740
Suspicious.

696
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,180
Catch them.

697
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,780
I have the wrong people.

698
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,180
Excuse me.

699
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,980
Excuse me.

700
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,860
Go.

701
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,300
I don't care what way you use

702
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,220
to lure my father into
trusting you into the palace.

703
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,380
You have to listen to me
when you are around me.

704
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,380
If such thing happens in the future,

705
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,380
I won't spare you anymore.

706
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,060
Blamed me for
not being able to get the pearl.

707
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,060
You're like a pig to me.

708
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,620
Then I'll draw you a pig.

709
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,180
When I was little, Third Father said

710
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,380
the birthmark
on my shoulder looks weird.

711
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,220
It looks like

712
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,700
kind of similar to the pattern

713
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,860
of the moon pearl.

714
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,620
[Jixi Kingdom]

715
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,400
[Recruitment]

716
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,340
I inquired

717
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,860
that the pearl is a flying star fragment
that fell many years ago.

718
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,500
Named Moon Spirit pearl.

719
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,340
It is the treasure of Sheng Dong.

720
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,820
It is said that
when Empress Shengdong had dystocia.

721
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,340
She got this pearl to help

722
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
and gave birth to a princess.

723
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,540
After Shengdong was destroyed by Jixi,

724
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,380
the pearl went missing.

725
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,020
Why is the thing of Shengdong

726
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,580
in the hands of Mei Yushan?

727
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,780
I will continue to investigate.

728
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,780
I heard

729
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,540
that Mr. Bai
is also looking for this pearl.

730
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,420
Mr. Bai
has always ignored common affairs.

731
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,380
Why does he want this pearl?

732
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,660
In contrast, Mei Yushan

733
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,260
shows great interest in this pearl.

734
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,180
Her servant girl is also very strange.

735
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,460
There must be a reason.

736
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,700
Yes, Your Highness.

737
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,940
One more thing.

738
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,140
Count the number of people
in the Zhongji Court that day.

739
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,660
Found one absconding.

740
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,660
[Recruitment]
The Court of Judicature
and Revision has sent people to check.

741

in Zhongji Court has only increased.

742
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,780
Sooner or later overwhelmed.

will be ordered to go down today.
