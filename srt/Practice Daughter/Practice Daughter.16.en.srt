72
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,300

73
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,420
which violates the palace rules.

74

I beg Your Highness to punish them.

75
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,180
They'd better be flogged eighty times.

76
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,780

to handle affairs.

Medicine.

102
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,180
This is just water.

103
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,780

to put the herbs in.

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,420
And she wouldn't allow me
to do anything.

Here I come.

109
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,300
I can stew the chicken now.

110
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,380

111
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,700
Stewing the chicken with herbs.

112
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,860
It is still alive.

113
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,420
You need to kill it and get it plucked.

114
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Do I still need to get it plucked?
How do I do that?

115

116
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,060
Get me a towel.

117
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,100
I'll help Douzi wash up.

118
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Let me do it for her.

119
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,300
It is improper for men and women
to touch each other.

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,700
Nanbei.

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,260
- Thank you, Your Highness... - Yes.

124
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
- But if Douzi...
- Ask Eunuch Song...

125
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,540
- goes with you...
- to clean this place up.

126
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,340
to the Eastern Palace,
she'll be criticized again.

127
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,100
I remember, in The Book of Songs,

128
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,980
it is said that one must always
restrain oneself even when in love.

129
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,420
It is human nature
to fall in love with others.

130
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,250
But restraining oneself
is the indoctrination

131
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,020
of the deceased emperors in former times

132
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,140
Moreover, Confucius and Mencius
also advocated

133
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,100
that it is improper for men and women
to touch each other.

134
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Even if you are in love,

135
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,220
you can't go against the old maxim.

136
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,060
Your Highness.

137
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,620
Your Highness?

138
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,300
Now the Emperor is ill.

139
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,540
And something tricky
happened to the Crown Prince.

140
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,220
I'm so exhausted.

141
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,140
That Shen Yu
is a courtier and an official,

142
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,180
yet he failed
to protect the Crown Prince.

143
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,860
I think that's the end of his career.

144
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,740
Your Majesty.

145
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,340
Don't be mad.

146
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,060
Have some ginseng soup.

147
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,100
You've served me for years,
how can't you tell the difference

148
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,940
between the wild ginseng
and the western ginseng?

149
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

150
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,820
This morning I went
to the Imperial Household Department.

151
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,420
But the head of the department said,

152
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,500
the Eastern Palace took away
all the supplements.

153
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,980
Especially wild ginseng.

154
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,780
Not a single one left.

155
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,860
It's okay if they were all eaten
by the Crown Prince.

156
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,860
It's good.

157
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,740
Ever since the Grand Tutor said
Miss Mei was weak,

158
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,100
His Highness has asked our kitchen
to brew medicine every day.

159
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,340
Miss Mei has already had

160
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,220
- six plants of wild ginseng.
- The wild ginseng is here.

161
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,580
Go get the Lingzhi.

162
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Let's go, You.

163
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,100
Let me see.

164
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,300
I don't want to see wild ginseng again.

165
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,020
But His Highness commanded me

166
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
to make sure you drink it.

167
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,060
I'll die if I drink more of it.

168
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,940
If you want to build up my health,

169
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,660
get me something I like instead.

170
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,380
What do you like then?

171
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,460
Put the pot lid on.

172
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,260
Miss Mei says

173
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,940
the key to cooking pig's
large intestines is the smell.

174
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,580
Put it on.

175
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,700
If I put the lid on,
the vibe will be ruined.

176
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,540
It's not even clean.

177
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,340
Miss Mei also wants stinky tofu.

178
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,180
The particularly smelly and spicy one.

179
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,500
I'll ask the Crown Prince.

180
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,780
You keep an eye on it for me.

181
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,260
I'll be right back.

182
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Zuo.

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,020
Your Highness,

184
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,540
the magistrate of Hu County
requests funds to repair their bridge...

185
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,020
Funds have been allocated every year.

186
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,220
It's been three years, yet the bridge
still hasn't been repaired.

187
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,260
Does he take me as a fool?

188
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,500
His request is refused.

189
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,780
Dongxi.

190
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,140
Dongxi, please report to His Highness

191
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,740
that Miss Mei wants to fry stinky tofu

192
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,820
in her room.

193
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,940
She is waiting.

194
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,900
Hurry up.

195
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,020
Your Highness,

196
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,060
Miss Mei wants to fry stinky tofu.

197
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,300
Allow her to do so.

198
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,780
Yes.

199
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,140
Your Highness,

200
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,260
the Imperial College proposes
that rural students

201
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,660
should be forbidden to participate
in the Imperial Examinations.

202
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,380
They worry if they all become officials,

203
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,620
there will be no one to do farm work.

204
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,500
Absurd!

205
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,340
Their requests are refused.

206
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,820
Your Highness,

207
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,460
Miss Mei wants to make mutton soup
in the Eastern Palace.

208
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,380
Allow her to do so.

209
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,020
Yes.

210
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,260
Your Highness,

211
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,300
Yong Prefecture's magistrate proposes

212
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,900
that the families who don't

213
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,220
want to have children should be fined.

214
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,300
Nonsense.

215
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,100
Your Highness,

216
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,540
Miss Mei wants to play on a swing.

217
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,100
Allow her to do so.

218
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,260
Your Highness,

219
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,620
the prefect of the Southwestern district
proposes that the wages of officials

220
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,380
who are below the county level
should be cut in half.

221
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,920
After all, in the remote
and backward place,

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,100
one doesn't need so much money.

223
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,340
Well,

224
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,460
then send the perfect to inspect
the remote and backward place

225
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,340
for half a year.

226
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,620
Afterward, tell me
how much we should cut.

227
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,060
Your Highness, Miss Mei wants to...

228
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,460
Allow her to do so.

229
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,020
Yes.

230
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,260
The Imperial College proposes...

231
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,860
Nonsense.

232
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,980
Miss Mei wants to...

233
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,540
Allow her to do so.

234
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,220
Your Highness.

235
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,900
No.

236
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,100
Miss Mei wants to...

237
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,660
Allow her to do so.

238
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,180
Yes.

239
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,300
The prefect
of the Southwestern district proposes...

240
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,900
Absurd!

241
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,580
Miss Mei wants to...

242
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,470
She can do anything

243
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,940
as long as she doesn't tear
down the Eastern Palace.

244
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,020
Allow her to do so.

245
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,260
Don't just look.

246
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,860
Have some. Try it.

247
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,420
No, these are all for you, Miss Mei.

248
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,980
Try it.

249
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,140
I'm afraid

250
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,580
we don't deserve it.

251
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,060
Your Highness,

252
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,500
the rioters on the execution ground

253
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,660
had poisoned themselves
before we could interrogate them.

254
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,140
Never mind.

255
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,220
I know well

256
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,340
who is loyal, who is not,

257
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,180
and who wants to harm me.

258
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,460
You know who they are?

259
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
When those officials impeached me,

260
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,140
they all said with certainty.

261
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Liu Qinyuan was the only one
who remained silent.

262
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,220
It's Liu Qinyuan?

263
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,100
He hides himself well.

264
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,820
But the rioters are dead.

265
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
We don't have any evidence.

266
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,540
Don't worry.

267
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,060
He's got many minions.

268
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,620
Sooner or later, he'll get exposed.

269
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,940
By the way,

270
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,980
have you taken care

271
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,860
of the things I asked you?

272
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,980
It's all been taken care of.

273
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,420
However,

274
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
it's just to celebrate
the Double-Seventh Day with Miss Mei.

275
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,740
Isn't what we prepared

276
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,060
a little too much?

277
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,380
Your Highness,

278
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,500
hold on.

279
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,460
If you are going that way,

280
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,540
you'll need this.

281
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,300
What is it?

282
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,300
The balm.

283
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,580
Why would I need that?

284
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,860
You will find out in a moment.

285
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,980
What are you doing?

286
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,700
Applying the balm.

287
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,260
You're a bodyguard
of the Eastern Palace.

288
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
You're afraid of this?

289
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm not.

290
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,780
Why is it so stinky?

291
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,500
Are you having beriberi again?

292
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,340
Nanbei.

293
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,740
Not me.

294
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,700
- It stinks.
- It's her.

295
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,380
Hurry, hurry.

296
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,700
- Close the door.
- Yes.

297
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,340
If you are suspicious of that maid,

298
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,780
why don't you just tell the Crown Prince

299
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,820
or the Empress?

300
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,100
If she's really Shengdong's princess,

301
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,340
they will for sure...

302
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,020
No.

303
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,580
Are you worried about Miss Mei?

304
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,380
Do you think if people find

305
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,540
out the maid's true identity,

306
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,980
Douzi and the whole Mei Family

307
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,620
will be able to survive?

308
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,420
But she may do harm to the Crown Prince.

309
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,460
Of course, I know.

310
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,220
You may leave now.

311
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,020
Yes.

312
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,070
[Pastries]

313
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,570
[Cup]

314
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,400
[Medicine]

315
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,140
You... Don't come over here.

316
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,100
I'll cut your head off if you come here.

317
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,140
I will remove your guts.

318
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,500
I will cut your head off first.

319
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,540
Then I'll cut your tail.
Finally, I'll cut you into pieces.

320
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,140
I'll fry you and stew you.

321
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,340
I'll braise you.

322
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,500
She was so afraid of snakes.

323
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,100
Yet she still tried to protect me.

324
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,820
It's okay. It's okay.

325
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,260
It'll be okay.

326
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,740
It'll be okay.

327
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,460
It hurts.

328
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,940
A pastry will help.

329
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,460
Right.

330
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,140
Have some pastries.

331
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,020
There are no more visible wounds.

332
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,180
But there's still bruising
under the skin.

333
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,620
You don't have to be so careful.

334
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,020
Of course, I do.

335
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,820
His Highness says

336
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,260
we must take care of you
till you are fully healed.

337
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,380
Hurry, hurry.

338
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,380
Pastries.

339
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,460
Have some pastries.

340
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,300
Don't worry.

341
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,700
You will feel much better

342
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,740
after my little cutie
sucks it out for you.

343
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,940
I'm already better.

344
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,980
Don't worry.

345
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,060
It is very cute.

346
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,420
No, no. I'm good.

347
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,740
Tonight is the night of the full moon.

348
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,300
Once my little cutie gets full,

349
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,260
it'll go back to reunite
with its siblings.

350
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,340
No need, really.

351
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,500
Tonight is the night of the full moon.

352
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,900
How come I forgot about that?

353
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,780
Should I go back to Mei Daidai
and give it another try?

354
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,500
Thank you, Guard Xingshi

355
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,660
for delivering me the medicine so late.

356
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,620
Today at the Chongwen Academy,

357
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,460
I noticed you were rubbing your wrists.

358
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,620
I figured you were not fully recovered.

359
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,620
It's nothing.

360
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,580
Don't worry about it.

361
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,620
How are your three adoptive fathers?

362
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,260
They're safely back home.

363
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,380
How do you know

364
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,500
that they are my three fathers?

365
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,860
It's not so hard to find out.

366
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,420
By the way,

367
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,620
did they ever tell you

368
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,500
where you were found back at the time?

369
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,260
In the Black Dog Alley, I suppose.

370
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,740
I can't remember exactly.

371
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,740
When you were found,

372
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,820
how old were you?

373
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,300
I... I don't remember things
from my childhood.

374
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,060
By the way,

375
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,580
speaking of the Black Dog Alley,

376
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,340
I brought you some snacks today.

377
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,620
You grew up in the alley.

378
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,820
I'm sure you will love these snacks.

379
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,060
What a familiar smell!

380
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,900
Try them.

381
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,140
It reminds me of when I was a kid.

382
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,340
Eat more if you like.

383
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,900
This handkerchief...

384
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,500
Well,

385
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,820
the water in the teapot is getting cold.

386
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,740
I'll make another pot.

387
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,740
Why does he care so much
about Douzi's background?

388
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,540
Mei Daidai, I'm back.

389
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,940
Mei Daidai.

390
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,340
She also prepared me stinky tofu.

391
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,140
It's from Ms. Xing's.

392
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,500
How does she know about Ms. Xing
from the Black Dog Alley?

393
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,540
Mei Daidai?

394
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,940
Let's try it again while it's full moon.

395
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,500
Maybe we can
switch our bodies back this time.

396
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,020
Douzi?

397
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,980
Miss Mei.

398
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,540
Thank you, Guard Xingshi,
for the medicine.

399
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,980
Mei, I'll take my leave then.

400
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,140
Oh no.

401
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
I just mentioned switching bodies.

402
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,100
He must have heard me.

403
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,020
It is such a rare thing.

404
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,420
When people hear you say such a thing,

405
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,940
they'll think you are joking.

406
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,300
Who would think otherwise?

407
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,060
You're right.

408
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,900
Then what was he doing here?

409
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,500
To deliver me medicine.

410
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,580
Are you hurt? Let me see your wounds.

411
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,660
It's okay.

412
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,780
That's not the point.

413
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
The point is
breaking into a lady's room at night

414
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,660
is considered a capital crime.

415
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,500
Do you think Xingshi
is such a reckless person?

416
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,020
Did he risk his life

417
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,900
just to deliver me the medicine?

418
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,700
Then what was he doing here?

419
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,740
I think he was here
to find out about your background.

420
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,940
He kept asking me
about the Black Dog Alley.

421
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,060
But you're Douzi now.

422
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,100
It looks like that he's asking about me,

423
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,460
but actually, he's asking about you.

424
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,620
Why would he ask about you?

425
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,540
Even if he has a crush on me,

426
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,580
he doesn't have to
ask about my background.

427
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,420
So what if I grew up
in the Black Dog Alley

428
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,180
or the Grand Chancellor's Residence?

429
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,620
I don't think he's such a snob.

430
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,100
He has a crush on you?

431
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,660
When did you two

432
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,620
develop such a relationship?

433
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,700
Don't change the subject.

434
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,820
Tell me.

435
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,540
Why he is so interested
in your background?

436
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,300
He keeps asking me
about when you were a kid.

437
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,940
When I was a kid?

438
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,820
Why does he care?

439
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,500
This guy is so weird.

440
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,020
I think he just cares about you.

441
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,060
He doesn't mean you any harm.

442
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,060
Stop it.

443
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,460
I think he might just
be full of bad intentions.

444
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,740
Ever since I stole that pearl,

445
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,980
strange things never seem to end.

446
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,220
Think about the last time
you were wronged.

447
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,300
If it was Su Ruomei
who tried to harm you,

448
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,140
then why did
the jade pendant inexplicably

449
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,460
show up in our room?

450
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,460
And her maid.

451
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,180
She doesn't seem like a good person.

452
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,780
She doesn't

453
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,100
look like a normal maid at all.

454
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,900
The Grand Chancellor's daughter,
on the other hand,

455
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,460
acts and talks in a suspicious way.

456
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,500
It's from Ms. Xing's.

457
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,340
Let's try it again while it's full moon.

458
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,780
Maybe we can
switch our bodies back this time.

459
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,100
Switching bodies.

460
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
Switching bodies.

461
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,980
Looks like it's time to leave the palace

462
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,620
and meet an old friend.

463
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,060
I heard that Mei Yushan cooked
stinky food in the Eastern Palace.

464
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,780
People there suffered a lot.

465
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,060
When His Majesty
held the morning court this morning,

466
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,620
Mr. Zhang in the front row said

467
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,620
the Crown Prince smelled
of pig intestine.

468
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,620
The Crown Prince
has indulged Mei Yushan.

469
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,020
Looks like he's going to marry her.

470
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,420
If that happens,

471
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,740
the prophecy will be proved wrong

472
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,420
and no one can pressure him
to get married anymore.

473
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,180
All our efforts will be in vain.

474
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,940
If the Crown Prince is really
in love with Mei Yushan,

475
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,260
things will be easy.

476
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,660
What's your plan?

477
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Mei Yushan has seduced His Highness.

478
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,980
We have concrete evidence to prove that.

479
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,460
If we unite the officials
to report this to the imperial court,

480
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,700
the Crown Prince will be in trouble.

481
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,540
With the Crown Prince's temper,

482
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,460
if he can't marry Mei Yushan,

483
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,860
will he be willing to marry anyone else?

484
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,300
- Right.
- Right.

485
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,940
- That's brilliant.
- That's brilliant.

486
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,580
Your Highness, don't be mad.

487
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,860
Miss Mei is not who they say she is.

488
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,500
Absurd!

489
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,860
What's the matter?

490
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,780
Your Highness.

491
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
These flowers are nice.

492
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,700
Are they for me?

493
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,700
Well...

494
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,220
Get me a vase and put them in.

495
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,620
Okay.

496
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,380
Go ahead.

497
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,260
Let me see it.

498
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,900
Give it to me.

499
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,100
Show me.

500
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,820
Don't read it.

501
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,900
Let me see it.

502
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,940
Be careful.

503
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,620
Show me.

504
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,150
[Harbor evil intentions]

505
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,470
[The Grand Chancellor's daughter,
Mei Yushan]

506
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,650
[Bringing calamity
to the country and people]

507
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,520
[No decency]

508
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,750
[Misbehaving herself]

509
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,900
[Being harmful to society's morals]

510
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,870
[Offending public morals]

511
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,420
It's all nonsense.

512
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,780
Don't take it to heart.

513
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,300
I'm fine.

514
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,060
I'm not that kind of person
who has done something indecent,

515
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,140
offended public morals,

516
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,980
or misbehaved herself, right?

517
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,980
Yeah.

518
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,060
Right, exactly.

519
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,060
You are not.

520
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,980
It's okay.

521
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,380
How can a person with such bad manners

522
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,460
be the Crown Princess?

523
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,020
She should know it
when she looks in the mirror.

524
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,300
Not just any person

525
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,500
is worthy of His Highness.

526
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,700
She's the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

527
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,060
But she doesn't look like it.

528
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,820
She has no virtue or manner.

529
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,380
I feel bad for His Highness.

530
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,340
Finally done.

531
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,340
I got this.

532
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,420
So tired.

533
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,980
There.

534
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,060
Is that her?

535
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,980
Yes.

536
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,900
Look at her.

537
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,100
I heard the Grand Chancellor's daughter
will be chosen to be the Crown Princess.

538
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,340
This is unusual.

539
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,500
- She could never be the Crown Princess.
- Yeah.

540
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,460
That's the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

541
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,580
It is her.

542
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:48,900
Stop.

543
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,980
Don't step on it.

544
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,380
I... I stepped on it.

545
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,540
You stupid girl.

546
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,660
I already told you

547
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,620
when you go out,
you need to check the weather

548
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,100
and mind your step.

549
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,540
You have no manners.

550
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,980
Do you also think I have no manners?

551
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,020
Has your injury recovered?

552
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,380
Almost. I'm leaving.

553
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,100
Stop.

554
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,860
Without His Highness's permission,

555
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,180
you can't go anywhere.

556
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,820
Moreover,

557
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,220
I haven't diagnosed you yet.

558
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,620
I'm really healed.

559
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,380
I'll show you.

560
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,580
- Stop it.
- I can even run.

561
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,380
- I can spin around.
- Oh, please no.

562
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,340
- Injured bones need months to heal.
- I can also jump.

563
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,460
I can even jump now.

564
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,420
Be careful.

565
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,540
My herbs.

566
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,660
Mr. Bai is so gentle.

567
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,540
Little Diviner?

568
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Did that scare you?

569
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,780
Thank you for saving me, Little Diviner.

570
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,700
I have a feeling right now

571
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,340
that His Highness is coming armed

572
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,700
with burning anger.

573
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,620
How are your wounds?

574
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,180
Almost healed.

575
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,100
Come on.

576
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,500
His Highness is here.

577
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,100
Your Highness.

578
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,980
Your Highness.

579
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,980
What are you waiting for?

580
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,860
Invite Mr. Bai in for a cup of tea.

581
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,860
Yes.

582
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,860
You're not healed, yet you have
the energy to tear the house down?

583
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,380
I'm almost healed.

584
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,740
I don't think so.

585
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,780
Why else would you fall so suddenly?

586
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,460
It's... It's because the Grand Tutor

587
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,580
insisted that I had not recovered.

588
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,580
Patients...

589
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,140
So handsome.

590
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,660
should receive special treatment.

591
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,260
I...

592
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,940
Just put me down.

593
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,780
I want to hold you.

594
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Oh no.

595
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,380
This is so embarrassing.

596
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,700
I'll take my leave then.

597
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,540
I'll come another day.

598
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,220
Zuo,

599
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
brew the fine Jinjunmei black tea
that just arrived

600
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,420
for Mr. Bai.

601
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,340
Yes.

602
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm clearly not reconciled to it.

603
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,500
I envy him for being able

604
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,020
to express his feelings freely.

605
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,580
But there is a sense of relief.

606
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,820
If he really falls in love

607
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,500
with Douzi,

608
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,780
the prophecy about Shengdong's Princess

609
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,340
will be proved wrong.

610
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,300
If His Highness and Douzi get married,

611
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
what I foresaw

612
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,260
will be totally wrong.

613
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,340
Harder.

614
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,620
Yeah, keep him down.

615
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,550
[Wuer Martial Arts]

616
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,780
Back in Shengdong,

617
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,260
General Wang, have you heard

618
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,460
of the Moon Spirit Pearl?

619
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,620
For example,

620
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,980
can it make two people
switch their bodies?

621
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,700
I know it sounds crazy.

622
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,900
I heard it when I was a kid.

623
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,780
But it was so long ago
that I couldn't remember,

624
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,900
so I specially came to you
for confirmation.

625
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,900
Hearing you talk about it,

626
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,660
I do remember one thing.

627
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,620
About forty years ago,

628
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,300
our emperor then
gave the Moon Spirit Pearl

629
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,620
to his son-in-law.

630
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,900
His son-in-law loved
the princess very much.

631
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,260
So he made her a headdress
with the pearl.

632
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,780
He took the Moon Spirit Pearl

633
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,820
to find the famous jeweler
to make the headdress for her.

634
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,700
It didn't take long

635
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,980
before the emperor's son-in-law's
temperament changed dramatically.

636
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,660
He was as mad as a hatter.

637
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,500
The jeweler
was keeping crying out his grievances,

638
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,900
saying that he was the emperor's
son-in-law.

639
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,500
People called him a lunatic.

640
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,060
Looks like I was right.

641
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,860
However,

642
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,900
I'm not sure if it had anything to do

643
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,180
with the Moon Spirit Pearl.

644
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
My Princess,

645
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,700
I finally found you.

646
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,500
Why are you leaving?

647
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,380
To stop those people
from gossiping behind our backs.

648
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,580
All they can do is gossip.

649
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,420
If you leave,

650
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,340
you give those people
exactly what they want.

651
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,460
I'm using a fake identity now.

652
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,740
They all say I don't deserve you.

653
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,020
Then if they find out

654
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,220
that I'm a thief
who grew up in an alley,

655
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,900
won't they even...

656
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,940
I don't care about any of that.

657
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,180
Why do you care?

658
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,020
They're right.

659
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,420
I have no manners.

660
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,540
I don't deserve you.

661
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,660
Little Master.

662
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,580
Nonsense.

663
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,540
You are not inferior to anyone.

664
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,620
As for the manners,

665
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,980
you can learn them gradually.

666
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,460
Do you also think I have no manners,

667
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,780
and I need to learn about them?

668
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,340
Let go.

669
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,540
That's not what I meant.

670
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,860
As for the manners,
if you don't like it,

671
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,820
you don't have to learn.

672
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,060
I'm someone

673
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,860
who was born

674
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,780
with a wild and free soul.

675
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,020
I can't learn those manners.

676
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,540
Besides, I'm just a civilian.

677
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,100
I'm just like Little Diviner,

678
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,060
who came to the palace by accident.

679
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,020
As for you, Your Highness,

680
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,940
I never want to be with you.

681
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,340
I know don't deserve you.

682
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,700
What do you mean by that?

683
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,380
Are you mad at me or...

684
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,260
I...

685
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,420
I'm not mad at you.

686
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,900
I... I want to go back
to the Guixiu Pavilion.

687
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,100
See her back.

688
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,700
Yes.

689
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,900
I'm actually mad at myself.

690
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,180
Learning without thinking is labor lost.

691
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,780
Thinking without learning is idle.

692
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,820
When seeing a worthy person,
think of following in his footsteps.

693
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,460
When seeing the unwise ones,
examine yourself internally.

694
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,820
You can always learn from others.

695
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,020
Choose the good and follow them,

696
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,380
and correct those that are not good.

697
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,660
I'm talking to you.
When will you give it back?

698
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,020
Stop pestering me.

699
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,380
I'll give you.

700
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,140
How long has it been?

701
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,180
What are you talking about?

702
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,220
No.

703
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,260
Shuo, hurry up.

704
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,020

Get out of my way.

Come here.

You're cheating again.

707
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,300
Give it back to me.

708
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,460
Didn't I tell you not to lend it to him?

709
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,860
Get it back or you'll never get it.

710
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,660
- Give it back.
- No, I won't.

711
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,780
Don't run.

712
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,540

Your Highness, Miss Mei was recently

735
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,140
summoned to the Huacai Hall
by Her Majesty

736
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,500
to learn manners.

737
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,580
What manners?

738
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,660
I'm sure Her Majesty
can read Your Highness's mind.

this is to prepare for your marriage.

741

You may leave.

742
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,380
I'll take my leave then.
