181
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,820
Jade... jade pendant?

182
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,500
I have no idea.

183
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,900
Please give the pearl back to me now.

184
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,620
Let me find my jade pendant first,

185
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,420
then we'll talk.

186
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,380
I'll tell you.

187
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,780
I'll help you find the jade pendant.

188
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,060
You give me the pearl first.

189
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,940
You took my jade pendant

190
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,020
and still dare
to negotiate terms with me?

191
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,860
About the jade pendant, I...

192
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,500
Sir.

193
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,980
Sir, may I have
the address of your residence?

194
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,100
Someone will deliver
the kids to you later.

195
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,260
Please come with me.

196
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,500
Sir,

197
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,140
according to the rules,
you need to sign and seal the deal.

198
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,620
Payment must be settled in full,

199
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,660
and no refunds or exchanges are allowed.

200
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,220
Dong Xi,

201
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,780
you go with him.

202
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,220
Please.

203
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,980
Since you have other matters
to attend to,

204
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,260
I won't disturb you further.

205
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,500
Please return the pearl to me.

206
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,900
I lost it.

207
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,460
You...

208
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,980
Sir.

209
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,980
Sir, please come this way.

210
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,500
The more I look at him,

211
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
the less he seems
like an ordinary buyer.

212
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,340
Buying and selling private slaves
violates the law of the country.

213
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,620
Whoever dares to sign

214
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,860
should be tested.

215
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,300
Tell our people to get ready.

216
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,540
He called for backup.

217
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,860
What are you waiting for?

218
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,060
Quickly, get someone
to clean up the scene.

219
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,940
I'd like to see

220
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,380
who can walk out this door today.

221
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,940
Yes, sir.

222
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,900
It was my fault about the jade pendant.

223
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,820
Can you please be the bigger person

224
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,260
and forgive me this time?

225
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,020
The Moon Spirit Pearl might be on him.

226
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,220
I can't let him leave.

227
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,540
Why can't I find it?

228
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,740
Could it be hidden in his shoe?

229
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,180
Are you okay?

230
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,940
Is your leg okay?

231
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,060
There's nothing in this shoe.

232
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,380
Is it in the other shoe?

233
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,820
Are you plotting something against me?

234
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,900
I'm not.

235
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,340
Let's see if you will take it off.

236
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
I missed it twice.

237
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,300
This body is really useless.

238
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,820
What is that sound?

239
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,020
What sound?

240
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,220
There's no sound.

241
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,220
There is.

242
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,300
Are you done
visiting the disaster victims?

243
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
If you are, leave quickly.

244
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,940
- No, there's the sound of a pig.
- Go now.

245
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,980
Sir,

246
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,300
everything is prepared.

247
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,860
About the silver taels...

248
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,210
The relief organization was meant

249
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,220
to aid the people and save lives.

250
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,460
You receive salaries from the court

251
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,460
and are supported by the people,

252
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,490
yet you take advantage
of the natural disaster

253
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,030
to plunder the victims,

254
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,700
engage in human trafficking,

255
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,940
and even secretly raise assassins.

256
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,220
You are truly audacious.

257
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,860
Sir, if you insist
on making things difficult for me,

258
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,940
then I'll have to forcibly
detain you here

259
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,380
for tea.

260
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,820
Um, I have something to attend to.

261
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,860
I'll take my leave now.

262
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,060
Miss Mei,
you seem to be in quite a rush.

263
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,020
What's the matter?

264
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,980
You don't want to return my pearl

265
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,540
yet you want me to stay here
to take the beating with you?

266
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,460
If you don't want to get hurt,
stay by my side.

267
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,820
I'll protect you.

268
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,940
You think you lot

269
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,860
can detain me?

270
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,540
Go!

271
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,140
Protect my foot.
I better hurry up and find her.

272
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,780
Where's that girl?

273
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,420
Let's go.

274
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,140
Capture him.

275
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,940
Don't move.

276
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,460
Sir, what should we do with him?

277
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,580
I'm curious who's backing you up,

278
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,740
allowing you to be so arrogant.

279
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,740
You'd be scared if I told you.

280
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,300
My master is working
at the Ministry of Personnel.

281
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,620
So it's the Ministry of Personnel, huh?

282
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,460
No wonder the national treasury

283
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,980
can't fill this bottomless pit.

284
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,340
The superintendent
of the relief organization

285
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:08,820
is unforgivable.

286
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,020
Take him away.

287
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,620
Don't move.

288
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,980
Step back, all of you.

289
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,860
Don't push me.

290
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,340
- Stop looking.
- Step back.

291
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,220
Step back.

292
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,580
Let's go.

293
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,900
Listen.

294
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,220
The Moon Spirit Pearl
is definitely on him.

295
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,460
Maybe you can think of another solution.

296
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,660
How can I meet the Crown Prince
in my current state?

297
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,900
Besides,

298
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,420
there's another matter now,

299
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,060
which is even more urgent
than swapping our bodies back.

300
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,020
What's the matter?

301
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,260
Tomorrow is the day
I enter the palace to study.

302
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,580
If I can't get my body back
and can't enter the palace,

303
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,900
not only will you be punished,

304
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,830
but the entire
Grand Chancellor's Residence

305
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,420
will be implicated.

306
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:04,920
What

307
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,940
does the Grand Chancellor's Residence
have to do with me?

308
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,180
If the Grand Chancellor's Residence
is implicated,

309
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,100
will the Grand Chancellor's daughter
be in trouble?

310
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,500
Yes.

311
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,660
The Grand Chancellor's daughter
is you now.

312
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,900
What should we do then?

313
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,980
As it stands,
you will have to go in my place.

314
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,290
Then, get the pearl
from the Crown Prince

315
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,060
to swap our bodies back.

316
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,020
Me?

317
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,140
I won't go,

318
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,100
absolutely not.

319
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,460
I won't even be able

320
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,180
to survive an hour in the palace.

321
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,900
I refuse to go.

322
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,500
f you don't enter the palace
and see the Crown Prince,

323
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,900
how will we find the Moon Spirit Pearl?

324
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,620
If you agree,

325
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,980
I will accompany you into the palace

326
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,020
and ensure your safety.

327
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,940
Little Bean,

328
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,180
I heard there are a lot of treasures
in the palace.

329
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,380
Why don't you seize the opportunity...?

330
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,700
Don't listen to your First Father.

331
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,900
All you need to do
is to get your body back

332
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,460
and return safely.

333
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,140
If you ask me,

334
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,660
going
to the Grand Chancellor's Residence

335
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,060
and being the young lady there
sounds pretty good.

336
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,900
Why are you so annoying?

337
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,100
Come here.

338
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,620
Come over.

339
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,740
Let's make a deal.

340
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,330
After we get the pearl
and switch our bodies back,

341
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,660
I'll leave the palace immediately

342
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,780
and won't stay a moment longer.

343
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,260
I've checked

344
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,420
and that pearl is indeed missing.

345
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,860
Forgive my incompetence.

346
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,260
I'll send someone right away

347
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,700
to break the legs of those thieves.

348
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,500
You are still so impatient.

349
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,900
Don't alert them just yet.

350
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,700
Keep a close watch on those four

351
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,900
and see what they're up to.

352
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,540
Yes, sir.

353
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,380
Sir,

354
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,900
why did you take the blow
for the scoundrel's son?

355
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
It was just a ruse.

356
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,220
Firstly, it was to let you escape,

357
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,460
and secondly, it was to demonstrate
my loyalty to the Crown Prince,

358
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,100
thereby earning his trust further.

359
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,460
Did you truly believe
you could harm the Crown Prince?

360
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,580
You really overestimated yourself.

361
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,900
After the Battle of Shengdong,

362
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,100
upon his grandfather's demise

363
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,100
and the current Emperor's ascension,

364
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,500
he enlisted dozens
of top martial artists to train him.

365
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,340
He keeps his skills concealed.

366
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,100
Even I

367
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,900
may not necessarily be his match.

368
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,780
Sir, I'm worried that you...

369
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,300
Though bows and arrows
can shoot from afar,

370
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,740
they cannot kill up close.

371
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,100
Being by the Crown Prince's side

372
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,220
is not only an opportunity
for assassination

373
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,340
but also a way to find the princess.

374
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,580
Yes, sir.

375
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,740
The two short swords
have already been exposed.

376
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
The sword shop needs to be dealt with
as soon as possible.

377
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,650
[Grand Chancellor's Residence]

378
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,540
Shan.

379
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Wait.

380
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,340
I... Shan.

381
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,380
As your mother, there are
a few more things I need to tell you.

382
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,540
With your proud spirit, you
never engage in conflicts with others.

383
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,100
But the palace
is different from our residence.

384
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,740
You must be extremely cautious.

385
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,460
- This child...
- Stop nagging.

386
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,500
I'm in a hurry to get to the palace.

387
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,300
Miss, do you dislike me now?

388
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,980
Who will take care of you in the future?

389
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,700
- That won't be necessary, thank you.
- Miss.

390
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,660
You should head back inside.

391
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,300
I'm leaving now.

392
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,500
Take care.

393
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,660
Shan.

394
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,580
Shan.

395
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,660
Shan, you must remember what I told you.

396
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,740
[Mrs. Mei]

397
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,900
[Mrs. Mei]
Shan has always been calm

398
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,340
[Mrs. Mei]
and composed.

399
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,740
[Mrs. Mei]
She's never been so impatient.

400
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,950
[Mrs. Mei]

401
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,660
[Grand Chancellor Mei]

402
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,900
[Grand Chancellor Mei]
Why are you crying?

403
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,320
[Grand Chancellor Mei]
Shan going to the palace

404
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,180
to become the Crown Princess

405
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,340
is a good thing.

406
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,140
You used to complain
that she wasn't eager

407
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,900
and proactive enough.

408
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
But now, she's proactive.

409
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,300
Why are you crying?

410
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,660
Come on, be good.

411
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,300
Be strong, don't cry.

412
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,180
You can come out now.

413
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,460
Careful.

414
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,850
[Jixi Palace]

415
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,450
[Stars]

416
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,540
Sir, His Highness has arrived.

417
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,740
He's here?

418
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,180
Bai Ye!

419
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,020
Where is he?

420
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,260
Bai Ye!

421
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,580
Bai Ye!

422
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,420
Bai Ye, come out now!

423
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,820
Bai Ye!

424
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,260
Where are you? Bai Ye!

425
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Are you done hiding? Come out!

426
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,900
Bai Ye, come out quickly!

427
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,700
- Here comes this move again.
- Here comes this move again.

428
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,820
You use this move
to ambush me every time.

429
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,980
You saw through it again.

430
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,500
This is your birthday present.

431
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,580
Here's your birthday present.

432
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

433
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,380
Quick, take a look.

434
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,860
Do you like it?

435
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,260
I do! It's a fan.

436
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,340
I'm glad you like it.

437
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,300
Let's go eat something.

438
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,980
Sure!

439
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,380
Do you want it
If not, I'll throw it away.

440
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,980
I... I want it.

441
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,060
I... I want it.

442
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,700
Thank you.

443
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,620
It's been over ten years

444
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,460
and you're still so good to me.

445
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,580
If it weren't for me,

446
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,260
you wouldn't have to be
under house arrest for so many years.

447
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,020
This just makes me
feel even more guilty.

448
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,020
You're quite chatty today.

449
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,140
Come, join me for a cup of tea.

450
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,980
I do want to join you

451
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,140
but I have unfinished business today.

452
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,300
How about this?

453
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,580
I'll come to see you another day.

454
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,900
Okay.

455
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,780
Also,

456
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,260
happy birthday!

457
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,500
Have a seat.

458
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,420
Why do you want to see me?

459
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,340
I only came out because of you.

460
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,460
If my mother finds out I skipped school,

461
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,620
I'll definitely be punished.

462
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,620
Yesterday, I tried to decipher
the celestial phenomena again.

463
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,820
Do tell.

464
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,380
What?

465
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,620
You mustn't lie to me.

466
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,340
Every word I say is true.

467
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,780
How is it possible? I am the one

468
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,060
who will cause
the downfall of the nation.

469
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,100
Keep this between us, okay?

470
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,540
Have you heard?

471
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,180
Prophet Bai Ye predicted

472
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,980
that the Crown Prince would fall in love
with the Princess of Shengdong

473
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,800
and become the Emperor
who would bring about

474
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,380
the downfall of the nation.

475
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,660
Then, the Crown Prince...

476
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,220
Let me tell you,
if we don't depose the Crown Prince,

477
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,260
Jixi will surely perish.

478
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,020
Have you heard?

479
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,220
It's being spread everywhere now

480
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,170
that the Crown Prince will become

481
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,620
the Emperor who brings about
the downfall of the nation.

482
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,700
You better stop talking nonsense.

483
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,580
We'll end up dead.

484
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,540
By the divine will of heaven,
the Emperor decrees:

485
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,380
Bai Ye, eldest son
of Commander Bai, though gifted,

486
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,900
lacks discipline,

487
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,460
displaying rebellious tendencies.

488
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,020
Henceforth, he is to be confined
to Astronomical Bureau.

489
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,900
During this house arrest, he's forbidden
to leave Astronomical Bureau.

490
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,900
He shall be released
when he turns sixteen.

491
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,660
Please obey His Majesty's order.

492
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,180
Anyone spreading rumors

493
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,820
shall be executed without exception.

494
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

495
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,100
Your Highness,

496
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,620
I swear

497
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,460
that I will definitely lift
the curse for you.

498
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,000
You know well that the officials

499
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,740
at the Ministry of Personnel
are constantly targeting you,

500
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,420
why don't you learn
to temper your aggression?

501
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,860
[The Empress]
Today, in the court,

502
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,100
[The Empress]

503
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,020
[The Empress]
an order was given to raid

504
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,380
Wang Shujuan's residence,

505
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,340
causing a stir
even in the Imperial Harem.

506
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,980
I was just warning those embezzlers

507
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,300
about the consequences.

508
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,620
The incident at the relief organization

509
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,580
surely isn't solely
the fault of Wang Shujuan.

510
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,660
Yao,

511
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
I know you are upright

512
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,700
and can't stand these dirty deeds.

513
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,860
But you have to understand

514
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,460
that if you are too strict,
you'll have no allies.

515
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,740
Your father has been Emperor
for more than ten years.

516
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,020
Do you think he can't tell who is loyal
and who is treacherous?

517
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,860
Today, you dismissed a minister.

518
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
It will surely cause panic in the court,

519
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,900
which will be
even more detrimental to you.

520
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,340
It'll just be another round
of impeachment.

521
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,260
Mother.

522
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,060
Father and you have taught me
Confucian classics since childhood,

523
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,880
emphasizing the importance

524
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,860
of loyalty, filial piety,
integrity, and courage.

525
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,940
If I were to tolerate
people like Wang Shujuan

526
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,500
just because I fear impeachment,

527
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,620
wouldn't that be a betrayal

528
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,900
of your teachings?

529
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,660
You...

530
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,980
Never mind.

531
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,540
These

532
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,140
are issues you must face.

533
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,420
Oh yes.

534
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,230
Starting today,
you should return to Chongwen Academy

535
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,780
to avoid attracting too much attention.

536
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,180
It's a good opportunity

537
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,910
to spend a few days

538
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,780
with those young ladies
who entered the palace.

539
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,540
During this period, you don't need
to deal with state affairs anymore.

540
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,540
Mother.

541
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,420
Stop talking.

542
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,580
Give those old fellows a break,
will you?

543
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,550
[Pure thoughts]

544
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,470
[Emulate the actions of the wise]

545
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,940
Eat with me.

546
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,980
Dig in.

547
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,460
You better not eat these things.

548
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,740
Why?

549
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,980
I don't eat things
that have been touched by hands,

550
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,740
nor do I use
other people's plates and bowls.

551
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,780
It's unhygienic.

552
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,260
You're currently using my body,

553
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,020
so you better show
some restraint for me.

554
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,060
Isn't this cup clean?

555
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,780
This is rare.

556
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,700
It's the first time
I've seen a maid disdain food

557
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,540
and the master kindly persuades her.

558
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,620
If I didn't know
she's the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

559
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,330
I would've thought

560
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,860
she was some uneducated girl
from who knows where.

561
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,580
Eunuch Song has arrived.

562
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,900
Where are your manners?

563
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,900
- Greetings, Eunuch Song.
- Greetings, Eunuch Song.

564
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,260
Ladies,

565
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,420
please.

566
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,520
Chongwen Academy
has not opened its doors

567
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,540
to female students for many years.

568
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,860
It is fortunate
that Her Majesty is open-minded

569
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,060
and has allowed you to enter the palace

570
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,900
to study with the princes.

571
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,420
Regardless of your fathers' ranks,

572
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,900
once you enter Chongwen Academy,
your status will no longer matter.

573
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,380
You must strictly adhere
to the rules of the academy,

574
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,220
or you will be expelled from the palace.

575
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,860
So much talking.

576
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,380
Now, the first thing
upon entering the palace

577
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,820
is to have your portraits painted

578
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,500
and hung in the hall
alongside those of the princes

579
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,860
for future generations to admire.

580
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,100
Please, ladies,
take your scholar's attire.

581
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,660
Strange.

582
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,820
What is this?

583
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,420
Surely you're familiar
with wheat ears, aren't you?

584
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,420
Attentive
and knowledgeable about grains,

585
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,890
no wonder the young lady
from the Mei Family

586
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,740
is favored by Her Majesty.

587
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,780
I've never worn
such an ugly outfit in all my life.

588
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,620
Do you think I look good in this?

589
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,020
Do you think it looks better
with or without the belt?

590
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,100
It doesn't look good
whether you wear the belt or not.

591
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,900
You look even worse.

592
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,100
Anyway, it's your own body.

593
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,040
Within the time it takes
for an incense stick to burn,

594
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,140
change into the scholar's attire,

595
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,020
place the wheat ears
on both sides of the body,

596
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,660
maintain an elegant posture,

597
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,820
- and do not move the body
- Miss.

598
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,100
- to complete the painting.
- Please put this on.

599
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,950
Those who fail to meet the standard
will be considered

600
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,700
as having unkempt attire

601
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,140
and will not be allowed
to participate in the painting.

602
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,380
The paintings upon entering the palace
will be permanently preserved.

603
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,580
Please pay attention to your posture.

604
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,020
Her butt is definitely padded.

605
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,940
I've worn these before
when practicing martial arts.

606
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,620
So her butt is fake.

607
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,480
She's truly living up to her name,

608
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,180
Zhuang Yangyang.
[*meaning to pretend]

609
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,020
Miss.

610
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,540
Does it not hurt?

611
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,380
Get it out now.

612
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,780
It does hurt a bit.

613
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,980
She's still pretending.

614
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,220
It does hurt a bit.

615
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,820

635

You keep moving around,
I can't paint like this.

636
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,780
It's itchy. Come and try it yourself.

637
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,060
You... You're too much.

638
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,340
How can I paint like this?

639
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,140
This is clearly because the clothes
are not clean.

640
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,540
What can I do about it?

641
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,180
This scholar's attire

642
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,700
was prepared
by the Directorate for Royal Clothing

643
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,500
at Her Majesty's command,

644
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,540
and the wheat ears were also prepared
by Her Majesty's order.

645
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,340
Only you, Miss Mei,
find it unsatisfactory.

646
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,100
There's nothing unusual

647
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,900
with the other young ladies.

648
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,260
You... You are...

649
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,500
- Look, she's moving too.
- You...

650
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,140
Miss Mei, you've just entered the palace
and are already giving me a hard time.

651
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,180
If we miss a painting,

652
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,740
how will I explain it?

653
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,660
What does that have to do with me?

654
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,860
You...

655
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,180
Who taught you this undisciplined

656
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,100
and arrogant behavior?

657
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,900
Look at you. You don't sit properly

658
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,020
and you don't stand properly.

659
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,980
Stand up!

660
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,980
You...

661
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,620
Eunuch Song,

662
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,060
it wasn't specified which artist
should paint the portraits.

663
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,940
Anyone can do it, right?

664
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,580
That's right.

665
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,220
However, with four artists
and four young ladies,

666
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,460
if an artist refuses to paint,

667
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,020
then your young lady
won't have a painting to frame.

668
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,740
If the artist refuses to paint,

669
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,380
I am willing to give it a try.

670
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,420
You?

671
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,180
What can a maid like you paint?

672
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,940
No need to push yourself too hard,

673
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,220
If I remember correctly,

674
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,100
just now, you said anyone could paint.

675
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
We're new to the palace
and are unfamiliar with the rules here,

676
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,420
so we consider your words
as precious advice.

677
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,740
The Mei Family is indeed remarkable.

678
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,500
Even a little maid is so eloquent.

679
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,380
Fine, I'll let you paint.

680
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,620
But let me remind you,

681
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,860
these paintings are to be presented
to Her Majesty.

682
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,140
If your painting displeases Her Majesty,

683
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,420
I won't be able to save you.

684
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,660
You can do it.

685
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,420
I'm painting a picture of myself.

686
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,220
