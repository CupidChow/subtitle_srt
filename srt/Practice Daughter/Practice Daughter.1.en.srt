185
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,220
- Help me pick one.
- Another round.

186
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,060
- Come on, one more time.
- Bite it.

187
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,700
Your Highness, you see,

188
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,220
among these exhibition halls,

189
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,740
the security system of the Guanque Hall

190
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,060
is the most rigorous.

191
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,060
At present,

192
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,380
[Guanque Hall]
we have already completed

193
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,940
the redeployment.

194
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Our mansion is not lacking in treasures,

195
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,540
so why do we have to come here
to see them?

196
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,660
It's just different.

197
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,380
Master and Madam spent money

198
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,940
to arrange this visit for us today,

199
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,940
just so that before entering
the palace for schooling,

200
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,460
the Crown Prince
could have a good impression of you.

201
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,540
Don't let those young ladies
steal the lead.

202
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,180
One should view
the exhibition in silence,

203
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,700
this is etiquette.

204
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,140
His Highness the Crown Prince
has arrived.

205
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,020
Miss, the Crown Prince.

206
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,620
Well...

207
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,500
First Father.

208
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,780
Look.

209
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,340
Hurry and disable the alarm system.

210
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,140
Go now.

211
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,980
Yes, sir.

212
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,300
My brothers, scissors, please.

213
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,460
Let's split up.

214
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,220
Let's go.

215
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,620
Your Highness, please forgive us

216
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,740
for disturbing you.

217
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,980
It's a grave mistake.

218
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,380
Your Highness, look,

219
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,980
in this Guanque Hall,

220
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,300
there are forty-nine
hidden silk threads.

221
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,860
From top to bottom, they're everywhere.

222
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,540
The other end of the threads

223
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,940
is connected

224
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,340
to forty-nine hidden bells.

225
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,140
If even one thread is slightly touched,

226
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,020
the bells will ring loudly.

227
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,700
It's an inescapable trap.

228
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,500
Even if a bird flies in,

229
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,140
it won't be able to get out.

230
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,420
Indeed.

231
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,540
Your Highness,

232
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,340
what are your instructions?

233
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,900
The lines are asymmetrical.

234
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,300
It's merely a civilian museum

235
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,900
with few rare treasures,

236
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,500
yet this thief
has broken in repeatedly.

237
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,980
What are they after?

238
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,220
I'm not quite sure either.

239
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,620
But we've strengthened the security now.

240
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,460
That thief

241
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,700
won't dare to come again.

242
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,820
Your Highness,

243
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,420
this clay sculpture
was missing half a face

244
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,700
and was stored
in the warehouse for years.

245
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,740
This year, after finding
the right materials,

246
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,420
it was repaired

247
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,100
and only then was it put on display.

248
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,500
What is this?

249
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,860
I only know

250
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,940
that it is a war trophy seized

251
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,100
from the Battle of Shengdong
over ten years ago.

252
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,260
In terms of what exactly it is,

253
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,020
I...

254
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,580
This is the Domestic Cat Monster,

255
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,340
representing
the folk culture of Shengdong.

256
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,620
It symbolizes

257
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,260
the power that devours any misfortune
daring to invade our home.

258
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,260
Your Highness,

259
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,500
this is Miss Mei Yushan,
the daughter of Grand Chancellor Mei.

260
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,340
So you are the daughter
of the Mei Family.

261
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,570
Miss Mei, your knowledge
and accomplishments

262
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,580
are renowned throughout the capital.

263
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,500
Today, seeing you in person

264
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,740
makes me think that your reputation
is indeed well-deserved.

265
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,580
Your Highness, you flatter me.

266
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,060
I've simply read some folk books at home
when I was taking a break

267
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,420
from studying the Four Books
and Five Classics.

268
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,100
They just happened to contain records
about the Domestic Cat Monster.

269
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,140
This person is overly reserved and dull.

270
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,980
Her hairpin is particularly obtrusive.

271
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,060
I spoke too much
about my own interests just now...

272
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,460
Hairpin.

273
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,940
I apologize for being overly talkative.

274
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,500
I hope Your Highness can forgive me.

275
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,380
Symmetric.

276
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,820
If Your Highness is interested,

277
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,340
I would be happy to share a thing
or two with Your Highness.

278
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,020
Miss...

279
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,220
I hope Your Highness won't mind.

280
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,740
Miss...

281
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,220
Miss...

282
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,520
Since ancient times,
there has been a tradition

283
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,130
among the common folk

284
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,340
of burying stones
to protect their homes.

285
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,060
There's nothing I can do.

286
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,180
Banks use Pixiu as protection,
[*a mythical creature for wealth]

287
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,980
Taoist temples use swords,

288
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,700
and the liquor stores use gourds.

289
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,380
These are expressions
of various protective cultural symbols.

290
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,820
The Domestic Cat Monster
is one of them.

291
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,660
However,

292
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,340
Your Highness, don't you find

293
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,100
the eyes of this Domestic Cat Monster

294
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,460
somewhat peculiar?

295
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,460
Where are they?

296
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,660
They've all left.

297
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,740
Has His Highness also left?

298
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,940
The Crown Prince left the fastest.

299
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,100
Just now, I thought
he was different from others.

300
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,900
Oh well,

301
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,580
it's hard to find a kindred spirit.

302
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,460
The rare pearl of Shengdong,
named the Moon Spirit Pearl,

303
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,140
is a grain
of extraterrestrial meteorite.

304
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,520
[Shengdong]
Seventeen years ago, when Shengdong

305
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,940
was conquered by the Jixi Kingdom,

306
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,580
the Moon Spirit Pearl
fell into the stream.

307
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,840
It lay submerged for several years,

308
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,780
witnessing the passage of time
through seasons.

309
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,620
The Moon Spirit Pearl
was later salvaged by mountain dwellers

310
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,820
and used as a pawn in a game of weiqi,

311
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,620
rolling on the board for several years.

312
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,220
Eventually, it became...

313
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,930
[Little Bean]

314
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,500
What are you standing there for?

315
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,500
[First Father]
Be careful, there's a trap ahead.

316
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,020
First Father,

317
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,340
how many days has it been
since you last washed your feet?

318
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,060
I washed them last month.

319
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,180
[Third Father]
Sorted.

320
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,460
[Third Father]

321
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,940
[Second Father]

322
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,060
Second Father, Third Father,

323
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,340
watch out for the bells.

324
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,460
Impressive.

325
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,620
Perfect.

326
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Your Highness,
is something asymmetrical?

327
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,540
What's that sound?

328
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,220
[Guanyue Pavilion]

329
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,860
Your Highness.

330
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,540
Come over here quickly and help me.

331
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,100
You two,

332
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,260
hurry up and lift it up!

333
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
Put some effort into it!

334
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,980
Give it all you've got!

335
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,060
I'm about to give out.

336
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,140
Try harder.

337
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,080
[Guanque Hall]

338
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,740
At a time like this,

339
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,940
how come you are still eating?

340
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,860
Guys, lift it quickly!

341
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,020
It's really His Highness
the Crown Prince.

342
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,260
[Guanyue Pavilion]

343
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,980
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

344
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,060
What just happened?

345
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,220
[Suo Ruomei]
We have long admired Your Highness.

346
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,900
Hearing that Your Highness
is inspecting the repairs here today,

347
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,580
we summoned our courage
to request a pass from Her Majesty.

348
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,660
Mother?

349
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,780
[Zhuang Yangyang]
Your Highness,

350
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,100
we are all young ladies
picked by Her Majesty.

351
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
In two days,
we will enter the palace for studies.

352
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,060
Enter the palace for studies?

353
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,100
Your Highness, it's true.

354
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,460
Then who are you?

355
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,260
I am Su Ruomei, the daughter

356
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,340
of General Zhongwu Su Shenhai.

357
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,500
Help!

358
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,580
Miss Su, please don't come any closer.

359
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,380
Why are there so many mosquitoes?

360
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,940
Help!

361
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,780
Help!

362
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,860
What's going on here?

363
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,340
Um...

364
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,300
Miss Su probably

365
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,380
has attracted all the mosquitoes

366
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,300
within one li radius.

367
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,140
Let the Imperial Household Department
learn from this.

368
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,020
We could save
a lot of mosquito repellents in summer.

369
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
I've never seen

370
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,220
such an ugly treasure in my life.

371
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,380
Who cares?

372
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,060
As long as we can sell it.

373
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,780
If it weren't for the deal I brought in,

374
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,780
how would you all make your fortune?

375
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,980
That's a load of nonsense.

376
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,580
Burning charcoal and lighting fires

377
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,860
- are usually handled by palace maids.
- Someone's coming.

378
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,420
Us tender folks, we wouldn't know
about such things, would we?

379
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,340
Exactly.

380
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,580
Just now, I almost caught
a young palace maid,

381
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,220
but in the blink of an eye,
she managed to slip away.

382
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,540
If we don't handle this properly,

383
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,100
we'll definitely
end up with a thrashing.

384
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,260
Eunuch Song
is making things difficult for us.

385
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,820
Let's go quickly.

386
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,140
Eunuch Song is waiting.

387
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,220
Let's go.

388
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,540
[Little Sparrow]

389
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,020
I am Zhuang Yangyang,
the daughter of Zhuang Fucheng,

390
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,780
the Prefect of the Masters of Writing.

391
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

392
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Miss,

393
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,300
turns out they're all young ladies

394
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,700
who will enter the palace
for studies with you.

395
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,460
Look, they're all stepping forward
to introduce themselves.

396
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,140
Why don't you...?

397
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,500
A lady should present herself
with grace and dignity.

398
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,860
Even if it's at the behest
of my parents,

399
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,380
I wouldn't engage in such impropriety.

400
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,660
Her Majesty has allowed the maidens
to enter the palace for studies

401
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,460
with the intention of selecting
a consort for the Crown Prince.

402
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,260
If you don't showcase yourself well

403
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,020
and if the Crown Prince
happens to favor someone else,

404
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,260
won't your position
as the Crown Princess be at risk?

405
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,580
Though he holds
the esteemed title of Crown Prince,

406
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,980
I have no feelings for him.

407
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,860
Since I have no feelings,

408
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,940
how can I pretend

409
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,060
or act out of character?

410
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,740
Look at that young lady over there.

411
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,380
Isn't she just like me?

412
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,380
Calm and composed,

413
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,940
completely unflappable.

414
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,260
This is the demeanor
we should all uphold.

415
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,810
[Huang Yuanyuan]

416
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,210
I am Huang Yuanyuan,

417
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,260
the daughter of General Huang Qi
from the northern frontier.

418
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,940
I'm here to pay respects
to Your Highness.

419
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,860
I'm not one for words,

420
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,420
so instead, I'll perform

421
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,940
a unique skill of our family,

422
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,300
the Huang's Fist.

423
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,140
Are you done?

424
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,340
Yes.

425
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,500
You look great.

426
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,100
Hold this.

427
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,300
One, two, three. Let's do this.

428
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,940
Your Highness,

429
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,020
Grand Tutor Zhou Liang
seeks an audience.

430
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,260
Let him in.

431
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,940
Halt.

432
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,900
Where do you think you are going?

433
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,860
Take this.

434
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm not going anywhere.

435
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,940
I'll beat you up.

436
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,180
Take it to His Highness.

437
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,660
Gao,

438
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,660
give her yours too.

439
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Here, take this.

440
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,620
Chop, chop, move.

441
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,020
[Guanyue Pavilion]

442
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,100
Greetings, Mr. Zhou.

443
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,340
[Grand Tutor]
Your Highness,

444
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
[Grand Tutor]

445
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,010
[Grand Tutor]
His Majesty has already arranged

446
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,620
the relief funds

447
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,020
and taken care
of some of the disaster victims.

448
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,980
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

449
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,140
Please take a seat.

450
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,540
Please, Your Highness.

451
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,220
Hurry, go now.

452
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,460
Currently, most of the victims
of the earthquake

453
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,820
have been resettled
in the outskirts of the capital city.

454
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,860
Some of the young, elderly,
and disabled individuals

455
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,890
have been placed
in the various relief organizations

456
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,500
within the city.

457
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,460
Go.

458
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,860
Give it to me.

459
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,220
Your Highness,

460
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,340
The recent earthquake has caused
widespread panic among the people.

461
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,500
According to rumors,

462
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,920
there have been reports

463
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,180
of some earthquake victims
going missing.

464
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,300
Are you trying to start a fire
or just cause trouble?

465
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,700
You seem like a troublemaker to me.

466
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,380
Stop it!

467
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,180
I'm silly and clumsy. Please forgive me.

468
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,620
I'll go back and reflect on my actions.

469
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,420
[Eunuch Song]
Stop right there.

470
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,500
You were asked to light a fire.

471
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,780
Look at what you did.

472
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,580
Yun, switch with her.

473
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,500
Give her the fan.

474
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,660
Go pour some liquor
for His Highness.

475
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,660
his pot is empty.

476
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,580
I'll go refill it.

477
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,180
Hold on.

478
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,660
Isn't there still half a pot left?

479
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,020
Why be so wasteful?

480
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,460
Hurry and go.

481
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,220
Give me some money.

482
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,380
I'm selling you a great opportunity.

483
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,540
What?

484
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,380
Pour some liquor for the Crown Prince.

485
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,060
You're so good-looking.

486
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,500
The prince will definitely like you.

487
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,100
Ridiculous.

488
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,900
Miss,

489
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,020
maybe you should go.

490
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,500
Have a few words with His Highness.

491
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,700
Otherwise, Master and Madam
will blame me again.

492
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,660
I'll end up losing my monthly pay.

493
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,820
Go, you should go now.

494
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,900
If you keep on talking,

495
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,780
you will lose this year's monthly pay!

496
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,820
Why are you still standing there?

497
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,660
Hurry up and go.

498
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,820
If you keep messing around,

499
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,940
I'll dock you three months' pay!

500
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,220
Come here.

501
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,660
Whose daughter is that?

502
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,980
How come she didn't perform just now?

503
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,460
That's Mei Yushan.

504
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,780
I heard

505
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,460
she's the top young lady
of the capital.

506
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,540
She's quite aloof.

507
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,660
She seems quite plain in her attire.

508
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,380
Guess her father
isn't a high-ranking official.

509
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,580
So, even she aims to become
the Crown Princess.

510
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,700
Going missing?

511
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,260
Pour the liquor.

512
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,450
The Court of Judicature and Revision

513
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,980
has already dispatched personnel
to investigate.

514
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,740
I hope Your Highness
can lay low for a while

515
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,660
to avoid unnecessary gossip.

516
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,100
I understand what you mean, Mr. Zhou.

517
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,420
Do you know

518
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,980
what's least valuable in the palace?

519
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,820
Tell us. What is it?

520
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,740
Stacks and stacks of gold ingots.

521
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,780
Gold ingots?

522
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,100
Those gold ingots
aren't much use to palace folk.

523
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,660
Guess what they're for.

524
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,020
Just tell us.

525
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,980
They're for propping up tables

526
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,340
and cracking walnuts!

527
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,940
Here you go, take it.

528
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,900
It is I who should fear the murmurs
of those powerful officials

529
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,180
to safeguard my position
as the Crown Prince.

530
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,580
Perhaps today, within the Linde Hall,

531
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,820
there were once again
a lot of accusations.

532
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,300
Pardon me for saying this.

533
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,540
The officials were doing it

534
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,100
for the sake of the nation
and its people.

535
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,380
For the nation and its people?

536
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,180
I think they're more worried
about their official status.

537
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,420
Every time there's a disaster in Jixi,

538
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,100
they submit petitions
to replace the Crown Prince.

539
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,780
It's all just the same old cliches.

540
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,100
This is for you.

541
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,540
Again.

542
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,700
This time is different from the past.

543
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,620
When the officials
brought up past events,

544
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,700
it was not to impeach Your Highness.

545
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,100
What do you mean?

546
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,500
It's...

547
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Well...

548
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,620
Symmetric.

549
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,140
Here's the thing.

550
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,620
Your Highness,

551
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,580
the officials said those things

552
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,980
to ensure the continuation
of our ancestors' lineage.

553
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,500
I hope you can understand.

554
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,620
I'll go first.

555
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,700
Don't push me!

556
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,500
Your Highness.

557
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,220
Don't push!

558
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,340
Miss, go now.

559
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,940
Go quickly!

560
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,340
Your Highness.

561
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,060
I humbly report

562
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,580
that a renowned fortune-teller
in the capital once said

563
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,940
that I bring prosperity and benefit
to my husband and children.

564
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,620
I wish to assist Your Highness

565
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
in all your endeavors
and alleviate your worries.

566
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,100
Your Highness.

567
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,700
Recently, I underwent
181 medical examinations

568
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,460
at the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

569
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,900
confirming excellent appearance

570
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,300
and lineage.

571
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,860
Your Highness,

572
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,340
I haven't had my fortune told,

573
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,900
nor have I undergone any examinations,

574
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,100
but I'm truly in good health.

575
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,500
How about I show you another set
of Huang's Fist techniques?

576
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,340
Again?

577
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,500
Why isn't the hairpin symmetrical?

578
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,780
This...

579
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,140
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

580
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,180
Hurry and leave.

581
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,340
Finally, that annoying hairpin is gone.

582
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,260
Excellent.

583
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,100
I, Mei Yushan,

584
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,740
have disturbed Your Highness
and the Grand Tutor.

585
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,540
I beg forgiveness from both of you.

586
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,620
The daughter of Grand Chancellor Mei

587
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,060
is exceptionally talented,

588
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,860
while General Huang's daughter

589
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,300
is also impressive.

590
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,420
If

591
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,910
we have the support

592
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,860
of both these civil
and military officials,

593
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,580
it would be like adding wings
to a tiger.

594
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,700
This way,

595
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,220
Your Highness will not...

596
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,940
Mr. Zhou,

597
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,420
are you suggesting
I sacrifice my dignity

598
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,580
to win over the fathers
of those wealthy young ladies?

599
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,700
Well...

600
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,220
I...

601
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,980
Please allow me
to humbly offer some opinions

602
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,660
in hopes of easing
Your Highness's worries.

603
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,860
If my words are not out of place,

604
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,620
may I request Your Highness
to grant me a cup of tea to drink?

605
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,700
Go ahead.

606
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,260
His Majesty is wise,

607
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,260
so he naturally wouldn't entertain
slanderous words.

608
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,940
Your Highness, you value integrity

609
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,380
and you refrain
from excessive rebuttals to rumors.

610
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,580
Consequently, these rumors
simmer like a pot of soup over fire,

611
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,260
the more ignored,

612
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,980
the more they bubble up.

613
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,500
However, since ancient times,
there are laws of the country

614
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,980
and rules for households.

615
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,780
I believe

616
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,540
that for the peace of the court,

617
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,380
it's necessary to punish officials
who mislead the public.

618
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,180
If anyone dares to bring up
such matters again,

619
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,820
they should be immediately dismissed
from their post.

620
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,260
With the constraint of punishment,

621
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,140
those who spread gossip

622
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,100
won't dare to speak recklessly.

623
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,620
Well said, Miss Mei.

624
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,420
Accompany His Highness for tea.

625
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,060
Your Highness, I will take my leave now.

626
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,260
No matter how dignified
and intelligent she appears,

627
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,260
it's all for the position
of Crown Princess.

628
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,820
I am different from them.

629
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,340
There's no difference.

630
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,060
These officials' daughters act coy

631
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,980
and put on various facades

632
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,940
all for one purpose,

633
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,060
which is rather disappointing.

634
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,100
These two are acting strangely.

635
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,460
Is there something wrong
with their eyes?

636
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,340
After all this fuss,

637
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,180
the Crown Prince
hasn't even looked at her properly.

638
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,660
Yet, she doesn't seem bothered.

639
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,100
Maybe I should lend her a hand.

640
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,820
Your Highness, please forgive me.

641
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,060
Which superintendent
are you working under?

642
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,620
Superintendent Zhao.

643
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,900
Which Superintendent Zhao?

644
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,420
There's no superintendent

645
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,340
with the surname Zhao in the palace.

646
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,540
I remembered it wrong.

647
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,900
His surname is Zhang,

648
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,900
Superintendent Zhang.

649
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,340
The pot is empty.

650
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,460
I'll go refill it.

651
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,900
The liquor...

652
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,940
Leave?

653
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,580
The liquor...

654
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,740
Leave?

655
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,540
Okay, I'll leave.

656
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,980
It's the lunar eclipse.

657
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,580
- Look.
- What's going on?

658
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,380
Where did the moon go?

659
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,660
Your Highness.

660
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,420
What's going on?

661
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,380
What do you mean?

662
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,580
What's wrong with the liquor?

663
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,900
How am I supposed to know?

664
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,660
Hurry, follow me.

665
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,940
This way. Move aside.

666
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,860
Quickly, let's go.

667
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,860
Hurry up!

668
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:17,980
Your Highness.

669
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,260
Get His Highness out of here quickly.

670
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,900
Yes, sir.

671
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,420
This way.

672
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,900
Don't leave.

673
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,220
What are you doing?
Don't grab my arm like that.

674
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,020
How can I explain myself if you left?

675
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,660
Leave me alone.

676
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,700
Take it if you want it.

677
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,700
Don't leave.

678
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,420
Let go of me.

679
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,220
You can't leave.
