00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Back off.

186
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,900
Evil girl, die.

187
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,940
Protect the Princess.

188
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,380
Little Master.

189
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,660
Little Master.

190
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,020
Little Master.

191
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,340
Little Master.

192
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,100
Little Master.

193
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,780
Your Highness.

194
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,420
Little Master, how are you feeling?

195
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,420
Little Master, how are you?

196
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,820
- Physicians.
- Little master.

197
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,020
- Your Highness.
- How are you?

198
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,740
Imperial physicians.

199
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,660
Your Highness.

200
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,260
Your Highness.

201
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,380
Little Master!

202
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,460
Help!

203
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,780
Lingxiao.

204
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,900
Stop it.

205
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,180
Lingxiao.

206
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,620
Lingxiao.

207
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,420
Mr. Bai.

208
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,820
Lingxiao. Lingxiao.

209
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,900
You can kill me if you want.

210
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,460
Don't pity me.

211
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,180
You don't have to be hostile
to me all the time.

212
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,180
We've achieved all this today

213
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,580
all thanks to your help.

214
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,060
Little Master.

215
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,860
His Highness?

216
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,340
Actually, I planned to take the Princess
out of the palace long ago.

217
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,540
Thanks to

218
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,420
your confronting the Crown Prince
in public

219
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
and revealing the Princess's identity,

220
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,580
I could burn my bridges

221
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,140
to call our former subordinates to come
into the palace and rescue our princess.

222
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,900
It's all thanks to you.

223
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,020
Otherwise, I wouldn't

224
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,500
have had such determination and courage.

225
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,700
Now,

226
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,020
Jixi's days are numbered.

227
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,980
Mr. Bai should move on
before it's too late.

228
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Imperial physicians!

229
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,540
When will they be here?

230
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,220
Little Master.

231
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,060
Little Master, wake up.

232
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
You mean

233
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,060
all this happened because of me?

234
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,300
I have found the Princess of Shengdong
in the prophecy

235
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,500
who will destroy our country.

236
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,660
She is the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

237
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,340
Mei Yushan.

238
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,100
No.

239
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,060
It's impossible.

240
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,620
I stopped them from being together

241
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,460
to prevent the prophecy
from coming true.

242
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,580
Why?

243
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,340
Why?

244
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,980
I took vows as a child

245
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,980
that I'd never allow the prophecy
to come true for the Crown Prince.

246
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,500
Who would've known

247
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,340
that the sinner to blame in the end

248
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,700
was me?

249
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,820
It was me!

250
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,420
Help!

251
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,620
Help.

252
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,220
Come with me, Your Majesty.

253
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,540
Where is the Crown Prince?

254
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,420
Your Majesty,

255
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,700
His Highness is severely injured

256
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,980
and put in jail.

257
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,100
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

258
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,500
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

259
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:34,140
Shengdong will win.

260
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,020
- Shengdong will win.
- Stay there.

261
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,860
- Shengdong will win.
- Don't move.

262
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,700
- Shengdong will win.
- Shengdong will win.

263
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,780
Look who that is.

264
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:51,820
- Shengdong will win.
- Shengdong will win.

265
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,420
Isn't that General Su Shenhai?

266
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,260
How come he wasn't arrested?

267
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,620
- Shengdong will win.
- Shengdong will win.

268
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,140
Father?

269
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:09,860
- Shengdong will win.
- Shengdong will win.

270
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,460
Make it quick.

271
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,100
Thank you.

272
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,300
Your Highness.

273
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,780
Your Highness.

274
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,580
This...

275
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,140
This must hurt a lot.

276
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,260
I know what you are thinking.

277
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,300
Do you think

278
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,300
this is all
because of your stubbornness?

279
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,700
No, Your Highness.

280
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,820
Don't think that way.

281
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,660
I made some porridge.

282
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,820
Here.

283
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,180
Drink it while it's warm.

284
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,420
Your Highness.

285
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,500
If you keep this up,

286
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,100
your body will fail.

287
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,900
Miss Mei...

288
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,700
I mean Douzi...

289
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,100
Douzi is under house arrest, too.

290
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,980
She begged Xingshi.

291
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,380
That's why I can come in
and take care of you.

292
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,060
If you don't eat or drink,

293
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,180
you'll be wasting

294
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,780
Douzi's love for you, Your Highness.

295
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,420
Eat something for Douzi.

296
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,900
Your Highness.

297
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,300
You must pull yourself together.

298
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,780
Your Highness.

299
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,500
Your Highness.

300
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,660
By the way, Your Highness.

301
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,820
This...

302
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,420
Her Majesty asked me

303
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,540
to deliver this to you.

304
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,580
Thieves have occupied the palace.

305
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,460
The ministers were dismissed
and their homes were raided.

306
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,780
I'm under house arrest, too.

307
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,380
Although the situation
in the palace is dire,

308
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,860
there are still a large number
of troops outside

309
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,460
to wait for your call.

310
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,300
I hope you take care of yourself

311
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,020
and wait for your chance.

312
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,980
Your Highness.

313
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,660
As long as you can survive,

314
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,780
there will be hope.

315
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,500
Visiting hour is up.

316
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,220
Come out now.

317
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,140
Your Highness,

318
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
for Jixi

319
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,060
and Douzi,

320
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,100
you must pull yourself together.

321
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,780
Hurry up.

322
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,980
I got this.

323
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,100
Here.

324
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,460
Okay.

325
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,260
A little bit to the left.

326
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,260
[Huacai Hall]

327
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,980
Let me help you.

328
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,700
Come on, hurry up.

329
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,100
[Yueying Pavilion]

330
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,300
Princess.

331
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,300
- Princess.
- Princess.

332
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,140
She was just like us a few days ago.

333
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,820
Now she's
the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

334
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,500
Stop it.

335
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,300
She was the Grand Chancellor's daughter
all along.

336
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,100
Douzi.

337
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,220
Douzi.

338
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,020
I know you're upset.

339
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,420
I heard

340
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,140
that you haven't eaten in two days.

341
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,300
No matter how sad you are,
you need to take care of yourself.

342
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,660
You left without saying a word.

343
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,300
Why do you pretend to care about me now?

344
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,380
You were in this with Xingshi,
weren't you?

345
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,820
If you didn't know,

346
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,860
why did you leave in a hurry?

347
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,380
I was not in it with Xingshi.

348
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,420
I had no idea what he was doing.

349
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,260
Xingshi never told you

350
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,420
that he was going to attack the palace?

351
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,900
Then why did you run away
in such a hurry?

352
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,700
If I had known,
I would have tried to dissuade him.

353
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,700
All he said was to save you.

354
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,620
Was I supposed to stop him?

355
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,380
I was as in the dark as you were.

356
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,220
I don't care
if it's in the dark or light.

357
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,820
I think you were
just won over by Xingshi,

358
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,660
that big liar.

359
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,300
He got you out early.

360
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,980
He must have planned it ahead.

361
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,060
If you didn't know,

362
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,700
why did you leave in such a hurry?

363
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,020
Or

364
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,380
were you just a coward

365
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,700
so you ran?

366
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,660
I really didn't know.

367
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,980
Forget it.

368
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,940
You're now
the Grand Chancellor's daughter again.

369
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,700
And Xingshi is there to protect you.

370
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,740
You can walk around in the palace

371
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,820
without any concern.

372
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,220
I just feel bad for my Little Master

373
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,380
who is so severely injured

374
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,460
and thrown into jail.

375
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,780
I know you're upset.

376
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,140
But there must be a way to save him.

377
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,860
I'll go beg Xingshi now.

378
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,620
Do you think he'll
let the Crown Prince go if you beg him?

379
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,820
Or

380
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,340
are you here today to show off

381
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,380
that your word
can save the Crown Prince now?

382
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,260
Is that

383
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,820
who I am to you?

384
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,620
I don't want to see
the Crown Prince get injured

385
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,500
or see you sad.

386
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,780
But you shouldn't have blamed me

387
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,260
for what Xingshi had done.

388
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,100
Wait.

389
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,020
Between you and me,

390
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,420
there's no need for explanation.

391
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,740
I understand what you're going through.

392
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,340
I won't be angry with you.

393
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,220
I just want to tell you

394
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
if anything happens to the Crown Prince,

395
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,540
Xingshi will be my enemy.

396
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,620
And then,

397
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,340
you'll be my enemy, too.

398
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,420
These days,

399
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,060
I've been worried about you

400
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,980
and considered everything for you.

401
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,660
But you've never tried to put yourself

402
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,900
in mine.

403
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,700
What are you all doing here?

404
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,660
- Princess wouldn't let us in.
- Princess wouldn't let us in.

405
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,260
You may leave.

406
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

407
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,940
Get out.

408
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,620
When are you going
to let my Little Master out?

409
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,740
It is good for you to be kind,

410
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,300
but being kind to the enemy

411
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,660
is not necessary.

412
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,500
Whoever hurts my Little Master
is my enemy.

413
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,620
He was injured so badly

414
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,060
trying to protect me.

415
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,380
And you put him in prison.

416
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,420
Let me out right now.

417
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,700
I'm going to see him.

418
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,460
All of Shengdong's subordinates agreed

419
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,900
that Nangong Yao should be executed.

420
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,980
And because he didn't harm you,

421
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,220
I spared his life.

422
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,580
If you are still stubborn,

423
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,180
I can't save him, either.

424
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,660
Who do they think they are?

425
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,300
Have my Little Master eaten their food

426
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,540
of drunk their water?

427
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,100
Who are they to kill him?

428
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,580
Princess, do not forget who you are.

429
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,500
Nangong Yao is our enemy's Crown Prince

430
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,460
who has an indelible hatred with you.

431
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,100
Do you think if I don't lock him up,

432
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,140
you two can stay together?

433
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,380
I suggest you give up that idea now.

434
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,140
Shut up.

435
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,260
Shengdong was destroyed
by his grandfather.

436
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,660
What does it have to do with him?

437
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,380
If you want,

438
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,460
you can dig out his grandfather
and fight him.

439
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,940
You think you've avenged your country.

440
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,900
But actually, deep down,

441
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,620
you are just a cold-blooded murderer.

442
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,940
What you're doing now

443
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,460
is no different
from his grandfather's doing.

444
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,540
I have my mission.

445
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,260
You do, too.

446
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,420
I have something for you.

447
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,660
Someone coming.

448
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,380
It's...

449
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,300
Your mother,

450
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,660
Empress Li.

451
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,140
When Empress Li died,

452
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,860
you were too little.

453
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,460
I think if you see this painting,

454
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,060
you should be able to recall something.

455
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,020
Maybe I should just act sadder.

456
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,140
But I was only a few months old.

457
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,500
I really don't remember anything.

458
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,860
You may leave.

459
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,740
If Nangong Yao's grandfather

460
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,780
hadn't murdered our people of Shengdong

461
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,340
and destroyed our country,

462
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,100
would you have suffered so much now?

463
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,460
You're not making any sense.

464
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,700
Shengdong was destroyed
by his grandfather.

465
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,540
What does it have to do
with my Little Master?

466
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,060
Must the hatred
of the last two generations

467
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,740
be put on us?

468
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,740
Or do you want me to dig out

469
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,460
his grandfather and kill him again?

470
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,500
I'm trying to tell you

471
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,820
that if you insist on being with him,

472
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,260
it will bring shame to Shengdong

473
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,780
and make Shengdong the laughingstock
in the world.

474
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,340
Do you think after we all die,

475
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,580
Emperor Dingning and Empress Li
will be relieved?

476
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,020
But I grew up in the Black Dog Alley.

477
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,580
I don't know my parents that well.

478
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,020
Besides,

479
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,020
Little Master didn't kill them.

480
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,340
If they want to laugh at us,
then let it be.

481
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,260
What happens after death
is even less important.

482
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,660
I'll have turned to dust.

483
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,300
What else are my parents
going to do to me?

484
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,020
Will they send me back alive
so I can take my revenge?

485
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,300
But now the destruction of Jixi
is settled.

486
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,540
Can you still be happy together?

487
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,020
Even if you can let go of the hatred,

488
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,300
Nangong Yao has lost his glory.

489
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,460
Will he be happy to be with you?

490
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,060
Will you be the same as before?

491
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,700
Can he forget about what happened?

492
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,660
If you already know the ending,

493
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,220
do you still want to be with him?

494
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,260
You have too many questions.

495
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,220
Why are you over-concerned?

496
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,300
You were giving me so many reasons.

497
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,700
Are you trying to confuse me?

498
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,820
I'm telling you, I'm not buying it.

499
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,020
Just tell me.

500
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,860
Are you going to free him or not?

501
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,500
If you're still stubborn,

502
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,940
I'll separate you two

503
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,500
and make sure you'll never meet again.

504
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,340
From now on, we share the happiness

505
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,540
and the pain.

506
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,900
I hate to see you like this.

507
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,660
Like you can put up with anything.

508
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,020
Aren't you
the distinguished Crown Prince?

509
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,820
Now your country is defeated.

510
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,420
Don't you feel humiliated?

511
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,060
I heard they used to be friends.

512
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,420
He hit harder than we did.

513
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,300
It's to show his loyalty
to his new master.

514
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,180
I've seen a lot of people like that.

515
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,300
All right. Stop looking.

516
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Where's your pride?

517
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,340
Where's your dignity?

518
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
Where did they go?

519
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,900
Your Highness,

520
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,660
I am pretending to submit to Xingshi.

521
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,460
I was wrong.

522
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,500
I am very sorry.

523
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,340
I know

524
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,740
nothing I say now can make it up to you.

525
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,580
All I ask

526
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,180
is for you to pull yourself together.

527
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,700
Your Highness.

528
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,780
as long as you survive,

529
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,260
Jixi

530
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,580
will still have hope.

531
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,420
But if you're dead,

532
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,140
the rumor of Douzi being evil
will be confirmed.

533
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,260
Now,

534
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,140
all the people of Jixi must hate her.

535
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,860
For the rest of her life,

536
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,940
she'll be criticized behind her back.

537
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,740
Why do you want to see our master, Miss?

538
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,060
Please let me report to him first.

539
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,580
- Miss.
- Miss.

540
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,380
-Miss.
- Miss, you are...

541
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,980
Step aside.

542
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
You may leave.

543
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

544
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,420
Why are you here today?

545
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,220
Now I have to ask before I see you.

546
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,580
You do have a different status.

547
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Let's sit down.

548
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,540
That's not necessary.

549
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,740
I'm here to ask about the Crown Prince.

550
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,940
You ordered to exile him?

551
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,540
I didn't kill him.

552
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,580
Exiling him is the greatest mercy
I could show him.

553
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,300
You say you'll keep him alive.

554
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,940
But everyone knows

555
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,060
that no one can survive that road.

556
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,380
Besides, he's injured right now.

557
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,740
It's no different from killing him.

558
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,540
Since you entered the palace,

559
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,020
I've come to see you every day.

560
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,340
Yet you just ignored me.

561
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,180
Now you've taken the initiative
to visit me,

562
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
but it is to plead for the Crown Prince.

563
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,140
I don't get it.

564
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,660
Now that Douzi is safe.

565
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,860
Why do you do this to the Crown Prince?

566
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,660
Do you think if I set him free,

567
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,220
he'll spare me?

568
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,100
You don't want him to die.

569
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,700
But do you want me to die?

570
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,060
For a prisoner now,

571
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,620
you treat me so indifferently.

572
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,340
Is there really no place for me

573
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,140
in your heart?

574
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,060
You told me

575
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,740
you were to get Douzi out.

576
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,260
But instead, you destroyed Jixi
and rebuilt Shengdong.

577
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,860
I don't understand why.

578
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,540
I was trying to save the Princess
that day.

579
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,940
But it was very complicated.

580
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,460
Anyway, this is what happened.

581
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,300
I'll just have to go with the fate.

582
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,660
I know you feel sad.

583
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,460
But there is a silver lining.

584
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,260
At least we can now

585
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,740
be together in broad daylight.

586
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,260
We don't have to hide

587
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,420
like before.

588
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,580
I'd rather be like before.

589
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,740
What do you want me to do then?

590
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,780
To give it all back to the Crown Prince

591
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,140
and drag all the soldiers with me

592
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,740
to prison, only to end up
getting beheaded in public?

593
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,620
I thought you could understand me.

594
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,460
But you are just like everyone else.

595
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,460
I did everything

596
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,420
for my own country.

597
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,540
What's wrong with that?

598
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,260
You only care about your own country.

599
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,940
What about mine?

600
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,380
Princess,

601
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,860
this was sent by Miss Mei.

602
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,860
The Crown Prince will be exiled
in three days.

603
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,860
Mei.

604
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,350
[The Prison]

605
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,580
Princess, what are you...

606
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,420
Let's go.

607
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,220
Hurry, hurry.

608
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,020
Come on.

609
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,740
Someone's coming.

610
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,660
Who...

611
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,780
Nanbei.

612
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,500
Let's go.

613
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,460
Hurry.

614
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,140
Your Highness.

615
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,420
Little Master.

616
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,260
People out there waiting for you

617
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,580
have all been taken down.

618
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,660
Princess,

619
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,540
what are you doing back here?

620
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,740
Take the Princess away.

621
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,220
Don't come closer.

622
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,700
You

623
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,500
bad people.

624
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,180
You evil people.

625
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,700
Xingshi, just kill us if you want.

626
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,900
What else is there to say?

627
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,100
Don't think I won't kill you.

628
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,100
I've arranged all this.

629
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,380
If you want to kill someone,
just kill me.

630
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,620
If you want to exile him,

631
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,660
exile me with him.

632
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,540
Do you think this is a game?

633
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,380
In a cold and remote place like that,

634
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,260
you can't even survive for three days.

635
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,060
I... I just need to gain more weight.

636
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,180
I... I'll eat roots and bark.

637
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,700
I'll even steal ants' food.

638
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,100
I don't need you to worry about me.

639
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,260
Are you really going to
commit adultery for him?

640
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,220
I'm already the Crown Princess anyway.

641
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,180
If you want to destroy him,

642
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,620
you can take me down as well.

643
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,780
Don't threaten me.

644
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,900
If you go against the destiny,

645
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,700
I will put him to death
by dismembering his body.

646
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,700
Take the Princess away.

647
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:39,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

648
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,740
