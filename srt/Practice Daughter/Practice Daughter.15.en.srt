Yeah.

Lives are at stake.

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,380
Let's figure it out together.

73
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,660
Are you sure they are your fathers?

74
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,380
Yeah, I'm sure.

75
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,540
I've seen that drawing many times.

76
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,300
That's the secret code
between my fathers and me.

77
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,780
Why didn't you
just tell the Crown Prince?

78
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,900
I...

79
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,740
I didn't want the Crown Prince
to know that as a thief,

80
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,700
I also had three thieving fathers.

81
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,500
If they truly did something bad,

82
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,180
telling His Highness the truth

83
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,460
would put him in a dilemma.

84
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,700
If he helps them,

85
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,300
that will be bending the law.

86
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,940

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,540
you will...

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,380
They would never steal refugees' money.

89

We swore on our lives

90
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,420
to never steal money from the poor.

91
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,700
If we steal from the poor,

92
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,820

00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,980
Okay, I believe you.

95
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,260
How do you plan to save them?

Miss Mei.

112
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Mei Yushan.

113
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,740
We couldn't wake her up.

114
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,580
Could it be she passed out?

115
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,500
As a pampered lady,

116
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,500
she has never suffered such humiliation.

117
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,900
I really feel bad for her.

118
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,780
Thank you, ladies, for your concern.

119
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,100
My lady is fine.

120
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,100
His Highness brought
good wine and food earlier

121
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,420
to visit my lady.

122
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,940
She had a bit too much to eat.

123
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,860
Now, she is sleeping.

124
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,940
Impossible.

125
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,540
How could she get such treatment
when being grounded?

126
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,780
You're making it up.

127
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,700
His Highness couldn't have come here.

128
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,100
You are just talking nonsense.

129
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,940
The food is still on the table.

130
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,460
Come in and you'll see.

131
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,980
Let's have a check.

132
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,140
There really are so many dishes.

133
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,780
So sumptuous.

134
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,780
There are also gifts.

135
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,700
Gifts?

136
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,780
What gifts?

137
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,020
Here they are.

138
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,100
Where?

139
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,780
Where are the gifts?

140
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,620
I found out who that maid is.

141
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,620
She's not even from the Mei Family.

142
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,260
No one in the residence knows about her.

143
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,820
She doesn't have
a registered identity, either.

144
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,540
She grew up in the capital

145
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,700
living off petty theft.

146
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,860
It seems

147
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,540
Douzi brought her
into the palace privately.

148
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,620
Then...

149
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,300
What do we do next?

150
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,860
This will be tricky.

151
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,100
Douzi risked her life to save her.

152
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,020
They seem to be quite close.

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,220
If Mei is who I think she is,

154
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,180
no matter if Douzi knows about it,

155
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,820
she can't get away with it.

156
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,780
We missed a great opportunity today.

157
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,380
The maid

158
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,460
should have been killed today.

159
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,100
Please don't blame yourself.

160
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,980
You were trying to save Miss Mei.

161
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,340
Unfortunately, the Crown Prince came.

162
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,940
His Highness may not know

163
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,660
who he saved

164
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,660
is most likely

165
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,260
a hibernating viper.

166
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,820
Are you sure making a scene

167
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,140
can distract the soldiers
and get us out of the palace?

168
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,460
There is no other way.

169
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,580
We have to take a chance.

170
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,260
So should you go or I go?

171
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,420
I'll go.

172
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,740
If I get caught,

173
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,180
you can find other ways.

174
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
That's a bad idea.

175
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,460
If you get caught,

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,060
I still have to save you.

177
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,580
Forget about me.

178
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,860
They'll just lock me up

179
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,780
for further instruction.

180
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,140
Can't we come up with a better idea?

181
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,060
Why are you so hesitant today?

182
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,860
Didn't you always teach me

183
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,380
to think things through
and not to act impulsively?

184
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,700
Why is it the other way around today?

185
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
We don't have much time.

186
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,460
We must save your three fathers.

187
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,580
My dear sister,

188
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,740
you have to be careful.

189
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,660
The same to you.

190
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,340
Let them through.

191
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,460
That is the carriage
of the Eastern Palace.

192
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,700
I just had an idea.

193
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,820
[The Stable]

194
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,340
I'll get in this one.

195
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,150
Tomorrow, the Crown Prince

196
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,660
will leave the palace
in one of the litters.

197
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,980
Whoever gets
to the execution ground first

198
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,860
should save your fathers at once.

199
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,700
I thank you on behalf of them.

200
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,660
Who is it? So annoying.

201
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,300
Who is it?

202
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,740
Who's it?

203
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,860
The criminals have pleaded guilty

204
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,700
and will be decapitated.

205
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,060
Wait.

206
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,900
- It can't be a capital crime.
- Get up!

207
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,980
Come back.

208
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,100
You're to be decapitated.

209
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,180
It can't be a capital crime.

210
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,900
I'm not married yet.

211
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't be afraid.

212
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,500
Take them away.

213
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,100
Fathers.

214
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,420
First Father.

215
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,780
Why are you here?

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,060
So I am in your carriage.

217
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,220
Are we going to the Government Office?

218
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,580
It's early in the morning. Why would I
go to the Government Office now?

219
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,940
No?

220
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,380
So... There will be
no decapitation today?

221
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,460
The execution is at Wu hour.

222
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,060
You...

223
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,540
If you are still going to behead them,

224
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,860
then why don't we set off early?

225
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,940
Let's go now,
in case they advance the execution.

226
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,420
What's wrong with you today?

227
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,580
So eager to see the decapitation?

228
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,300
I can't explain it clearly
in a few words.

229
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,860
But let's go
to the Government Office now.

230
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,140
Please hurry up.

231
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,060
Let's hurry to the Government Office.

232
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,500
Hurry up.

233
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,180
It's just a decapitation.
Why such a hurry?

234
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,180
If you want to see it,

235
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,500
I'll show you more of it
when I finish my work.

236
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,660
Just a decapitation?

237
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,700
What could be more important
than a decapitation?

238
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,380
Let's go there now.

239
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,860
Okay, okay.

240
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,380
Go to the Government Office.

241
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,490
[The Stable]

242
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,020
Guard Xingshi.

243
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,900
Mei?

244
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,940
Guard Xingshi,

245
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,660
can you take me out of the palace
to the Government Office?

246
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,500
What happened?

247
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,300
Please don't ask.

248
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,660
Just take me to the Government Office.

249
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,580
Lingxiao.

250
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,420
Lingxiao.

251
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,100
Mr. Bai.

252
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,300
What's wrong?

253
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,100
Let's go to the execution ground now.

254
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,140
The execution ground?

255
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,540
Mr. Bai, did you foresee something?

256
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,740
The Crown Prince is in danger.

257
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,340
Let's go.

258
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,140
Stop, stop. Your Highness.

259
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,860
They advanced the execution.

260
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,260
Yeah.

261
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,780
They stole food from me. I'm so poor.

262
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,100
I have kids to raise at home.

263
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,620
Yeah, they stole from us.

264
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,700
Oh no.

265
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,500
How could they do this to me?

266
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,780
- Just cut their heads.
- Just cut their heads.

267
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Decapitate them.

268
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,140
Sir, please.

269
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,300
It is Chen hour.

270
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,260
Decapitate them now.

271
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,860
You can't decapitate them.

272
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,260
You're not allowed to get in.

273
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,540
What is she doing?

274
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,780
What was that?

275
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,740
Don't cut our heads.

276
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,140
- Don't cut our heads.
- Decapitate them now.

277
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,460
Dan.

278
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,980
Dan!

279
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,860
Cut his head.

280
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,780
They're wronged, Sir.

281
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,300
Douzi?

282
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,900
She's so bold.

283
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,780
- Who's that?
- Do you know who she is?

284
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,020
They're wronged.

285
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,300
Let go of him.

286
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,780
Stop it.

287
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,740
Who are you?

288
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,980
It doesn't matter who I am.

289
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,020
There is a rule

290
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,790
that you must reopen the case

291
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,100
if anyone cries he is wronged
by the guillotine.

292
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,340
Dan, don't be afraid.

293
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,340
Arrest her.

294
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:04,860
Yes.

295
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,340
Let her go.

296
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,260
What happened?

297
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,860
You...

298
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,980
All of you, back up.

299
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,940
Who is this person now?

300
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,780
Who is he?

301
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,660
Who is he?

302
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,820
Get away.

303
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,140
Come on.

304
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,460
You can say whatever you want, okay?

305
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,180
Don't be afraid.

306
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,060
I'm here.

307
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,100
Boss,

308
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,980
isn't this the officer who framed us?

309
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,020
Bring the witness up.

310
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,660
Who are you?

311
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,260
Who is this person?

312
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,100
I don't know.

313
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,740
Look.

314
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,260
The officer even made room for him.

315
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,380
Ding Ermao,

316
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,140
take a look at these three.

317
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,860
Are they who stole your money?

318
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,340
I don't need to take a look.
It's definitely them.

319
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,620
I can recognize them no matter what.

320
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,620
Nonsense.

321
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,540
- What proof do you have?
- You are lying.

322
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,660
Don't venomously slander them.

323
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,740
You are lying.

324
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,940
Yeah, what else can you say?

325
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,460
Sir, please seek justice for me.

326
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,220
You are lying.

327
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,540
Sir, please seek justice for me.

328
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,020
You are lying.

329
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,940
I found my money in their package.

330
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940
Who else could it be?

331
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,900
Did you see them steal it?

332
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,660
- Did you?
- Did you?

333
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,780
I didn't.

334
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,740
We all fell asleep
when we got back from work that day.

335
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,180
Then they sneaked out and got caught

336
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,500
with my money in their package.

337
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,460
You went out and came back together.

338
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,620
They didn't have time to steal.

339
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,860
- Yeah.
- That's right.

340
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,940
Miss,

341
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,340
am I the one
who's hearing the case or...

342
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,780
Be careful.

343
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,660
Here.

344
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,150
[Execution Hall]

345
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,180
Excuse me.

346
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,780
Excuse me.

347
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,020
Excuse me.

348
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,900
I don't know how to explain this to you.

349
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,460
But the three of them

350
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,340
would never steal refugees' money.

351
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,860
- Right.
- Right.

352
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,220
And they're supposed
to be executed at Wu hour.

353
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,380
Why do you do it now?

354
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,740
Why is
the Grand Chancellor's daughter here?

355
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,980
We want to see them beheaded.

356
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,860
Kill them.

357
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,660
She's talking nonsense.

358
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,140
Yeah, why?

359
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,780
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

360
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,380
Wait,

361
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,260
did... Did someone pay for you to do it?

362
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,700
Your Highness,
I did not mean to offend you.

363
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,220
Then let them go now.

364
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:30,900
Hurry up.

365
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,340
- Let us go now.
- Let us go now.

366
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,380
These three are the prime suspects.

367
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,380
Please seek justice for us, Sir.

368
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,020
They look like bad people.

369
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,820
Punish them heavily, Sir.

370
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,020
Don't let them fool you, Sir.

371
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,700
[Fairness and Justice]
Do not be deceived, Sir.

372
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,900
Hold off on the execution today.

373
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,260
Wait, it's only held off?

374
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,700
So they won't be decapitated?

375
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,740
So we got up so early for nothing?

376
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,620
Exactly.

377
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,740
How about our life-saving money?
Would we be paid with nothing?

378
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,100
Right?

379
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,340
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,420
- Cut their heads.
- Cut their heads.

381
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,820
We want to see them decapitated.

382
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,260
- Yes.
- Decapitate them.

383
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,500
- Kill them.
- Kill them.

384
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,300
- Kill them.
- We want to see them decapitated.

385
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,340
Why don't you do it?

386
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,220
I got up so early for nothing.

387
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,940
Cut their heads off.

388
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,420
Kill them. Decapitate them.

389
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,620
Cut their heads.

390
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,460
- Hurry.
- Kill them.

391
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,020
Who will take responsibility
for our losses?

392
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,740
Miss Mei,

393
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,820
now that your three fathers are safe.

394
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,140
Let me walk you back to the carriage.

395
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,140
It's not very safe here.

396
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,340
How do you know

397
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,620
they're Douzi's fathers?

398
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,100
Aren't they your fathers?

399
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,540
They're animals.

400
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,500
Execute them now.

401
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,340
Let me walk you back to the carriage.

402
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,460
Execute them, Sir.

403
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,060
You have to seek justice for us, Sir.

404
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,140
- Kill them.
- Kill them.

405
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,060
Step back.

406
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,700
No more pushing.

407
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,780
Everybody, listen to me.

408
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,700
Please listen to me.

409
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,900
Don't push.

410
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,300
Listen to me, everybody.

411
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,260
Be quiet.

412
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,740
- Kill them.
- Kill them.

413
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,540
- They are good people.
- Quiet.

414
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,380
Please stay back.

415
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,740
Be quiet and stay back.

416
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,460
Give us an explanation.

417
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,180
Calm down.

418
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,740
Step back.

419
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,260
Back off.

420
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,140
Quiet.

421
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,260
You can't just release them.

422
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,300
No more pushing.

423
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,140
You can't just release them.

424
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,700
What sound is it?

425
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,500
Who is she?

426
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,340
Looks scary.

427
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,300
Misfortune befalls.

428
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,020
Prophecies come true.

429
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,660
Misfortune befalls.

430
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,140
Prophecies come true.

431
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,940
Misfortune befalls.

432
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,180
Prophecies come true.

433
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,700
Misfortune befalls.

434
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,660
The Crown Prince

435
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,220
carries bad luck.

436
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,460
It was predicted more than a decade ago

437
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,740
that he would fall in love
with Shengdong's Princess

438
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,980
and destroy Jixi.

439
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,420
The earthquake occurred because of him.

440
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,140
The earthquake is a sign.

441
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,140
If he ascends the throne,

442
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,300
Jixi will be destroyed.

443
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,620
Stop it. Back off.

444
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,980
- Back off. Guard His Highness.
- You old woman...

445
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,980
- Guards.
- You'll lose your tongue for lying.

446
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,940
Bad luck.

447
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,980
Who are you? Kneel!

448
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,900
Bad luck.

449
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,180
Bad luck. Stop talking.

450
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,100
Exactly.

451
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
They're in it together.

452
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,540
Misfortune befalls...

453
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,740
So shameless.

454
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,660
Prophecies come true.

455
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,420
He will bring bad luck to all of us.

456
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,300
Your acting is

457
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,100
not as good as Sorcerer Wang
from the Black Dog Alley.

458
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,340
How much did they pay you?

459
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,020
Also,

460
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,260
was there an extra charge
for what is in your hands?

461
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,460
Tell me the truth.

462
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,100
Why are you deliberately
mystifying people here?

463
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,100
Bad luck

464
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,340
destroys the country.

465
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,860
The earthquake is

466
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,700
just a sign.

467
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,220
There is already a sign.

468
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,580
It's all because of you.

469
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,700
It's all because of you.

470
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
Guard His Highness.

471
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,220
It's all because of you.

472
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,940
Step back.

473
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,380
Don't let him go.

474
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,140
Step back.

475
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,100
Let's go.

476
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,740
Douzi.

477
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,620
Watch out.

478
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,180
Don't let him go.

479
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,500
Mei.

480
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,380
No.

481
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,900
You can't leave today.

482
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,820
Mei.

483
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,620
Are you okay?

484
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,900
Enough talking. Arrest them all.

485
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,500
Yeah.

486
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,340
We can't let them go.

487
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,820
We can't let any of them go.

488
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't let them go.

489
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Douzi.

490
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,580
You can't go.

491
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,500
It's too dangerous over there.

492
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,300
Bad luck.

493
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,100
You're bad luck.

494
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
- Enough talking.
- Don't push.

495
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,260
Stay back.

496
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,660
Bad luck.

497
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,300
- Give us an explanation.
- Bad luck.

498
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,980
Quiet.

499
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,620
Stop it, everybody.

500
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,500
Go away.

501
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,580
Your Highness.

502
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,940
This... This is treason.

503
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,380
Your Highness.

504
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,420
Miss Mei.

505
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,900
Douzi.

506
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,620
This man took poison.

507
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,300
Nanbei.

508
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,460
Coming.

509
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,380
Evacuate the civilians.

510
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
Be safe.

511
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,740
Okay.

512
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,340
Step aside.

513
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,740
Protect... Protect His Highness.

514
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,260
You may leave now.

515
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Leave.

516
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,660
Leave.

517
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,340
Mr. Bai.

518
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,020
Leave. Everybody.

519
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,700
Leave.

520
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,260
Stop.

521
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,580
How are you feeling?

522
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,660
Don't listen to that old woman.

523
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
If a prophecy could decide one's fate,

524
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,740
everyone out there could be the emperor.

525
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,660
Silly girl.

526
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,620
Don't do this kind of thing again.

527
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,500
At any time,

528
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,020
let me protect you.

529
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,380
You are the Crown Prince.

530
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,020
Your life is worth a lot
more than mine, a thief's life.

531
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,460
I don't think
my life is worth more than yours.

532
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,660
- I...
- Compared to your status,

533
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
I care more about you.

534
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,820
So my Little Master

535
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,220
never look down upon me
for being a thief.

536
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,940
What?

537
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,580
Still want me to hold you?

538
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,500
My back hurts.

539
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,620
I can't lie down.

540
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,820
Then sit here.

541
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
My bottom hurts, so I can't sit either.

542
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
Then I'll hold you like this.

543
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,300
Still hurt?

544
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,660
Not anymore.

545
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,340
Your Highness,

546
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
I, Shen Yu,

547
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,060
failed to protect you today.

548
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,140
Please punish me.

549
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,740
I am fine.

550
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,860
Get up.

551
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,460
Your Highness, please punish me.

552
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,980
It was Miss Mei who was injured today.

553
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,420
If you're to be punished,

554
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,220
you should ask her
how she wants to punish you.

555
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,540
I'm sorry for offending you.

556
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,860
Please punish me, Miss Mei.

557
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,300
It's fine.

558
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,780
Thank you for protecting His Highness
with your life.

559
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,580
Otherwise, I would be very regretful.

560
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,220
I am willing to accept any punishment.

561
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Miss Mei, please.

562
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,420
Well, get up.

563
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,740
Thank you.

564
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,780
Where are my three fathers?

565
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,940
- Three fathers?
- Three fathers?

566
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,020
Uhh...

567
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,340
The three people
who almost got decapitated today

568
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,900
are my adoptive fathers.

569
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,460
Your Highness, I'll be on my way.

570
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,060
It's...

571
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,900
This way, please.

572
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,220
Big Head Yu.

573
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,300
Que Kuai'er.

574
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
Xia Xiaodan.

575
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,140
What?

576
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,340
Are you pretending you don't know me?

577
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,300
Bad Douzi.

578
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,060
I thought I would never

579
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,980
see you again.

580
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,980
My girl.

581
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,660
We've suffered a lot these days.

582
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,580
Stop it.

583
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,340
If First Father hadn't drawn that sign,

584
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,940
we wouldn't have had a chance

585
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,500
to talk face to face.

586
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,020
Enough.

587
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,140
We have done nothing wrong.

588
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,580
And we have great fortune.

589
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,340
This one here.

590
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,980
When I looked at him, he told me...

591
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,980
He told me he was from the palace.

592
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,500
So I drew the sign in a hurry.

593
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,420
I thought maybe you could see it.

594
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,380
I'm glad you have a conscience.

595
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,500
We didn't raise you for nothing.

596
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,460
So

597
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,220
it was because you mistakenly thought
you could see me in the palace,

598
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,500
you went to work.

599
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Of course.

600
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,620
Now you know we were wronged.

601
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,380
Your...

602
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,580
I was also present that day.

603
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,860
It's true that no refugees
wanted to sign the contract.

604
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,380
It was the three of them
who took the lead

605
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,700
and solved the hiring problem.

606
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,740
You see?

607
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,020
In this case,

608
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,020
you just need to give back the pensions,

609
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,820
and then you're free to go.

610
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,020
What?

611
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,660
We have suffered so much.

612
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,780
That's it?

613
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,100
That's it?

614
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,540
Stop it.

615
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,580
Serve the food now.

616
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
What's wrong with this kid?

617
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,940
What is all this?

618
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,220
I don't know any of them.

619
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,340
Are you trying
to compensate us with just these?

620
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,340
Yeah.

621
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,660
Even... Even though you are just

622
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,220
two small officers.

623
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,020
You need to be sincere
when you apologize.

624
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,260
Get us braised fish

625
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,420
and roast chicken.

626
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,300
The roast chicken needs
to be the size of my fist.

627
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,100
Right.

628
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,220
And also crispy duck and sauced beef.

629
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,580
Also shrimps.

630
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,100
And pork legs.

631
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,780
Wine.

632
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,500
Two bottles.

633
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,420
The outdated ones can do.

634
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,300
Three bottles.

635
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,460
Four bottles.

636
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,220
Get the food ready, as requested.

637
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,780
Hurry up.

638
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,340
- Go.
- Yes.

639
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
I will get on it.

640
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,060
I indeed almost wronged
your three fathers.

641
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,820
But you don't have to
get back at me like this.

642
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,460
Let's eat.

643
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,940
Tasty.

644
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,820
So nice.

645
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,660
Uhh... Kid.

646
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,700
May I ask you something?

647
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,740
Why is... Why is that officer

648
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,260
so afraid of you?

649
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,980
Dan,

650
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,140
do you think that officer

651
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,220
is somewhat like

652
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,100
our deputy village chief?

653
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,940
Yes.

654
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,220
For real.

655
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,260
Village chief.

656
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:22,980
He's...

657
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,660
Village chief.

658
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
He's the village chief.

659
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,380
It doesn't matter who he is.

660
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,220
He is just a young boy.

661
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,300
He can't be the Crown Prince anyway.

662
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,100
Impossible.

663
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,820
If he were the Crown Prince,

664
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,460
I would be the Jade Emperor.

665
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,220
The Crown Prince.

666
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,100
Are you afraid of losing your life

667
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,460
and never being able to drink or eat

668
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,900
anything so good?

669
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,260
Am I afraid

670
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,940
of losing my life

671
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,780
and never being able to
drink any wine like this?

672
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,220
Am I afraid

673
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,500
of never being able to eat

674
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,500
any meat like this?

675
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,020
Do you think we're afraid?

676
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,300
Do you?

677
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,260
Pour some wine for Boss.

678
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,420
You...

679
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,980
It's fine.

680
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,020
- He should do it.
- It's...

681
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,940
Young boy, you are good.

682
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,820
You know what to do.

683
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,700
What young boy?

684
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,900
I'm telling you, girl.

685
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
He's a good boy, you know?

686
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,940
My girl must be generous.

687
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,700
You know?

688
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,620
If you ever become the Crown Princess,

689
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,940
don't forget about him.

690
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,700
He did us a favor.

691
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
You should

692
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,140
get him promoted when you can.

693
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,900
- Help him.
- Exactly.

694
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,580
What? Stop talking nonsense.

695
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,660
What Crown Princess?

696
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,660
He... He's the Crown Prince.

697
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,700
Crown...

698
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,420
Crown...

699
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,140
Prince.

700
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,020
Who? Who do you mean?

701
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,940
The Crown Prince.

702
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,460
What?

703
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:20,980
The Crown...

704
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,260
Prince.

705
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,220
I... I... I, well...

706
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,220
Your Highness, well...

707
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,140
Douzi, is he really the Crown Prince?

708
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,620
Yes.

709
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,660
The Crown Prince.

710
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,700
He is the Crown Prince. So what?

711
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,820
The Crown Prince
can't treat us unjustly, can he?

712
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,380
Right?

713
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,820
You...

714
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,900
Get up, both of you.

715
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,660
I can't get up.

716
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,540
Whoever gets up is the loser.

717
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,020
Please get up.

718
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,420
Haven't you had enough kneeling today?

719
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,980
Come on.

720
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,140
Get up.

721
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,020
Oh no.

722
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,340
- Please.
- Please sit down.

723
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,220
Okay.

724
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,420
Let's eat.

725
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,580
Try this.

726
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,780
This one is also good.

727
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,940
Which dish does the Crown Princess like?

728
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,180
I can get it for you.

729
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,660
Que,

730
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,860
If Douzi really becomes
the Crown Princess,

731
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,500
we'll be
the Crown Prince's father-in-law.

732
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,300
Are we going to be powerful officials?

733
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,460
I...

734
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,380
We can at least be a mayor.
Don't you think?

735
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,460
Look how petty your wishes are.

736
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,580
As someone who travels the world,

737
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,940
we won't put ourselves
under the patronage of a higher-up.

738
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,900
If we are not the same people,

739
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,860
we won't be on the same side.

740
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,660
Right, right.

741
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,260
By the way,

742
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,580
Douzi,

743
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,860
why are you named Douzi?

744
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,660
Don't tell him.

745
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,340
I... I know.

746
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,620
Well... It's a long story.

747
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,980
When we first

748
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,660
found Douzi and brought her home,

749
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,940
she wouldn't drink milk

750
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,980
and kept crying because of the hunger.

751
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,220
I had no choice

752
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,020
but to flirt with Mrs. Wang next door

753
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,300
to get some soy milk.

754
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,140
I tried so hard to bring her up.

755
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,540
I really tried so hard to bring her up.

756
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,780
- I tried so hard...
- We got her soybeans

757
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,380
and soy milk.

758
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,020
We got her soybeans and soy milk
to bring her up.

759
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,060
After she grew up,

760
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,020
she kept soybeans
in her pocket every day.

761
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,220
After eating those,

762
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,020
she... She...

763
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,220
she farted everywhere she went.

764
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,380
Big Head Yu.

765
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,940
Eat the meat.

766
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,940
But honestly,

767
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,940
Douzi and I are the closest.

768
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,580
If I hadn't

769
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,340
taken her out of the box,

770
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,100
she would have starved to death.

771
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,300
- It was me who took her out.
- It was me who took her out.

772
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,940
Stop. Think about it.

773
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,020
It was me who took her out.

774
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,220
- It was me who took her out.
- It was me who took her out.

775
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,380
- It was me who took her out.
- It was me who took her out.

776
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,300
- It was me who took her out.
- It was me who took her out.

777
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,900
- It was me who took her out.
- You have no shame.

778
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,300
Who are you talking about?

779
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,980
You have no shame.

780
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,420
- You have no shame.
- Enough.

781
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
- I took her out of that box.
- It was me.

782
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,700
- I told you It was me...
- Well...

783
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,540
Here.

784
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,620
Try this.

785
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,620
It's hibiscus.

786
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,940
I got her out of the box.

787
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,740
You got it wrong.

788
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,460
There was chaos at the execution ground.

789
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,100
I wonder how Mei Daidai is now.

790
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,260
Think about it.

791
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,940
I'm fine.

792
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,860
This might hurt a little.

793
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,940
Please bear with it.

794
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:03,940
Does it hurt?

795
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,580
No.

796
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,140
Earlier at the Government Office,

797
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,980
thank you for saving me, Guard Xingshi.

798
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,500
Never mind.

799
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,660
That's what I should do.

800
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,100
If he only saved me once,
that might be nothing.

801
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,220
But what's the reason for him

802
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,420
to repeatedly save me?

803
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,540
I've always wanted to ask you
about something, Guard Xingshi.

804
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,420
Just call me Xingshi.

805
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,260
That night when I was ill
in bed with a cold,

806
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,180
I somehow felt like I had a visitor.

807
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,860
I bear you no ill will.

808
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,980
If I disturbed you somehow...

809
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,540
No.

810
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,540
That's not what I mean.

811
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,380
