you begged the Empress to allow you
to marry the Crown Princess.

- Tell us.
- Come on.

67

As the Crown Princess,

68
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,220

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,100
All right.

184
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,940
I know

185
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,740
I made a pretty good dish.

186
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,980
You three have been with me the longest.

187
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,540
So try it together.

188
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

189
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,060
Go ahead.

190
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,060
I have served Your Highness
my whole life.

191
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,620
It's worth it.

192
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,700
How's it?

193
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,820
Salt...

194
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,540
Not enough?

195
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,460
It's not enough?

196
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,100
Try it.

197
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,020
- Too much salt.
- Too much salt

198
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,660
Too much?

199
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,380
Come on.

200
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,100
The other side.

201
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,500
What?

202
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,580
Let me see.

203
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,860
Will this be cooled down
a little bit slower?

204
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,300
Go away.

205
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,820
Ladies. Please leave.

206
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,100
Please go back. Don't stay here.

207
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,380
Ladies, please leave.

208
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,060
Please leave.

209
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,580
Your Highness.

210
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,500
Go Greet His Highness.

211
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,300
How was your sleep last night?

212
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,980
Were you mad at me yesterday?

213
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,380
You must have missed breakfast.

214
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,700
Here.

215
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,820
His Highness got up
in the middle of the night

216
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,340
and made this mutton soup himself.

217
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,260
This...

218
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,020
I made this myself this morning.

219
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,340
Here. Try the soup first.

220
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,780
Don't do it again.

221
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,420
You don't like it?

222
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,940
Then I'll make something else.

223
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,700
No need.

224
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,780
You are the Crown Prince.

225
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,020
Don't you have other things to do?

226
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,860
Mei,

227
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,860
let's go.

228
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,860
Douzi.

229
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,380
Sorry,

230
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,860
I've failed you.

231
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,260
It's...

232
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,780
Stop it.

233
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,580
Why did you have to give him
the cold shoulder?

234
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,900
I don't like him.

235
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,060
You know it.

236
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,420
Your Highness.

237
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,140
Your Highness, don't be angry.

238
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,700
Your Highness, anger hurts health.

239
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,940
No, no.

240
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,380
Your Highness, not this one.

241
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,260
Please don't destroy this one.

242
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,260
Your Highness.

243
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Please don't.

244
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,900
Don't be mad.

245
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,260
You can ruin everything

246
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,500
but don't get so angry.

247
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Don't be so angry.

248
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,660
Yao, calm down.

249
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,780
When there's a conflict,

250
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,660
the one who gets angry loses.

251
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,580
I'm angry?

252
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,060
Do I look angry?

253
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,180
No!

254
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,980
Your Highness.

255
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,420
- Hit me instead...
- Yao.

256
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,780
Hit me

257
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,540
for fun.

258
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,980
Hit me for fun.

259
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,700
Dongxi,

260
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,020
come and practice archery with me.

261
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
- Okay.
- That's right.

262
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,580
Do something that interests you

263
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,700
to distract yourself.

264
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,660
Get your mind off the troubles.

265
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,020
Remember this!

266
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,900
It is said nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

267
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,460
But forcing it gets us what we want.

268
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,380
I can't stand by
and watch the prophecy come true.

269
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,420
But what can I do

270
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,900
to dash the prophecy

271
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,020
without harming you?

272
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,180
The Crown Prince has fallen in love
with the Princess of Shengdong.

273
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,060
Now even if I kill Mei Yushan,

274
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300
it won't change anything.

275
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,020
But...

276
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,460
Why would Douzi
lead Jixi to its destruction?

277
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,420
Why would she
put the Crown Prince in jail?

278
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Why did I only see the end

279
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,540
but not the beginning?

280
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,540
Why?

281
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,540
Why?

282
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,340
What am I supposed to do?

283
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,780
Although it is a crisis,

284
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,380
there is still a chance.

285
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,660
If Douzi knows

286
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,060
her relationship with the Crown Prince
is a disaster,

287
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,580
and is willing to leave the palace
and the Crown Prince,

288
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,740
the prophecy

289
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,220
will be broken.

290
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,460
Let's go and check it out.

291
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,340
Let's check it out.

292
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,180
What's going on?

293
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,220
Come here.

294
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,700
It's like you are
a totally different person these days.

295
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,940
Why?

296
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,580
If you're unhappy in the palace,

297
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,500
just tell me.

298
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
I'll go outside with you.

299
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,900
No need.

300
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,420
What are they saying?

301
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,660
Don't be impulsive.

302
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,340
- Calm down.
- Don't be impulsive.

303
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,940
Is there anything you want to tell me?

304
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,940
No.

305
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
It's obvious.

306
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,220
It's...

307
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,900
Do you think these two...

308
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,060
Yao could have chosen anyone,

309
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,260
but he chose her.

310
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,260
Yao, you need to take it easy.

311
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,380
If you go after her, you'll lose.

312
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,140
Yeah, Yao.

313
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,180
Stay calm.

314
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,380
Just give her some time.

315
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,220
Let her think about it.

316
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,860
Right.

317
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,140
Don't rush.

318
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,020
Stay calm.

319
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,020
Miss Mei,

320
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,620
Mr. Bai asked me to give you this.

321
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,860
How's everything going?

322
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,580
All the spies and itineraries
are in place.

323
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,580
The only problem
is the gate of the outer city.

324
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,060
We managed to buy off the guard.

325
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,060
But they suddenly changed a new guard.

326
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,900
I'll get someone to meet

327
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Su Ruomei's father, Su Shenhai.

328
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,500
If he would like to help us,

329
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,180
this is going to work.

330
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,620
But I worry

331
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,980
if we do send them out of the palace,

332
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,180
the Mei Family and the court
will get to the bottom of it.

333
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,220
They cannot stay
in the palace any longer.

334
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,140
What do we do
when His Highness is like this?

335
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,140
No idea.

336
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,900
It's raining.

337
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,660
Your Highness, it's raining.

338
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,580
Let's head back.

339
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,780
Your Highness, the rain is too heavy.
Let's go back.

340
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,620
Get out of my way.

341
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
Douzi.

342
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,900
- We're going to the Mid-Autumn Dinner.
- Great.

343
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,100
I'm so happy.

344
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,220
Exactly.

345
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,020
- I've got an invitation...
- Your name's on it. So what...

346
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,420
- So beautiful.
- My name's on it, too.

347
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,700
On the Mid-Autumn Festival Dinner,

348
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,540
His Highness will show up, too.

349
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,300
Maybe I'll be the Crown Princess.

350
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,580
- You're talking nonsense...
- We sincerely...

351
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,740
- His Highness is mine.
- invite Miss Zhuang Yanyang

352
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,220
to the dinner.

353
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,500
This is the invitation for your lady.

354
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
It's...

355
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,580
Her Majesty invites all the ladies

356
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,500
to the Mid-Autumn Festival Dinner
tomorrow night.

357
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,380
Please come.

358
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,260
Look at that.

359
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,540
Douzi, there's something
I need to tell you in person.

360
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,340
It is very important.

361
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,420
Please come to the Tianji Mansion.

362
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,140
Please don't be afraid.

363
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,740
I would never hurt you.

364
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,980
Bai Ye.

365
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,380
I remember the first time
you came to the Tianji Mansion,

366
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,940
we looked at the stars like this.

367
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,220
At that time...

368
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,460
You didn't ask me to come

369
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,540
to talk about this, did you?

370
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,180
Are you still angry?

371
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,140
I didn't mean to take anyone's life.

372
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,420
I know.

373
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,460
You were trying to protect me

374
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,980
and to protect Little Master.

375
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
You know?

376
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,060
But you hurt Mei Daidai.

377
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,140
I still hate you for that.

378
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,420
I was too impulsive that night.

379
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,460
And I really regret it now.

380
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,820
Douzi,

381
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,980
whoever you are,

382
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,060
I will take care of you.

383
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,620
Will you?

384
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,540
But you know very well

385
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,220
that I am the one in the prophecy...

386
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,980
Yes.

387
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,060
If the Princess of Shengdong
were anyone else,

388
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,260
I would kill her

389
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,260
and the prophecy could be broken.

390
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,380
But it just happens to be you.

391
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,180
I can't do it.

392
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,940
Do you really think

393
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,740
I'll hurt Little Master
and destroy Jixi?

394
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,500
Why would I do that?

395
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,620
Am I crazy?

396
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,340
Believe it or not,

397
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
that is what's going to happen.

398
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,580
Could it be

399
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,580
Little Master does something bad to me?

400
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,460
Impossible.

401
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Even if Little Master tries to hurt me,

402
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,940
I would never hurt him.

403
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,020
Yes.

404
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,980
I know you don't want to hurt him.

405
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,820
Now there's only one way

406
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,020
to protect

407
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,300
both of you.

408
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,700
What is it?

409
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,860
If

410
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,420
you allow me to take you away
from the palace

411
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,100
and away from the Crown Prince,

412
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,380
the prophecy will be broken.

413
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,140
There will be no more of these problems.

414
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,380
What do you mean?

415
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,900
Douzi,

416
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,500
I want to seriously

417
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,820
confess my feelings to you.

418
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,740
Actually, since you first
came to the Tianji Mansion,

419
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,860
I've fallen in love with you.

420
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,220
Every moment I'm with you

421
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,060
is deeply carved into my mind.

422
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,780
And because of you,

423
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,740
my world

424
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,940
has finally brightened up.

425
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Except you,

426
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,740
there's no room in my heart
for another person.

427
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,500
This is my Waning Moon Pendant.

428
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,180
If I present it to His Majesty
asking to leave the palace,

429
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,580
I'm sure he'll allow it.

430
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,100
Will you leave the palace with me?

431
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,980
I won't.

432
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,420
Why?

433
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Because

434
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,780
I've always thought of you as a friend.

435
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,020
Because

436
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,140
in my heart,

437
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,660
there's no room for another person.

438
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,100
Do you know what you're saying?

439
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,060
You know how it will end.

440
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,060
I know what I have to do.

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,940
I don't know.

443
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,540
I only heard that His Highness

444
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,460
was punished to kneel in the rain
for two hours by the Empress,

445
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,900
and have just returned
to the Eastern Palace.

446
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,460
We were ordered
to go to the Imperial Hospital

447
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,620
and get some ginger water bags
to warm him up.

448
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,260
This is worrying.

551
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,100
to follow the folk custom
of counteracting bad luck,

552
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,700
by choosing the Crown Princess
as soon as possible.

553
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,300
The Crown Princess? Who?

554
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,740
Choosing the Crown Princess
for the Crown Prince.

555
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,540
Yeah.

556
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,820
Zhuang Yanyang.

557
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,660
Your Majesty.

558
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,660
Leave the seat next to the Crown Prince

559
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,980
to Mei Yushan.

560
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,180
Why?

561
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,100
How could it be her?

562
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,420
What I want to announce tonight is

563
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,500
that Mei Yushan,
the only daughter of Mei Changjing

564
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,340
will be the Crown Princess.

565
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,220
If you think she doesn't deserve
to be the Crown Princess,

566
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,140
then be it.

567
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,060
What do you mean?

568
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,700
I will ask Father

569
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,180
to dethrone me as the Crown Prince.

570
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,460
I can't believe you said that.

571
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,380
I am terrified every day.

572
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,340
This palace

573
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,060
is full of dangers.

574
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,700
If I hadn't stayed strong for you,

575
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,940
the both of us would have
been pushed into the abyss.

576
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,660
Bai Ye's prophecy alone

577
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,980
is enough to kill us both.

578
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,860
And yet you're telling me today that...

579
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,420
You let me down.

580
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,460
I don't want to see you.

581
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,900
Get out there

582
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,740
and kneel for two hours.

583
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,940
Using marriage to counteract bad luck
is a folk custom.

584
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,780
But now His Majesty is ill
and there is no cure.

585
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,740
We may as well have a try.

586
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,220
Mei Yushan
is Grand Chancellor Mei's daughter.

587
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,780
She's entitled to be the Crown Princess.

588
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,380
She is a bit naughty.

589
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,780
But if Your Majesty
can teach her manners after,

590
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,500
she could be different.

591
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,340
Your Majesty, just grants
the Crown Prince's wish.

592
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,940
The formal ceremony

593
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,780
will be undertaken in my charge.

594
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,740
After the ceremony,

595
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Mei Yushan will move
into the Eastern Palace.

596
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,820
After that, you need to behave yourself

597
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,620
and assist the Crown Prince.

598
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,980
Mei Yushan,

599
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,860
did you hear me?

600
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,780
Why did she leave?

601
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,540
Douzi.

602
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,740
I thought about it for a long time

603
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,100
[Guixiu Pavilion]
and still haven't figured out why.

604
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,580
If it's because of your identity,
now you are the Crown Princess,

605
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,940
no one will dare say anything anymore.

606
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Stop following me.

607
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
You pushed me away at the Academy.

608
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,660
You gave me the cold shoulder
when I delivered you soup.

609
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
When Mother made the announcement,

610
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,700
you just walked away.

611
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,900
There must be a reason for all this.

612
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,980
Why is it?

613
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,020
Tell me.

614
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,260
If you don't tell me,

615
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,020
I'm not letting you leave.

616
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,780
Do you think if I tell you,

617
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,060
you'll let me leave?

618
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,420
You'll just cut my head off.

619
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,340
I'd rather cut off my own head

620
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,860
than hurt you.

621
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,540
Trust me.

622
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,900
Whatever your problem is,

623
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,820
I can solve it for you.

624
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,100
I'll always be there for you.

625
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,420
You can't. No one can.

626
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,580
Anyway, I...

627
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,540
We just can't be together.

628
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,260
You can't be with me,

629
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,500
or you don't want to be with me?

630
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Then you tell me

631
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,020
what we had...

632
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,460
What was that between us?

633
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,020
Was it just my imagination?

634
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,980
Or were you just playing along

635
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
because of my identity?

636
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,740
I dreamed that you came
to see me last night.

637
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,020
You were so real in my dreams.

638
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,020
Like a gentle bunny.

639
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,780
Like a bunny...

640
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,260
Lying lazily on my shoulder.

641
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,420
Please...

642
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,860
Find another Crown Princess.

643
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,380
As long as it's not me.

644
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,380
