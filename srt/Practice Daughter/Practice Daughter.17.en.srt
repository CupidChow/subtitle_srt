How about we don't ask
her to come today?

47

As long as
the Crown Prince stays single,

48

the officials will not stop
giving him a hard time.

For the sake of her defending my son
at the execution ground,

50

I will spend some time training her.

If she can have good manners
after being trained,

I may choose her
to be the Crown Princess.

Have a look, Your Majesty.

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,660
This female one has more fat,

75
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,020
which makes it perfect for soup.

76

77

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,300
- Can you...
- What's...

184
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,020
- memorize all these?
- on your paper?

185
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,180
Everybody, please be quiet.

186
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,900
What is all this?

187
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,180
Three days later comes
the Double Seventh Festival.

188
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,140
There will be one day off
at Chongwen Academy.

189
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,500
And you're allowed to go out
to attend temple fairs.

190
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,180
Finally.

191
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,980
Finally, I can leave the palace.

192
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,900
I'll sneak back
to the Black Dog Alley that day

193
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,860
and visit my three fathers.

194
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,860
Yes, one day off.

195
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,540
Your Highness.

196
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,500
How are things going?

197
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,420
At Your Highness's command,

198
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,340
it's all been arranged.

199
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,580
However,

200
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,140
all shops want to make money
on the Double Seventh Festival.

201
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,620
That street

202
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,100
will cost you this much.

203
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,580
Do I look like a poor man to you?

204
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,580
Don't let Douzi find out.

205
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,300
Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,260
Mr. Bai, did you foresee anything?

207
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,100
Jixi will be destroyed.

208
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,620
His Highness will be exiled.

209
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,300
Are you sure not to report this

210
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,820
to the Crown Prince and the Empress?

211
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,380
Are you trying to protect Miss Mei?

212
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,780
But don't forget, Mr. Bai.

213
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
That maid was brought
to the palace by Miss Mei.

214
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,300
If she deliberately covers up
for that maid...

215
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,340
Impossible.

216
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,660
Why would Douzi
want to hurt His Highness?

217
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,860
Since you know
Douzi wouldn't hurt the Crown Prince,

218
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,380
then why don't we report it?

219
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,060
If I turn in the maid,

220
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,380
no matter what,

221
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,500
Douzi will be implicated in it.

222
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,540
Then I'll be the person

223
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,060
who drags her into such chaos.

224
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,460
Even if the Crown Prince believes her,

225
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,900
what about the Empress?

226
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,980
So no matter what,

227
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,620
this must stay
only between the two of us.

228
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,620
Yes.

229
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,220
We cannot wait any longer.

230
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,780
To protect the Crown Prince

231
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,580
and not get Douzi involved,

232
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
this is the only way.

233
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,380
Only after she dies,

234
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,580
can the Crown Prince and Douzi

235
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,940
be safe.

236
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,460
Mr. Bai,

237
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,380
leave such bloody stuff

238
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,340
to me to do it.

239
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,980
On the night
of the Double Seventh Festival,

240
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,500
there'll be a lot of people,
which will make things easy.

241
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,020
I'll make the arrangements.

242
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,300
If I were caught,

243
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,900
I wouldn't say that you were the one
who told me to do so.

244
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,780
Lingxiao...

245
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,660
Mr. Bai, you have someone
you want to protect.

246
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,940
So do I.

247
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Look at that beautiful lantern.

248
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,660
What is that food?

249
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,500
Why do I want to eat
as soon as I come out?

250
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Forget it.
I've gained too much weight lately.

251
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,860
Come here.

252
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,980
That man is so handsome.

253
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,500
Tell him for me

254
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,860
that I'd like to meet him.

255
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,140
Go.

256
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,780
No.

257
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,740
Just go.

258
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,660
No.

259
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,620
Go.

260
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Please.

261
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,180
Mister.

262
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Look over there...

263
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,340
Okay?

264
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,740
He's looking at me.

265
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,180
At me!

266
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,580
He's looking at me.

267
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,260
He's looking at me.

268
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,060
Check out the fine spices.

269
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,740
How did it go?

270
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,260
I told him

271
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,900
one of my friends wanted to meet him.

272
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,180
And then?

273
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,620
Then

274
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,780
he said

275
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,260
he would also like to get to know...

276
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Me.

277
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,740
You bad girl.

278
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,420
Did you say something bad about me?

279
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,820
I did. So what?

280
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,500
- I did.
- Did you?

281
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,540
Stop right there.

282
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,100
- Bad girl.
- You two, stop fighting.

283
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,740
It's you again.

284
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,060
Trying to get free food again?

285
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,980
If you don't have any money, then leave.

286
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,780
What are you looking at?

287
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,060
I'm talking about you.

288
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,380
Why do you accuse me
of something I didn't do?

289
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,300
You didn't do?

290
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,540
I've run the stall on this street
for three years.

291
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,980
And you've come to get free food
for three years.

292
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,940
You've always said
you would pay back next time.

293
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,380
But never did that happen.

294
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,260
Will you shut your mouth now?

295
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Of course.

296
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,980
Miss, what would you like to eat?

297
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,300
I'll have ten with sesame paste
and ten with garlic.

298
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,500
Sure.

299
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,260
Also,

300
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,140
speak nicely to her in the future.

301
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,660
All right. I got it.

302
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,780
I've been as blind as a bat.

303
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,860
I've failed to recognize a great person.

304
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,180
You've been coming here for three years.

305
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,100
Be quick.

306
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,100
I'll pick them up later.

307
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,820
Okay.

308
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,980
With or without chili?

309
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,260
Want some scallions?

310
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,740
They'll be ready soon.

311
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,180
Miss, please help me.

312
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,540
I need food.

313
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,460
Miss, please save my little sister.

314
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,580
What happened to her?

315
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,980
She has got a cold.

316
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,700
She's lying in the alley up ahead.

317
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,140
Miss, come with me.

318
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,100
Do you want this one?

319
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,460
Look at this. Take a look.

320
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,260
Look at this.

321
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,140
Miss, hurry.

322
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,260
They all are.

323
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,340
Just up ahead.

324
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,340
Miss, hurry up.

325
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,700
My little sister is very sick.

326
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,700
Hurry, Miss.

327
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,820
Let me go.

328
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,540
Let me go.

329
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,140
If you don't let me go,
I'll make you suffer.

330
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Xingshi?

331
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,060
Miss, hurry.

332
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,340
I can't go with you.

333
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,980
Go get a physician.

334
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,580
Let me go.

335
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,020
Let me go. Put me down.

336
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,220
Let's go.

337
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,300
I'll give you money if you want it.

338
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,100
But if you want something else,
you're done.

339
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,460
Who?

340
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,340
Who did this?

341
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,620
Who?

342
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,580
Where are they?

343
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,700
Did I scare them away?

344
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,140
Did I scare them away?

345
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,940
Look at our good silk.

346
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,580
This is beautiful.

347
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,980
I'll buy you one if you want.

348
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,780
How much is this?

349
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,460
Kites.

350
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,260
This one maybe.

351
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,220
How much does this one cost?

352
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,620
What color is it?

353
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,340
That tooth looks so familiar.

354
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,980
It hurts.

355
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,940
You really pulled it out, bad girl.

356
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,060
I'm your father.

357
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,140
First Father.

358
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,820
Third Father.

359
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,700
Second Father.

360
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,500
This is indeed my daughter.

361
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,620
She recognized me
with just a gold tooth.

362
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,220
I've got presents for you.

363
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,380
I looked forward
to leaving the palace for so long

364
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,220
just to see you.

365
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,420
It's like God was helping me.

366
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,900
Did the wishes

367
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,060
I secretly made
to the Bodhisattva come true?

368
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,060
Douzi,

369
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,580
I think

370
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,900
the Crown Prince is really nice.

371
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,660
You and him...

372
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,860
We agree.

373
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,260
What do you mean?

374
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,140
Silly girl,

375
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,340
don't you wonder

376
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,340
why we could show up here

377
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,980
and meet you?

378
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,220
Didn't you notice

379
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,820
that this place was arranged
for you by the Crown Prince?

380
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,340
He rented the whole street for you

381
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,540
trying to create an opportunity

382
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,420
for us to have a special reunion.

383
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,180
Look around if you don't believe me.

384
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,340
Greetings, Miss.

385
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,660
Now you know?

386
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,900
If there were a lady
who pursued me like this,

387
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,500
I'd marry her.

388
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,060
Shameless.

389
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,460

What? Really?

431
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,740
After all these years,

432
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
we finally found her.

433
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Princess?

434
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,500
Which Princess is Xingshi talking about?

435
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,820
But the Princess is in the palace.

436
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,460
It is very dangerous.

437
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,580
Young General,
do you know the Princess's name

438
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,820
and her current identity?

439
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,340
Her name is Douzi.

440
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,300
She is
the Grand Chancellor's daughter now.

441
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,140
What?

442
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,940
How... How could she be
the Grand Chancellor's daughter?

443
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,820
It is a long story.

444
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,780
It has something
to do with the Moon Spirit Pearl.

445
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,380
Our priority now

446
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,020
is to get the Princess and her maid
out of the palace

447
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,300
as soon as possible.

448
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
The Princess's maid?

449
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,620
Yes.

450
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,660
What is going on?

451
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,340
I don't think
it's a complicated situation.

452
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,540
It's just in your self-interest.

453
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,340
Isn't that Su Ruomei's maid, Que?

454
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,100
If you can't get over it,

455
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,980
you don't have to get involved
in the future.

456
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,980
Who's there?

457
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,100
Now that you've seen it.

458
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,540
I have nothing to hide anymore.

459
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,540
They call me Young General

460
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,740
because my father

461
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,980
was the Great General of Shengdong.

462
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
Was he...

463
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,060
Yes.

464
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,500
The one who fulfilled the prophecy

465
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,820
by killing Nangong Yu.

466
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,780
He was Shengdong's Great General
Xuan Bing.

467
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,060
I've been concealing my identity
for years

468
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,100
and staying in Jixi

469
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,540
for only one purpose.

470
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,580
To find our missing Princess.

471
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,380
So you became the Crown Prince's guard

472
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,380
because of Bai Ye's prophecy?

473
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,780
Yes.

474
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,660
I'd been looking for years

475
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,380
but never found anything.

476
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,700
I had no choice

477
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,420
but to stay by the side of Nangong Yao

478
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,540
as a guard.

479
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,980
Are you sure the Princess

480
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,100
you talked about is Douzi?

481
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,540
When the Princess was little,

482
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,820
I saw the fishtail-shaped mark on her.

483
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,820
And in the box in the Black Dog Alley,

484
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,660
I also found things

485
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,180
the Princess had gone missing with.

486
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,060
At first,

487
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,740
I thought you were the Princess.

488
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,820
Who would've known

489
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,260
that Douzi was the Princess of Shengdong?

490
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
No wonder

491
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,380
you cared that much about me.

492
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,660
Miss Mei, don't get me wrong.

493
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,220
I cared about you

494
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,060
not just because I thought
you were the Princess.

495
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,300
Actually, I am...

496
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,420
I...

497
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,020
But how did you find out

498
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,500
about Douzi and me switching bodies?

499
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,660
Do you remember when you asked me

500
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,620
why I knew those three people were

501
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,900
Douzi's fathers?

502
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,500
And in the Guixiu Pavilion,

503
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,140
on the night I gave you medicine,

504
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,140
I heard you and the Princess talking

505
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,700
about trying to switch again.

506
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,540
I didn't believe any of that at first.

507
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,140
But then I went to someone

508
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,260
from whom I got the confirmation

509
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,540
that the Moon Spirit Pearl could indeed
cause people to switch bodies.

510
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,740
Then I confirmed my suspicion.

511
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,500
You are telling me

512
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,500
all of these things...

513
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,300
Mei, don't worry.

514
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,220
I would never hurt you.

515
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,820
And I know

516
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,900
even if you know all about this,

517
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,060
you won't tell anyone.

518
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,620
I'm sure you understand

519
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,700
if Douzi is the Princess of Shengdong,

520
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,220
what will happen to her?

521
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,420
Then what about Que?

522
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,340
Que is also my guard.

523
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,420
She had a misunderstanding
with you earlier.

524
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
But it will never happen again.

525
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,420
Now the Moon Spirit Pearl is broken.

526
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,860
I'm afraid Douzi and I
can't switch our bodies back.

527
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,780
What are you going to do?

528
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,340
In fact, I've also been worried
all this time.

529
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,700
I worry if the Princess's identity
gets revealed,

530
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,700
the whole Jixi palace

531
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,740
will be the most dangerous place
for her.

532
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,540
If it happens,

533
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,260
we won't be able to survive.

534
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,260
So I've decided

535
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,460
to secretly take you out of the palace.

536
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,340
Absolutely no.

537
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,860
Do you know what you're talking about?

538
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,700
You're going to hurt Douzi.

539
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,540
I would never hurt her.

540
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,660
You will have new identities.

541
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,060
We've got former subordinates
of Shengdong out here.

542
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,700
As soon as we get out of the city,

543
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,140
someone will come to pick us up.

544
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,340
After we get back to Shengdong,

545
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,980
no matter how many soldiers Jixi has,

546
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,100
they won't be able to find two girls

547
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,940
who have completely
changed their appearances

548
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,020
and blended in people.

549
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,740
Don't worry.

550
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,380
Everything I do

551
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,100
is to protect the Princess.

552
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,300
And now

553
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,580
I have one more person to protect.

554
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,020
It's you.

555
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,620
So would you like to leave with me?

556
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,900
If you say yes,

557
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,220
I'll give my life to get you out of here

558
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,980
and keep you safe.

559
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,300
Now that you know who I am.

560
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,380
You should also know that my father
is the Grand Chancellor of Jixi.

561
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,420
As the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

562
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,860
how can I elope with the Young General
of an enemy country?

563
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,900
Please help me get back
to the Eastern Palace later.

564
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,780
I need to wait for Douzi.

565
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,460
Okay.

566
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,900
Let's go.

567
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,260
I've been thinking about it for days.

568
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,100
I have a question for you.

569
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,140
It's a little embarrassing to say,

570
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,140
but I have to ask.

571
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,860
Would you like

572
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,300
to stay with me forever?

573
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,620
What do you mean by that?

574
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,780
Just...

575
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,980
Literal meaning.

576
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,020
I...

577
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,020
You what?

578
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,060
