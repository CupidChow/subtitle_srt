00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,860
Hurry up.

186
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,500
Hurry.

187
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,460
You two, go check that side.

188
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,100
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,860
Retreat.

190
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,100
Alright.

191
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,180
Calm down, Miss.

192
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,500
Don't come any closer.

193
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,820
- Don't come any closer.
- Is it her?

194
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,980
It is. Should we attack her?

195
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,540
Yes.

196
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,980
Go ahead and hit her.

197
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,020
Don't come any closer.

198
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,850
[Seventeen years ago]

199
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,380
We're rich!

200
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,620
We're rich!

201
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,980
We'll each have a house

202
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,100
- and marry a girl.
- Two girls.

203
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,140
Two girls.

204
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,100
Come on.

205
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,860
- This chest of gold.
- My brothers,

206
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
time to open the chest.

207
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,140
We are rich.

208
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,940
Que,

209
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,100
is this the chest of gold
you were talking about?

210
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,260
How would I know?

211
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,020
The... the escort team has left.

212
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,900
What... what should we do?

213
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,780
What should we do?

214
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,180
Either we return it
to the escort agency,

215
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,300
or we dump it by the roadside.

216
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,100
Get down.

217
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
What are you doing?

218
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,460
We can't keep this thing.
We must get rid of it.

219
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,860
Wait.

220
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,140
Little baby.

221
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,420
Which one of us can breastfeed her?

222
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,900
This thing must be thrown away.

223
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,420
Stop calling her a thing.

224
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,940
Look at how cute she is.

225
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,380
We have to get rid of her.

226
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,460
We can't.

227
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,220
Look.

228
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,020
We have to get rid of her.

229
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,220
Move aside.

230
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,980
You are so annoying.

231
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,420
You stinky man.

232
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,020
Honestly.

233
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,620
You'll stay with us.

234
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,860
She really can understand.

235
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,380
In the future, if I, Xia Xiaodan,
have food,

236
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,500
so will you.

237
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,100
You can have mine too.

238
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
My brothers,

239
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,500
we need to give her a name, don't we?

240
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,580
She'll be called

241
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,140
Poopy.

242
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,340
Get lost.

243
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,100
That's a bad name.

244
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,460
Why would you call her Poopy?

245
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,700
So, what do you suggest we call her?

246
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,260
A little bean.

247
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,620
We'll call her Little Bean.

248
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,980
She named herself.

249
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,500
That's quite nice.

250
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,060
Little Bean.

251
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,060
Look.

252
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,380
Little Bean.

253
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,260
Cui,

254
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
what time is it?

255
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,020
There are still many things
to arrange before entering the palace.

256
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,980
We can't delay.

257
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,820
Let's freshen up and get changed.

258
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,500
What gibberish
is Little Bean talking about?

259
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,180
Who are you people?

260
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,740
I'm your father.

261
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,900
Have you lost your memory?

262
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,420
- I'm also your father.
- I'm also your father.

263
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,620
- Have you lost your memory?
- Have you lost your memory?

264
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,820
How dare you!

265
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,100
Stop teasing me.

266
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,040
Or else, I'll report you
to the authorities

267
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,740
and have you thrown into prison!

268
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,380
This child must have a fever.

269
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,020
Come, let me take a look.

270
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,780
I think it must be from the commotion
last night.

271
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,820
She's delirious.

272
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,460
I'll handle it.

273
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,180
You'll handle what?

274
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,060
Well, she's obviously been possessed.

275
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,380
We need to pinch her fingers.

276
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,060
Do not harm my hand
that plays the guqin.

277
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,060
What?

278
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,300
Play the guqin?

279
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,220
She plays the guqin?

280
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,980
This hand looks like it's used
for picking cotton,

281
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,180
yet she says she plays the guqin.

282
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,140
It's all over.

283
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,180
This child's brain

284
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,820
is fried.

285
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,420
Pinching her fingers won't work either.

286
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,060
Look at her.

287
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,420
Look at her.

288
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,700
It's like she's possessed.

289
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,900
Ms. Wang, the widow next door said

290
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,740
when possessed, we have to pour
black dog blood on the person.

291
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,140
Stop it.

292
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,580
It hurts.

293
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,700
Nangong Yao?

294
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,820
Oh, come on.

295
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,060
Isn't it just a dream?

296
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,340
Miss.

297
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,020
- What is this place?
- Miss.

298
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,180
I've been chased all night

299
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,500
and this dream isn't over yet.

300
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,580
Whose shoe is this anyway?

301
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,620
Never mind.

302
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,180
When in doubt,
retreat is the best strategy.

303
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,060
Good morning, Miss.

304
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,340
You are here to see me?

305
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Miss.

306
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,740
What's this supposed to mean?

307
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,220
Miss, it's you who instructed us
to scatter flower petals

308
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,140
like this every day.

309
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,460
This way, every morning
when you open the window,

310
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,660
you can smell the fragrance of flowers

311
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,140
So, may I ask,

312
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,700
what were you chasing me for last night?

313
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,180
Well, if you run,
of course I'll chase after you.

314
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,420
Of course, I'll run if you chase me.

315
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,180
Miss, why are you running away?

316
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,700
Who sneak attacked me again?

317
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
Don't come any closer.

318
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,420
I'm not Little Bean.

319
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,620
You've got the wrong person.

320
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,860
- Don't!
-Don't!

321
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,300
You must have been frightened
last night,

322
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,740
causing you to lose your mind.

323
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,140
What should I do?

324
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,220
Stop.

325
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,540
I haven't cried yet.

326
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,620
Why are you crying?

327
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,620
Tell me.

328
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,300
Who are you?

329
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,500
I-I am your maid, Cui.

330
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,180
You are my maid?

331
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,180
Then am I your young lady?

332
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,820
I am your maid

333
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
and you are my young lady.

334
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
Which household do you work for?

335
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,260
I work

336
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,740
for the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

337
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,180
Miss, please don't scare me.

338
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,500
You're a maid
from the Grand Chancellor's Residence,

339
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,700
then I must be
the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

340
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,740
Tell me.

341
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,020
Does your young lady
know any witchcraft?

342
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,380
What exactly happened last night?

343
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,780
Miss, what happened to you?

344
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,260
Last night, during the lunar eclipse,

345
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,780
all the other young ladies
were escorted out of the museum,

346
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,900
but you were the only one
who didn't come out.

347
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,380
My heart dropped.

348
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,100
I knew something must have happened.

349
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,420
If that's the case,

350
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,180
the person
my three fathers took away is...

351
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,060
Miss, where are you going?

352
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,020
Going home.

353
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,900
Miss, you're finally back to normal.

354
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,620
Quickly, help our young lady
freshen up and change clothes.

355
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

356
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,220
Come over.

357
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,580
Why are you taking off my clothes?

358
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,540
Don't touch me.

359
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,020
Why all the fuss?

360
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:33,900
I...

361
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,460
It's exhausting to talk to you.

362
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm thirsty.

363
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,740
Miss.

364
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,500
What is this?

365
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,180
This is salt water for gargling.

366
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,380
Why didn't you say so earlier?
I swallowed it all.

367
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,060
It's so salty.

368
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,380
Miss.

369
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,820
What's this now?

370
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,180
Miss, this is soapberry water
for washing hands.

371
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,860
Could you please stop
putting these strange things

372
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,100
in front of me?

373
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,660
I really need to go home now.

374
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,700
- I want to go home.
- Miss!

375
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,020
- Miss, wait.
- What are you doing?

376
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,420
- Hurry and help her change clothes.
- Yes.

377
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,620
Aren't I well-dressed already?

378
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,780
Why do I need to change clothes?

379
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,340
Miss, didn't you say it yourself?

380
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,820
Different occasions
require different attire,

381
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,940
all following proper etiquette.

382
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
There are clothes for sleeping,

383
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,900
clothes for washing up,

384
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,820
clothes for meals,

385
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,740
and clothes for going out.

386
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,900
We can't wear the same outfit
for everything.

387
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,860
There are different clothes

388
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,180
- for different purposes.
- Alright.

389
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,340
I get it.

390
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,660
Let's get changed.

391
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,740
Is your young lady
a chameleon in disguise?

392
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,500
Your Highness,

393
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,060
after sealing the museum last night,

394
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,420
I led the guards to search
both inside and outside the museum

395
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,140
and interrogated all the servants,

396
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,140
but we did not find
any suspicious individuals.

397
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,780
Local weapon shops
all have their own markings.

398
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,940
Buyers also leave information.

399
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,660
Go and investigate.

400
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,100
Yes, Your Highness.

401
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,060
What's the deal
with the liquor from yesterday?

402
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,140
The liquor
that Your Highness drank yesterday

403
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,940
was the Jade Spring
brought from the palace

404
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,540
by Eunuch Song
by the order of Her Majesty.

405
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,740
I've thoroughly inspected

406
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,020
all the liquor and liquor vessels

407
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,660
and found nothing suspicious.

408
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,140
The young ladies and palace maids
also showed no signs of abnormality.

409
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,300
The Jade Spring is smooth upon entry

410
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,740
but packs quite a punch afterward.

411
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,580
Your Highness drank it
for the first time,

412
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,580
so perhaps you had a bit too much.

413
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,260
Xing Shi, you may leave now.

414
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,180
Yes, Your Highness.

415
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,780
Those girls mentioned about entering
the palace to study last night.

416
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,980
What's that about?

417
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,780
Your Highness,

418
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,220
Her Majesty is planning
for your future.

419
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,620
If a suitable consort
can be chosen from these girls,

420
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,020
it will silence those officials.

421
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,300
Rest assured, Your Highness.

422
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,980
These young ladies' families
have had no connection

423
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,420
- with Shengdong for three generations.
- Enough!

424
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,500
Forgive me, Your Highness.

425
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,460
Is Mei Yushan on the list
of those selected

426
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,500
to enter the palace this time?

427
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,460
Your Highness,

428
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,220
the first one chosen
by Her Majesty is Miss Mei.

429
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,740
However,
Miss Mei's performance yesterday

430
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,540
was rather unimpressive.

431
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,700
If you're not interested in her,

432
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,220
just ignore her.

433
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,020
You may leave now.

434
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,740
Yes, Your Highness.

435
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,460
Your Highness.

436
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,080
[Dong Xi]
I went to relief organizations

437
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,580
to investigate,

438
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,020
[Dong Xi]

439
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,680
[Dong Xi]
and it is indeed

440
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,420
as the Grand Tutor described.

441
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,740
Disaster victims go missing every day.

442
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,460
And they are mostly young women
and children.

443
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,820
This matter is so suspicious.

444
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,140
It seems I have to go
and check it out myself.

445
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,820
Miss.

446
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,020
Miss.

447
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,820
Miss, wait for me.

448
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,900
Miss.

449
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,860
Miss.

450
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,380
Food is the most important thing
in the world.

451
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,140
Miss.

452
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,700
Your Highness.

453
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,350
[Guanyue Pavilion]

454
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,540
Why should I be afraid of him?

455
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,260
I'm the Grand Chancellor's daughter now.

456
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,500
Your Highness,
come join me for a meal. Come.

457
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,820
This...

458
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,980
This is specially prepared
for His Highness.

459
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,540
Nan Bei.

460
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,140
You...

461
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,980
You and Dong Xi may leave now.

462
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,060
It's all asymmetrical now. You...

463
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,900
Everyone here is a guest.

464
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,300
Come on, take a seat.

465
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,220
Sit.

466
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,460
I haven't touched this one, nor this.

467
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,340
Here, have some.

468
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,140
Can you hold the same food
with both hands?

469
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,100
Either both hands hold sesame cakes

470
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,980
or both hands hold fried dough sticks.

471
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,780
Sure.

472
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,740
Thank you, I'm not hungry.

473
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,780
I just care about symmetry.

474
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,140
So particular!

475
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,740
No wonder even the names
of people around him

476
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,540
have to cover all directions:
[*Nan Bei sounds like south and north]

477
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,380
south, north, east, and west.
[*Dong Xi sounds like east and west]

478
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,260
Isn't the middle part missing?

479
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,740
Shouldn't him be called Zhonggong Yao
[*Zhong means middle]

480
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,140
instead of Nangong Yao?

481
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,860
Forget it, I can't be bothered with you.

482
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,620
I heard you held your own maid hostage
last night.

483
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,660
Why are you so nervous?

484
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,460
It's just a casual question.

485
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,020
I'm just curious why Miss Mei

486
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,820
behaves so differently
in public and in private.

487
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,140
So he was calling me Miss Mei
last night.

488
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,900
It's all

489
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,260
because of those people

490
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,580
who blocked me from going home

491
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,540
when I was in a hurry to get back.

492
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,140
Then, I was frightened again
in the corridor.

493
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,580
- If you bring up last night again,
- I...

494
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,820
I swear I'll kill you.

495
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,620
Such a big reaction.

496
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,540
I meant

497
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,060
the sudden appearance
of two knives yesterday.

498
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
I thought

499
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,660
you were referring to something else.

500
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,580
I thought

501
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,220
you were talking about your butt.

502
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,780
Where does it hurt?

503
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,660
My butt.

504
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,500
The Crown Prince is unexpectedly coarse.

505
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,300
Mei Yushan!

506
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,660
Who?

507
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,100
Your Highness, calm down.

508
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,940
I won't mention your butt again
in the future.

509
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,300
You're still talking about it!

510
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
My father said

511
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,260
that frowning blocks good luck.

512
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,740
You look better when you smile.

513
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm full now, so I'm leaving.

514
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,060
You...

515
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,380
Miss.

516
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,340
Mei Yushan!

517
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,140
Miss!

518
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,140
Miss.

519
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,860
Miss, let's go back.

520
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,660
My friend,

521
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,700
I have important matters to attend to.

522
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,900
Let's part ways here.

523
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,860
I still need to find your young lady.

524
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,780
Miss,

525
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,460
let's go back.

526
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,540
Go back?

527
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,580
This is...?

528
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,740
This is for taking you home.

529
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,580
- Greetings, Miss.
- Greetings, Miss.

530
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,260
- Greetings, Miss.
- Greetings, Miss.

531
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,500
- Greetings, Miss.
- Greetings, Miss.

532
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,300
Slow down.

533
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,460
Stop!

534
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,260
Miss, what's the matter?

535
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,860
I can't do this anymore.

536
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,620
I'll walk. I'll walk by myself.

537
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,060
Careful.

538
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,620
Miss, are you alright?

539
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,860
My father is right.

540
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,100
It's true that a mountain boar
can't eat fine bran.

541
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,260
This sedan chair is shaking me to death.

542
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,260
Well, Miss...

543
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,100
[Huiju Grocery Store]

544
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,660
I'll go check out this store.

545
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,980
I'll come out soon
and we'll go back together.

546
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,740
Wait for me here.

547
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,620
Don't follow me.

548
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,060
Yes, Miss.

549
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,820
Please.

550
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,900
How did the maids
from wealthy families grow up?

551
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,660
If they were in the Black Dog Alley,

552
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,180
they'd have been swindled blind
long ago.

553

Que Kuai'er, move aside.

554
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,500
You...

555
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,860
Tell me. What kind of sorcery
are you using?

556
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,060
I was about to ask you the same.

557
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,380
Quickly return my body to me.

558
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,900
That's an outrageous claim.

559
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,260
Clearly, you're the one
occupying my body.

560
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,020
I'm occupying your body? I...

561
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,220
[Little Bean. Mei Yushan]
Lass.

562
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,100
Who occupied your body?

563
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,980
Second Father, this doesn't concern you.

564
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,060
I'll talk to you later.

565
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,300
You, come down.

566
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,300
What exactly is going on?

567
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,460
How am I supposed to know?

568
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,340
I fell down that day

569
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,740
and things turned out like this.

570
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,460
Fell down?

571
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,420
- Moon Spirit Pearl!
- Moon Spirit Pearl!

572
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
Where's the pearl?

573
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,060
The pearl...

574
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,340
I lost it.

575
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,940
Who are you?

576
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,700
What gives you the right
to lose the pearl

577
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,220
we spent so much effort to steal?

578
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,020
I...

579
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,140
You even tracked us down to this place.

580
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,980
What do you want?

581
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,820
- I'm here to see...
- Don't fight.

582
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,300
She's here to see me.

583
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,420
Move aside.

584
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,180
Miss,

585
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,700
I didn't sleep a wink last night

586
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,500
and I finally figured it out.

587
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,380
Why do you persistently chase after me?

588
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,300
Right?

589
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,260
I've been living a solitary life,

590
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,740
but unexpectedly, when I'm at this age,

591
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,660
I've gained your favor.

592
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,900
Why does my desolate world

593
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,540
suddenly become so bright?

594
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,420
I'm willing.

595
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,380
Are you also possessed?

596
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,220
Get lost.

597
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,380
What do you mean by possessed?

598
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,740
Why would I be possessed?

599
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,420
If she doesn't like me,

600
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,820
why would she smile at me?

601
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,180
Why would she cover for us
to escape?

602
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,260
I'm Little Bean.

603
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
Don't spout nonsense.

604
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,860
- You...
- Big Head Yu,

605
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,940
Have your hemorrhoids healed?

606
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,220
You dare to eat spicy chicken feet now?

607
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,420
Little Bean, you brat,

608
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,700
you betrayed me.

609
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
And you.

610
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,900
Do you want me to bring out

611
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,940
the 59 rejected love letters

612
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,140
you wrote to Ms. Wang?

613
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,300
Darn you, Dan!

614
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,460
You've also written love letters
to Ms. Wang?

615
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,740
And you.

616
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,220
Shouldn't you return the money

617
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,660
for that bone-strengthening medicine
first?

618
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,020
Gather around.
I think she really is Little Bean.

619
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,140
Yes.

620
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,180
You are driving me crazy.

621
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,860
Can't you even recognize
your own daughter?

622
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,220
What on earth is going on here?

623
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,820
I have no idea.

624
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,460
Last night, it was pitch black,

625
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,740
then somehow I ended up
swapping bodies with that girl.

626
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,340
Swapping bodies?

627
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,260
Is that even possible?

628
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,980
Where's that girl?

629
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,020
