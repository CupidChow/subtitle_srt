43
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,300

for two days and two nights.

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
What are you doing here?

48
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,740
I heard you were locked up
in the Eastern Palace.

49
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
I got worried,

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,260
so I came to save you.

51
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,140
Save me?

52
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,580

Does

54
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,740
Little Master... Does he know?

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,620
The Crown Prince knows who you are.

56
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,140
That's why he locked you up.

57
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,340
Did he say anything?

58
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,900
He...

59
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,980
He didn't say anything.

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,980
I don't know what he is thinking

61
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,580
or what he plans to do to you.

62
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,340
If he knows, he knows.

63
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,060
We have to face it
sooner or later anyway.

64
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,780
If you agree,

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,580
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

66
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,940
I'm not leaving.

67
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,300
If he wants to arrest me,

68
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,340
even if I'm out of here,

69
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,460
he'll still bring me back.

70
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,300
Although it's probably also dangerous
outside the palace,

71
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,100
if you stay in the palace,

72
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,460
your life will be in danger.

73
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,500
For the Crown Prince,

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,180
the bigger picture always comes first.

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,060
He can kill me if he wants to.

76
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,660
I don't believe he could actually do it.

77
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,100
It's probably because I cursed him
for two days and two nights,

78
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,540
now he's too angry to see me.

79
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,380
He said he'd cut his own head off,

80
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,860
instead of hurting me.

81
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,060
He has locked you up,

82
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,340
yet you still trust him.

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,700
I've tried so hard to protect you,

84
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,900
but you choose to ignore it.

85
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,460
You're so stubborn.

86
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,540

about the consequences?

88
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,980
not only will you lose your life,

89
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,180
the Crown Prince
will be implicated, too.

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,860

will be destroyed because of you.

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,700
what you want?

93
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,020
How could I have such strength
to make all this happen?

94
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,180
Have you seen
the Little Master's ability?

95
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,100
He can knock me out with a single punch.

96
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,860
And I hate studying so much,

97
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,660
yet I can't even destroy
the Chongwen Academy.

98
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,260
How could I destroy a country?

99
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,100
Besides,

100
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,940
I never meant to hurt anyone.

101
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,460
Even less likely to hurt Little Master.

102
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,100
Do you think it's possible
that you had a bad dream one day

103
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,180
and after you woke up,

104
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,740
you blamed it on me?

105
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,220
When the Crown Prince was still little,

106
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,140
I predicted this.

107
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,140
I had never even seen you back then.

108
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,220
Douzi,

109
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,860
trust me.

110
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,580
As long as we can stay out of this...

111
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,980
for the rest of my life,

112
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,380
I promise to keep you safe.

113
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,140
No matter what you say,

114
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,340
I'm not leaving.

115
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,420
You tell him to come to see me.

116
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,140
You'd rather die with the Crown Prince

117
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,780
than leave with me, right?

118
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,460
You tell him to come to see me.

119
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,180
You need to think this through.

120
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,660
If this prophecy comes true,

121
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,700
the two of you
won't be able to handle it.

122

We've been friends for a while,

123
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,180
yet it turns out

124
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,660
that I am just an outsider to you.

125
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,580
You are not

126
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,580

127
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,420

You've found the Princess of Shengdong?

Who is she?

142
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,140
Where is she?

143
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,620
She is the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

144

Mei Yushan.

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,460
Bai Ye!

146
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,660
How could it be her?

147
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,940
How could she be
the Grand Chancellor's daughter?

148
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,220
That's nonsense.

149
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,100
Bai Ye, how dare you!

150
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,060
Your Highness,

151
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,780
Mei Yushan is my own flesh and blood.

152
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,740
How can she be
the Princess of Shengdong?

153
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,900
Your Highness, I demand

154
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,220
to expel him from the hall.

155
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,460
The Mei Yushan I'm talking about
is not your daughter.

156
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,860
Because of the Moon Spirit Pearl,

157
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,460
Mei Yushan and the Princess of Shengdong
switched bodies.

The Mei Yushan you see now

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,500
is the Princess of Shengdong.

160
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,620
And Mr. Mei, your own daughter

161
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,500
has become her maid.

162
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,180
This... This is impossible.

163
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,460
Is there really such a ridiculous thing?

164
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,500
Unbelievable.

165
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,580
You shouldn't have shown up

166
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,220
and said these words.

167
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,340
Are you trying to get something?

168
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,820
Or do you want to defy me in public?

169
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm just trying to protect you,
Your Highness,

170
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,220
and the people of Jixi.

171
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,100
Are you trying to protect me

172
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,940
or getting revenge
for your unrequited love?

173
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,060
You know better than them

don't believe she would hurt me.

Okay.

Then I can tell you,

Your Highness...

182
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
you will die by her hands.

183
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,300
Bai Ye has never been wrong.

184
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,020
Do you think she came here

185
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,540
- to kill the Crown Prince?
- No way.

186
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Impossible.

187
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,260
She can't even defeat me.

188
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,740
So how can she kill His Highness?

189
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,660
- The Crown Prince...
- Exactly.

190
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,380
- is not seeing anyone.
- Right?

191
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,340
I haven't seen
the Crown Prince in a while.

192
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,140
Me neither.

193
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,420
This girl has less manners,

194
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,860
but it looks like
she will not harm others.

195
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,740
I don't believe

196
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,820
that she would kill His Highness.

197
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,500
But Bai Ye has no grudge against her.

198
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,980
- Why would he make this up...
- Yeah.

199
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,140
to set her up?

200
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,940
Pin,

201
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,380
what do you think?

202
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,060
Come here, all of you.

203
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,100
Help me on this.

204
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
With Pin's intelligence,
can he come up with anything brilliant?

205
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,060
What are you drawing here?

206
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,220
Mei Yushan is the Princess of Shengdong.

207
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,180
Why would she kill His Highness?

208
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,940
I told you her name wasn't Mei Yushan.

209
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,100
It's weird.

210
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,500
Her name is Douzi.

211
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,820
How many times have I told you

212
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,220
that they switched bodies?

213
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,820
Mei and Douzi.

214
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,980
I know now.

215
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,460
Mei is the Princess of Shengdong.

216
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,740
It's not like that.

217
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,220
It's like you understood nothing.

218
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,780
Her name is not Mei, but Douzi.

219
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,260
Pin, there's no one called Mei.

220
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,100
Right.

221
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,860
You can't even figure
out such simple logic,

222
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,940
yet you want to gossip with us.

223
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,060
You're too stupid.

224
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,620
I think we should ask Pin

225
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,860
to deal with the Princess of Shengdong.

226
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,460
Why?

227
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,300
Because

228
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,660
your stupidity can kill people.

229
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,420
- Right.
- If you ask me,

230
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,340
I'd say, fortunately,

231
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,180
someone's going to give her a lesson.

232
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,100
Do you remember the last time?

233
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,780
She even cried for the rabbit
that we were going to hunt.

234
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,020
Shengdong sent her
to kill the Crown Prince.

235
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,900
Are all the people in her country dead?

236
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,060
They are.

237
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,660
My father fought in the war
to eliminate them.

238
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,940
He was even awarded for it.

239
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,020
She is indeed stupid.

240
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,420
She's been taken down
before she becomes the Crown Princess.

241
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,060
So stupid.

242
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,900
With her little intelligence,

243
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,140
her trying to destroy our country

244
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,020
is a huge joke.

245
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
Exactly.

246
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,860
Yeah. She is not smart

247
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,220
and she doesn't have
strong martial arts skills.

248
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,980
The last time His Highness
taught her archery,

249
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,100
she failed to master it after an hour.

250
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,460
How could she kill someone?

251
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
I think

252
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,100
she is most likely wronged this time.

253
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,500
What do we do then?

254
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,900
Will Her Majesty kill her?

255
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,020
Even though we don't usually like her,

256
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,500
this time,

257
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,260
we need to put that aside.

258
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,140
It's...

259
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,820
This time Douzi is in big trouble.

260
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,780
Let's find a solution.

261
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,380
Yeah, let's do something.

262
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,460
[Eastern Palace]
The Princess of Shengdong is cunning.

263
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,980
She's evil.

264
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,260
Your Highness, we ask to see you,
and please don't be deceived by her.

265
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,460
Your Highness, please make up your mind.

266
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,100
Please make up your mind.

267
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,740
Punish the evil.

268
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,740
Your Highness.

269
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,820
Your Highness,

270
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,980
if you don't show up,

271
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
I'm afraid they'll tear
down the door of the Eastern Palace.

272
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,860
You also think Douzi is evil?

273
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,300
I certainly believe
that Miss Mei is innocent.

274
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,980
But now...

275
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,140
Then we don't need to explain to them.

276
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,220
If I go out now,

277
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,540
they'll only act more unscrupulously.

278
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,220
We ask to see His Highness.

279
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,580
Sirs.

280
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,500
Please listen to me.

281
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,180
His Highness
is not feeling very well today.

282
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,500
He is resting now.

283
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,740
- Who do you think you are?
- Please go back.

284
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
We want to see His Princess.

285
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,620
Your Highness.

286
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,260
You can't do this.

287
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,900
Your Highness,

288
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,660
I have something urgent to attend to.

289
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,780
Please allow me to leave.

290
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,220
Are you crazy? If you go out now,

291
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,380
what if they break in?

292
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
Let him go.

293
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,380
I'm not afraid of them.

294
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

295
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,620
- She is bad luck.
- Kill her.

296
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,460
Make up your mind.

297
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,580
Kill her.

298
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,860
- Kill her.
- She will harm our country and people.

299
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,740
- We must kill her.
- She will harm our country and people.

300
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,460
She has evil intentions.

301
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,100
If you don't kill her now,
I will kill myself here today.

302
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,020
Kill her.

303
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,980
Kill her.

304
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,500
You have to make up your mind.
You can't wait any longer.

305
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,580
Come out, Your Highness.

306
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,140
Your Highness,
put our country above all else.

307
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,780
Put our country above all else.

308
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,780
Your Highness, make up your mind now.

309
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,460
You can't do this, Your Highness.

310
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,740
Your Highness, think of the civilians.

311
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,420
Your Highness.

312
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,100
Please abdicate.

313
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,340
I want to see the Crown Prince.

314
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,740
Please abdicate.

315
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,340
You've abandoned our country.

316
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,580
Please abdicate.

317
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,220
Ask the Crown Prince to come out.

318
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,980
We need to go in.

319
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,900
What's going on out there?

320
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,460
Please just eat, Miss.

321
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,780
His Highness has suffered a lot for you.

322
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,020
What's going on? Just tell me.

323
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,460
Everyone in the palace says
that you'll harm the country and people.

324
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,740
Those ministers out there are saying

325
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
that if the Crown Prince
didn't execute you,

326
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,660
they'd kill themselves for the country.

327
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
They keep knocking at the gate,
which is almost destroying the gate.

328
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,180
You might as well eat.

329
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,340
If you starve,

330
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,380
His Highness will blame us.

331
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,940
I am not eating.

332
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,140
These stupid Jixi ministers

333
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,220
had killed my parents

334
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,100
and now are trying to blame me
for something I didn't do.

335
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,540
Do they

336
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,860
even have consciences?

337
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,260
Are they saying
that I'll destroy the country?

338
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,300
All right, I'll show you
how I'm going to destroy the country.

339
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,500
Feels great.

340
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,900
Miss Mei, how are you?

341
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,940
It hurts so much.

342
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,780
It hurts...

343
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,380
Why did you

344
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,060
tell Miss Mei all this all of a sudden?

345
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,060
I did not do it on purpose.

346
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,140
Your Highness, please go see her.

347
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,660
Miss Mei... She got hurt.

348
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,300
I'm not lying to you.

349
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,500
Miss Mei smashed things out of anger

350
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,900
and cut her hand.

351
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,100
She was bleeding.

352
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,940
You were told to look after her.
But you...

353
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,660
I am sorry.

354
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,700
I will go and have her wound dressed.

355
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,780
I'll go.

356
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,220
Bring the medicine kit.

357
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Leave me alone.

358
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,660
Didn't you say

359
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,620
that you'd never see me again?

360
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,620
The wound will drain pus
if left untreated.

361
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,220
Do you want to be a maimed person?

362
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,540
Do you really think I will hurt you?

363
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,500
With my intelligence,

364
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,220
I can't even write
a complicated character.

365
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,980
What kind of scheming can I possibly do?

366
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,380
If you hadn't taught me to copy books,

367
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,460
I couldn't even have written
the word "destruction".

368
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,860
I can't ride or shoot.

369
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,220
I can't use a knife either.

370
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,100
I even trip myself going up the stairs.

371
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,500
How can I destroy the country?

372
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,300
Do I use my hands or my mouth?

373
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,220
Or do I scold them to death?

374
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,900
You'd rather trust them than me.

375
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,940
I regret liking you so much.

376
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,420
I was so wrong about you.

377
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,580
Bai Ye was right.

378
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,380
You really care more
about the big picture.

379
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,140
Well...

380
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,260
Just kill me.

381
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,380
Why locking me up in here?

382
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,580
Haven't you changed then?

383
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,940
Have you forgotten

384
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,780
what you said
the night of the Mid-Autumn dinner?

385
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,900
You also cared more
about the big picture.

386
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,020
Those days at the Chongwen Academy

387
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
were the best time of my life.

388
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,140
Since I met you,

389
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,700
every move you make
has drawn my attention.

390
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,580
When you laugh, I feel happy.

391
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,980
When you cry, I feel sad.

392
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,140
Your slightest discomfort makes me hurt

393
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,220
and worry about you all the time.

394
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,580
So do you understand...

395
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,460
how I feel

396
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,500
about what you said to me...

397
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,420
the night of the Mid-Autumn dinner?

398
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,260
When I knew you were the one
in the prophecy...

399
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,900
other than locking you up here,

400
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,700
what other options did I have?

401
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,820
What do you mean by that?

402
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,740
So you choose to believe them,
don't you?

403
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,620
If that's all you have to say,

404
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,780
just kill me right away.

405
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,020
No hurry.

406
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,780
Maybe you'll die eventually.

407
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,220
But I won't give you the chance
to die here.

408
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,700
Your Highness, please kill her now.

409
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,900
Kill her.

410
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,580
Kill her.

411
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,300
Don't these old men feel tired at all?

412
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,860
I'm tired of just hearing them.

413
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,820
Zuo.

414
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,500
Do you have everything ready?

415
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,140
Ready for what?

416
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,500
Look at the situation here.

417
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,980
There won't be a wedding.

418
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,620
Exactly.

419
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,220
You still have to prepare for it.

420
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,740
- Your Highness, execute her.
- Your Highness, execute her.

421
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,860
Make way. Make way.

422
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,260
- Please abdicate.
- Execute her.

423
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,100
How dare you!

424
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,580
The Crown Prince is coming out.

425
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,380
You dare to break
into the Eastern Palace?

426
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,020
Your Highness,

427
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,300
p... p...

428
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,420
Pooh? Back at you.

429
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,460
Back at your whole family.

430
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,900
Pooh. Pooh. Pooh.

431
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,940
Please cooperate.

432
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,580
I'm here to arrest her.

433
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,860
Go.

434
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,260
- How dare you...
- Right...

435
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,420
Just arrest her.

436
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,980
The Eastern Palace is not a place
where you can just come and search.

437
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,900
Do you want to get yourselves killed?

438
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,340
Are... Are...

439
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,140
- Yes...
- Are...

440
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,420
I am threatening you.

441
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,660
I dare you to take one more step.

442
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,260
We are here to arrest that evil girl.

443
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,460
Right. That's right.

444
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,660
That evil girl deceives people.
She is evil.

445
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,980
She should be arrested.

446
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,540
There's an evil girl
in the Eastern Palace?

447
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,620
So you mean

448
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,420
I am the evil king?

449
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,500
Mei... Mei...
[*Sounds the same as the word "no"]

450
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,740
Then just get away.

451
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,900
Mei Yushan.

452
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,300
Go search for her.

453
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,420
Who dares!

454
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,060
This is...

455
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,700
What's he doing?

456
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,780
- She should be arrested.
- Right.

457
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,260
She should be arrested.

458
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,500
I guess you have a death wish.

459
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,220
Her Majesty is here.

460
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,780
Your Majesty, all our best wishes.

461
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,500
I told him to arrest her.

462
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,500
Now bring out the evil girl.

463
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,580
He can do nothing now.

464
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,180
Right.

465
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,020
Let's see how she

466
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,380
escapes this time
after Her Majesty has given the order.

467
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:34,980
Exactly.

468
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,580
Fortunately, Her Majesty is here.

469
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,180
The evil girl is coming out.

470
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,540
Finally caught her.

471
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,260
There is hope for the country.

472
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,540
Our country is saved.

473
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,140
Right.

474
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,500
[Huacai Hall]

475
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,300
Make way. Step aside.

476
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,620
- The evil girl who hurts our people.
- Right.

477
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,060
- She is bad luck.
- She is bad luck.

478
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,540
- Her Majesty will take care of it.
- Evil.

479
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,460
- Kneel.
- Kneel.

480
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,540
Kneel.

481
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,900
- Kneel.
- Kneel.

482
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,980
You evil.

483
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,380
You harbored evil intentions

484
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,380
to approach the Crown Prince.

485
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,500
Are you trying to

486
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,900
fulfill the prophecy
of the country's destruction?

487
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,780
I would have done so if I wanted to.

488
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,220
I wouldn't have waited until now.

489
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,860
Blaming me for all these

490
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,900
made-up sins,

491
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,380
what kind of an empress are you?

492
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,820
You still refuse to confess?

493
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,820
Slap her in the face.

494
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,420
Good one.

495
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,860
- She deserves it.
- She deserves it.

496
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,700
Bad luck.

497
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,820
- Bad luck.
- Exactly.

498
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,380
What am I guilty of?

499
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,340
My only mistake is
that I shouldn't have come here

500
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,860
and seen your faces.

501
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,020
You make me sick.

502
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,900
Will you confess or not?

503
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,660
If I want to kill you,

504
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,300
you'll be dead right away.

505
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,260
Kill me if you want.

506
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,140
What are you waiting for?

507
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,220
Are you afraid of killing
the wrong person and being doomed?

508
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,060
How dare you!

509
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,380
At this moment,

510
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,340
you still have the nerve to talk back.

511
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,260
Kill her.

512
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,860
Step aside.

513
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,060
Kill her.

514
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,740
Step aside.

515
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,900
- His Highness.
- His Highness.

516
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,700
- You must execute her.
- You...

517
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,780
Stand down.

518
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,060
Your Majesty,

519
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,660
His Highness must execute her
in public today.

520
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,340
Only then can we be relieved.

521
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,820
Ever since she entered the palace,

522
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,100
she has been notorious
for her domineering behaviors.

523
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,140
But still, she won
the Crown Prince's favor.

524
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,020
We fear that the Crown Prince
is bewitched by her,

525
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,220
so he can't tell right from wrong now
and becomes too softhearted.

526
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,820
Therefore we beg,

527
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,140
for the sake of Jixi,

528
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,540
to dethrone the Crown Prince

529
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,620
and make the Eighth Prince
the new Crown Prince.

530
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,940
No need to speak out of turn.

531
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,700
The Crown Prince understands
the important principle thoroughly

532
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,500
and despises evil like an enemy.

533
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,180
He'll kill this evil girl.

534
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,540
Even if there are a hundred
or thousand evil girls,

535
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,460
he will kill all of them.

536
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,420
Between an evil girl and the country,

537
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,460
he certainly knows
which one is more important.

538
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,420
Mother, you are right.

539
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,780
Between a woman and my country,

540
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,420
of course, I know what's more important.

541
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,660
The Eighth Prince is virtuous,

542
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,860
but he is too kind and spontaneous.

543
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,180
Yet now corruption is rife among Jixi.

544
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,780
Treacherous ministers are in power.

545
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,620
If we make him the Crown Prince,

546
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,940
we'll be neglecting the Imperial Court
and our people,

547
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,900
which is irresponsible and unfair.

548
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,820
I, Nangong Yao,

549
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,420
since childhood, have listened to Father
tell me how to be an emperor

550
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,380
and the Grand Tutor tell me
how to govern the country.

551
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,700
I can never do

552
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,820
such irresponsible and unfair things.

553
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,220
Well said.

554
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,220
If your father hears this,

555
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,140
he'll be incredibly gratified.

556
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,100
Your Majesty.

557
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,300
Your Majesty, you are wise.

558
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,420
Considering my hard work

559
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,940
over the years,

560
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,820
please spare her life.

561
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,620
It's... It's my daughter's body,
after all.

562
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,740
Your Majesty.

563
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,540
How dare you

564
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,220
beg for mercy for the evil!

565
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,260
Get him out of here.

566
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,300
Your Majesty.

567
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,380
Please spare her life, Your Majesty.

568
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,340
Your Majesty...

569
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,380
I've said before,

570
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,060
that prophecy was nonsense.

571
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,060
I can't believe the one
who will kill me in the end

572
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,580
is you.

573
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,820
[Tie the knot]

574
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,180
The wedding is completed.

575
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,180
Best wishes to the Crown Prince
and the Crown Princess.

576
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,580
We wish you a happy marriage

577
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,020
for a hundred years.

578
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,740
You are destined for one another

579
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
and will grow old together.

580
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,220
Ridiculous.

581
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,900
The Crown Prince is stupid.

582
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,540
This... This is not proper.

583
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,260
How could you do such a reckless thing?

584
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,660
I told you,

585
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,820
I'd rather cut off my own head

586
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,540
than hurt you.

587
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,380
Abdicate.

588
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,900
Abdicate.

589
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,020
I am the master of my fate.

590
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,620
I will make her the Crown Princess,
which cannot be changed.

591
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,300
I want both the country

592
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,980
and my lover.

593
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,540
Lock this evil girl up.

594
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,660
Let me out.

595
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,940
Who are you to lock me up?

596
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,620
I didn't kill or rob anyone.

597
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,060
It's those eunuchs

598
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,940
who work for the Empress.

599
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Come out and take me on.

600
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,820
Stop yelling.

601
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,020
- You stupid ministers.
- The whole palace

602
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,220
is full of your voice.

603
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,380
Eat a steamed bun and shut up.

604
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,740
Are there more steamed buns?

605
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,660
And get me some water.

606
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,980
I got so thirsty after scolding
for a long time.

607
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,460
It's not like
they'll cut your head off tomorrow.

608
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,660
Do you have to eat that much?

609
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,980
Only when I'm full,
do I have the strength

610
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,780
to keep yelling at you.

611
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,300
Okay, okay. I'll get them for you.

612
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,220
Keeping her here for two more days,
we'll be poor.

613
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,060
She isn't going to destroy
our country like this, is she?

614
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,620
Let's go.

615
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,180
Hurry.

616
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,300
Here she is.

617
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,060
Hey.

618
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,100
What?

619
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,420
You came to laugh at me?

620
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,980
I need to warn you,

621
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,380
I have just built up my strength

622
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,460
and tried to find someone to scold now.

623
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,180
Look.

624
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,860
The prison meals
we have in Jixi are nutritious.

625
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,820
Not only did she not lose weight

626
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,260
but also gained some.

627
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,900
So what if I gained some weight?

628
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,620
I can stand steadily.

629
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,380
Not like you

630
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,980
who will be blown away by the wind.

631
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,260
When Zhuang Yanyang holds you,

632
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,900
it's like she's holding a big kite.

633
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,460
You...

634
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,060
Look at how she talks.

635
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,100
It seems she hasn't suffered much.

636
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,780
Come on.

637
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,220
If you guys want to laugh at me,
just come alone.

638
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,180
Why do you call everyone else here?

639
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,100
You are right.

640
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,420
We skipped class

641
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,860
just to make fun of you.

642
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,780
That's right.

643
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,580
You need to stand steadily.

644
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,260
So everyone can see

645
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,300
there's no difference

646
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,540
between you and us.

647
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
You don't look like an evil girl at all.

648
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,620
They're teasing you.

649
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,540
We are all here to visit you.

650
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,380
With your intelligence,
you and Pin can be a good match.

651
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,420
If you can't be the Crown Princess,

652
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,180
it's not bad to be the Eighth Princess.

653
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,700
Who are you talking about?

654
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,380
This rose gel is for your face.

655
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,260
Bad air here will make you age faster.

656
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,700
Thank you.

657
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,220
It's not that I feel bad for you.

658
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,980
I'm afraid if the Crown Princess
is someone old and ugly,

659
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,420
it'll be a shame
on our Chongwen Academy.

660
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,100
I bring you stinky tofu.

661
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,780
Just take it.

662
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
It stinks.

663
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,340
Thank you.

664
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,460
I was going to teach you a few moves

665
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,940
to take down the guards.

666
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,980
But it's too narrow here.

667
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,260
I can't move.

668
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,060
It's okay. I appreciate it.

669
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,060
What do you bring, Pin?

670
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,940
Me?

671
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,140
I have a question.

672
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,860
What question?

673
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,540
So are you Douzi or Mei?

674
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,540
Everyone.

675
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,780
We need to keep our voices down.

676
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,660
We're here for a secret prison visit.

677
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,060
It's not entertainment.

678
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,020
Yeah, yeah. Let's get out of here.

679
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,500
If they find out, we will be doomed.

680
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,500
Let's go.

681
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,140
Wait, you're already leaving?

682
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,340
Take good care of yourself.

683
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,380
We'll visit you another time.

684
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,060
Yes.

685
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,420
- Take care of yourself.
- Bye.

686
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,140
Let's go. Let's go.

687
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,740
Let's go.

688
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,500
Sorry, I made you suffer.

689
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,420
I miss you.

690
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,140
I miss you so much.

691
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,460
Me too.

692
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,820
I miss you day and night.

693
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,420
Locking me up in the Eastern Palace
for so long,

694
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,620
you hadn't come to see me.

695
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,860
When you finally came,

696
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,820
you spoke so ruthlessly.

697
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,540
Today in the hall,

698
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,500
I really thought
you were going to kill me.

699
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,060
My heart was broken.

700
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,500
It's my fault.

701
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,740
It will never happen again.

702
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,620
So what you said
in the hall still stands?

703
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
What was it again?

704
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,580
Getting married!

705
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,780
Forget it.

706
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,620
Of course, it stands.

707
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,700
Silly girl.

708
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,620
But I worry about that prophecy.

709
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,540
Don't you?

710
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,140
That hasn't happened yet.

711
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,340
We don't need to worry about it.

712
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,140
Let me take care of what's going on now.

713
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,180
Now you believe
that I won't hurt you, right?

714
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,420
Of course.

715
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,660
Yesterday when the ministers came
to the Eastern Palace to make trouble,

716
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,340
Dongxi left the palace

717
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
and did a background check
on you and your three fathers.

718
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,820
He is sure

719
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,100
that you didn't know who you were.

720
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,980
Did you send Dongxi to do so?

721
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,300
Of course, not.

722
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,980
Even if he didn't check,

723
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,380
I'll still believe you.

724
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,740
Besides,

725
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,580
I never doubted you.

726
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,860
I'm full of energy right now.

727
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,820
I just ate eight steamed buns.

728
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,820
I think I can still fight those monsters

729
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,260
for a few days.

730
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,540
I can't believe

731
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,460
you can still eat now.

732
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,660
Don't worry. You won't have to.

733
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,500
Just let me protect you.

734
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,540
By the way,
it's chaotic in the palace now.

735
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,620
I'd like to get you out
as soon as possible.

736
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,180
I'll pick you up
after I take care of everything.

737
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,380
I can still leave the palace now?

738
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,020
I'll arrange it secretly

739
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,420
by weakening the palace's defense

740
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,460
and getting you out of the palace.

741
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,380
Better sooner than later.

742
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,260
If everything goes well,

743
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,660
you can leave tomorrow night.

744
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,780
I can't stay here too long.

745
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
It'll cause suspicion.

746
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,260
Well... Then you better go.

747
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,940
Your clothes are dirty.

748
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,180
No.

749
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,460
I was wrong.

750
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,980
Let me straighten your clothes for you.

751
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,180
Done.

752
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,300
You may go now.

753
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,140
You don't want me to leave?

754
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,660
You didn't leave?

755
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,420
Be good.

756
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,540
After I take care of everything,

757
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,580
I'll come back for you.

758
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,140
