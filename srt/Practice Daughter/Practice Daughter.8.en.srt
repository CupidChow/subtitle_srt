185
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,260
Barrier Race?

186
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,500
Yes.

187
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,980
Barrier Race...

188
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,540
Mr. Bai!

189
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,580
Today is the day of our official race.

190
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,580
Through the training these days,

191
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,940
you've all made a lot of progress.

192
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,780
I hope you all take this race seriously.

193
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,540
Here are the rules.

194
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
In pairs,

195
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,940
one will do the archery.

196
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,540
After hitting the tenth ring,

197
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,500
the other sets out
and crosses the bridge.

198
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,980
Run around the field.

199
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,740
Then turn around three times.

200
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,620
Finally, jump on the rope net.

201
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,660
The team

202
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,860
that rings the bell
at the top of the net first wins.

203
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,620
Now let's practice.

204
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Now let's practice.

205
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,700
Your Highness.

206
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,660
This bow is too heavy for me.

207
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,300
Your Highness, could you please

208
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,020
teach me how to use it?

209
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,380
You have no strength. Don't push it.

210
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,620
Go to the Imperial Physician

211
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,900
and get some pills later.

212
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,260
Exactly, you need pills.

213
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,540
Oh no. No.

214
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,420
Xing is going to give me hell.

215
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,860
I am sorry. I am really sorry.

216
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,460
Xing, you are handsome and kind.

217
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,260
I'm sure you won't blame me, will you?

218
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,780
You're such a bad archer.

219
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,500
Now you will learn how to shoot
with the Crown Prince.

220
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,780
Why?

221
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,100
Exactly.

222
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,700
She is so bad at it.

223
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,820
Why do you ask the Crown Prince
to teach her, not us?

224
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,100
No specific reasons.

225
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,660
You didn't shoot me.

226
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,580
I...

227
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,180
Consider it something
I do for my own safety.

228
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,620
I don't want to die this young.

229
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,780
Again.

230
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,620
Left hand for the target.

231
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,660
I don't believe it.

232
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,740
Look.

233
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,820
Keep your feet shoulder-width apart.

234
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,940
There.

235
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,740
- A bit to the left.
- Put your core evenly

236
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,860
between your legs.

237
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,420
You see?

238
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,420
Whatever I aim at, I miss it.

239
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,620
So should I

240
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,980
aim at something else to get it right?

241
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,460
For example,

242
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,060
I want to shoot Eighth Prince.

243
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,500
One more.

244
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,140
I should aim at the eunuch next to him.

245
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,060
If my target
is Su Ruomei's servant girl,

246
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,220
I should aim
at Huang Yuanyuan's servant girl.

247
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,420
So if I try to hit the tenth ring,

248
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,980
I have to aim at Xing.

249
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,460
Little Master, what do you think?

250
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,900
Nonsense.

251
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,140
I see that you're best
at making nonsense.

252
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,460
Come on.

253
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,100
No one can do it.

254
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,780
I'll teach you.

255
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,460
Not always.

256
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,100
I'll show you next.

257
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Shoulders relaxed.

258
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,900
Target confirmed.

259
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,460
Hold your breath.

260
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,980
Little Master,

261
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,900
do we shoot now?

262
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,980
If our team wins later,

263
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,340
what reward do I get?

264
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,580
If I win, you win as well.

265
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,020
Release.

266
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,420
Go on.

267
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,940
Right.

268
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,860
So close.

269
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,780
Good job.

270
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,260
Huge progress.

271
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,940
I told you

272
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
a bit higher.

273
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,220
What's wrong?

274
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,140
Look at her.

275
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,100
Like the most annoying glue.

276
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,260
Always stay by the side
of the Crown Prince.

277
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Exactly.

278
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,100
She is a bigger faker than me.

279
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,700
I wonder where she learned that.

280
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,980
Let go.

281
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,380
Go.

282
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,940
Watch this.

283
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,980
Mr. Bai, you were walking so fast.

284
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,700
Mr. Bai?

285
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,940
My hand shook.

286
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,220
Look in that direction.

287
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Remember what I taught you.

288
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,300
Don't make our team lose.

289
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Practice over.

290
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,460
Now the race begins.

291
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,700
Thanks, Your Highness.

292
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,860
Here.

293
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,380
Oh, yes, Little Master.

294
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,340
I got it.

295
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,820
Mei Yushan cheated.

296
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,860
We all saw it.

297
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,980
The Crown Prince shot the arrow for her.

298
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,340
Right.

299
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,780
The Crown Prince shot the arrow.

300
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,420
So Miss Mei should go for the bell.

301
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,540
Yes. We agree.

302
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,140
Yeah, the bell. The bell.

303
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,740
Go for the bell.

304
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,260
I'll go for the bell.

305
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,220
Now I announce,

306
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,380
Su Ruomei, Huang Yuanyuan and Mei Yushan

307
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,660
got into the second round today.

308
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,300
Everyone else could hit the target.

309
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,260
Why couldn't you?

310
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
I tried my best.

311
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,020
You saw what happened.

312
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,660
It was this close.

313
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,420
The race begins.

314
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,620
Come on.

315
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Hurry. You are close.

316
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Almost there.

317
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,980
Look at Miss Mei.

318
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,580
Go, Miss Mei.

319
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,260
Come on.

320
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm not giving up.

321
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,620
Little Master,

322
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,260
we won.

323
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,100
It got me worried.

324
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,980
Luckily we have the Crown Prince.

325
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,820
When the rope went wrong,

326
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,580
he went for it without hesitation.

327
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,460
His Highness was born kind and helpful.

328
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,220
He and Little Bean
are classmates after all.

329
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,500
It's natural for him to help her.

330
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,860
The hiring is all done.

331
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,980
Men went to the countryside
to build barracks.

332
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,740
Women and children went
to make clothes and silk.

333
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,420
I heard.

334
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,020
You did a good job of it.

335
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,540
I'm glad that I could help you.

336
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,580
You seem not to be in a good mood today.

337
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,780
What's wrong? You can tell me.

338
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,860
I can help however I may.

339
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,740
I don't have much to worry about.

340
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,260
However, the Empress

341
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,540
has mentioned
your future wife several times.

342
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,460
I wonder
if you have someone in mind now.

343
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,220
So tiring.

344
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,340
This place is full of ladies these days.

345
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,900
Come on.

346
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,980
Your Highness,

347
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,620
I hope you know which one to marry.

348
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,700
Stop it.

349
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
You know exactly

350
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,820
why I came back to Chongwen Pavillion.

351
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,140
No way.

352
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,180
How scary that was.

353
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,100
Yeah.

354
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,700
Little Master,

355
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,340
we won.

356
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,860
All women

357
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,460
should learn to behave yourselves first.

358
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,260
- The most important is
- Draw it.

359
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,220
to be loyal and chaste.

360
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,460
Over there.

361
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,420
Being loyal makes you decent.

362
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,260
Being chaste makes you proud.

363
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,980
Hurry.

364
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,860
Draw it on her.

365
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,220
Do not turn back when walking.

366
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,500
- Do not lift lips when talking.
- Draw a turtle.

367
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,020
Who knows? Look.

368
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,660
Come on, draw it.

369
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,620
Do not move knees while sitting.

370
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,420
Do not shake dresses while standing.

371
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,660
Do not laugh while pleased.

372
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,900
Do not raise voice while angry.

373
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,740
Su Ruomei, what did you draw on my face?

374
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,100
So noisy in the class.
Where's your manner?

375
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,980
Grand Tutor,

376
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,020
she drew something on my face.

377
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,340
Do not laugh while pleased.

378
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,580
Do not raise voice while angry.

379
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,460
You influenced the class.

380
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,700
Copy the Analects For Women ten times.

381
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,220
I...

382
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,820
Grand Tutor,

383
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,420
I don't agree with what you just said.

384
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,660
Do not laugh while pleased.

385
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,780
Do not raise voice while angry.

386
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,700
Is she crazy?

387
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,860
Openly contradicting Grand Tutor
in the classroom.

388
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,500
How could she...

389
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,100
Exactly.

390
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,820
There's nothing she wouldn't dare do.

391
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,860
Yeah.

392
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,620
Oh? What do you think then?

393
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,540
Tell me about it.

394
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,900
There are joys and sorrows in life.

395
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,500
We should laugh when pleased.

396
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,100
Giving fake smiles sounds vicious.

397
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,340
Think about it.

398
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,700
If you're watching a show,

399
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,820
and no one is laughing.

400
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,020
How disappointed the actors would be?

401
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,900
That's nonsense.

402
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,980
That sounds fair.

403
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,300
Although it's nonsense,

404
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,580
it's a good example.

405
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,660
Besides,

406
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,780
my teeth are too white to not laugh.

407
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,100
But I have one more question.

408
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,180
What if she has buck teeth?

409
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,820
Should she laugh or not?

410
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,940
So much being said.

411
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,660
So should women laugh or not?

412
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,140
Should we just laugh

413
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,500
or cover our mouths and smile?

414
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,180
Well,

415
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,740
we have to ask the Grand Tutor.

416
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,780
What Miss Mei said

417
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,820
does make some sense.

418
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,260
Mei Yushan,

419
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,780
thanks for helping me out in class.

420
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,660
I just said what I wanted to say.

421
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,540
Well, thank you all the same.

422
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,820
If it weren't for you,

423
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,300
I'd have tons of books to copy.

424
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,500
So next time someone draws

425
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,740
on your face,

426
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,140
you should push her away.

427
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,180
Otherwise, all your martial arts
would be wasted.

428
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,940
But,

429
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,660
my mother always says I'm too rude.

430
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,660
What's wrong with being rude?

431
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,940
It's called an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

432
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,860
Thank you.

433
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,380
It's just an apple.

434
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,180
You're not going to criticise me again,
are you?

435
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,820
I heard what you just said
to the Grand Tutor

436
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,700
in the classroom.

437
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,140
What?

438
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,660
You're going to lecture me again?

439
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,620
I was always educated

440
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,820
to hide my joy and anger.

441
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,100
People praise me for being well-behaved

442
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,820
as the daughter of the Grand Chancellor.

443
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,300
But I don't want that.

444
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,580
I also wish I could live as I want to.

445
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,100
Mei Daidai,

446
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,500
you make me feel like

447
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,980
that you have changed a bit.

448
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,620
I...

449
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,380
Refuse food that has been touched.

450
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,900
Eat it.

451
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,460
Let's go.

452
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,740
[Guixiu Pavilion]

453
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,700
Have you heard?

454
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,540
We're going hunting
the day after tomorrow.

455
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,860
Sounds so exciting.

456
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,340
Is it time

457
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,140
to shoot the wolves and tigers?

458
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,220
Maybe

459
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,940
the Crown Prince will face some danger

460
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,580
and will need me to protect him.

461
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,540
Someone like you

462
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,020
can only shoot wolves and tigers.

463
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,140
Do we shoot any differently?

464
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,860
Of course, it's different.

465
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,740
My arrow

466
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,660
is going to land on someone's heart.

467
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,220
His Highness will need me.

468
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,740
Don't get too excited just yet.

469
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,140
Don't forget

470
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,900
that Mei Yushan is also coming that day.

471
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,180
The Crown Prince has been
treating her differently lately.

472
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,100
It's still daytime,

473
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,180
who misses me so much?

474
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,540
No one misses you.

475
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,100
We are talking about the hunting.

476
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,940
Hunting?

477
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,380
Hunting what?

478
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,780
Animals, of course.

479
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,100
Either sheep or deer.

480
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
We won't

481
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,540
hunt down the pastry
in your hand for sure.

482
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,180
Wait, when did the deers and lambs

483
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,620
ever offend you?

484
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,660
They are just living their lives.

485
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,900
Why will you hunt them?

486
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,180
Exactly.

487
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,420
Let me tell you something.

488
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,580
Hunting is a traditional sport.

489
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,060
All we have to do is stick to it.

490
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,140
What kind of tradition is that?

491
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,180
So savage.

492
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
What do you know?

493
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,580
Hunting is an advanced hobby.

494
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,940
Besides,

495
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,100
those animals will die either way.

496
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,900
Nonsense.

497
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,220
You will die as well.

498
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,300
How dare you talk back to me?

499
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,900
I might report this to Eunuch Song.

500
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,700
Give her a lesson.

501
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,220
Do you think
Eunuch Song is as boring as you are?

502
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,420
He doesn't have time for your nonsense.

503
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,180
What are you still doing here?

504
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,380
Go find Eunuch Song.

505
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,020
What now?

506
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,780
Mei Daidai,

507
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,540
did you hear them
talk about hunting today?

508
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,620
Hunting is an annual event
in the palace.

509
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,700
For entertainment.

510
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,300
Not just Chongwen Pavillion.

511
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,940
Other princes and nobles

512
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,260
will be there as well.

513
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,860
I guess they just want to take you
to practice this time.

514
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,500
But nothing new.

515
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,740
For as long as I can remember,

516
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,420
the winner has always
been the Crown Prince.

517
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,020
The Crown Prince?

518
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,580
You want to attend it?

519
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,740
I would love to go there.

520
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,780
But I don't want to see

521
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,860
those poor animals being shot to death.

522
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,660
Little Bean,

523
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,340
do you think

524
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,020
that you are acting weird lately?

525
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,940
Weird how?

526
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,060
When we first entered the palace,

527
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,940
you talked about Moon Spirit Pearl
every day.

528
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,300
You haven't talked about it much lately.

529
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,220
Instead, you're concerned
about the Academy.

530
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,500
No way.

531
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,300
In my mind,

532
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,340
I'm always
thinking about Moon Spirit Pearl.

533
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,260
Well...

534
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,580
Although I see Little Master every day,

535
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,500
he's just too alert.

536
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,860
And the Eastern Palace
is so heavily guarded.

537
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,180
I can't get the pearl that easily.

538
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,540
I see you having fun

539
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,940
at school every day.

540
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,140
Calling him Little Master all the time.

541
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,020
So?

542
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,500
You don't want us to switch back?

543
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,660
Mei Daidai,

544
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,860
when did you ever see me having fun?

545
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,300
Well,

546
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,220
I have to let him trust me first.

547
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,860
How am I supposed
to get the pearl otherwise?

548
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,940
I just hope you know what you're doing.

549
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,820
What is this?

550
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,940
Mr. Bai sent this to you.

551
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,140
Protect your hands during hunting.

552
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,660
Mr. Bai cares a lot about you.

553
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,660
Gloves.

554
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,460
If only

555
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,020
these gloves are not for hunting.

556
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,340
I'm sure I'd love them.

557
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,540
Really nice.

558
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,500
Hold these for me.

559
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,940

People who are obsessed
with killing poor animals

604

Let's go, Miss Mei.

618
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,540
It turns out Miss Mei wanted me
to walk her home

619
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,700
so that I can get the medicine for you.

620
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,820
She also said

621

she got this medicine from her father.

It may look bad.

623

But once you apply this cream

on your wounded leg,

625
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,100
just in a day or two, you'll be better.

But I wonder,

00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,820
since Miss Mei grew up
in the Grand Chancellor's Residence,

about food or anything,

631
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,740
why she would even know that.

632
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,220
Yeah, I also think

633
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,460
that she does not have

634
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,700
any smugness of a young lady.

635
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,500
Instead, she is casual, free

and clever.
