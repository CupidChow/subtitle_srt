00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,380
Good morning, sir.

141
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,500
Sit down, everyone.

142
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,340
All of you are either princes
or noble ladies.

143
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,220
When you become rulers or ministers
in the future,

144
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,140
you need to participate
in making decrees.

145
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,420
Therefore, understanding legal texts
from ancient books

146
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,580
will be a mandatory course
starting today.

147
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,460
The sage's laws

148
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,460
must be plain, easy to learn,
rightly named.

149
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,700
dawning on both the foolish
and the wise.

150
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,420
Thus, appoint judges

151
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,260
and legal officers in charge of the law

152
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,260
as instructors to all,

153
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,980
lest the people fall into peril.

154
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,980
That means you must make laws

155
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,540
easy to understand

156
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,060
so that both the foolish and the wise
can grasp them at a glance.

157
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,340
Laws are the lifeblood of the people,

158
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,940
the very foundation of governance

159
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,460
to prepare the people.

160
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,740
Discarding laws to govern

161
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,620
is like forgoing food to avoid hunger,

162
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,100
removing clothes to avoid cold,

163
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,140
or going west for the east.

164
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,500
The folly of such endeavors
is self-evident.

165
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
The class is over?

166
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,460

168
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,220
Well...

169
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,460
I can tell that

170
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,660
my speech has been rather dull.

171
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,100
I ask for your patience
and understanding.

172
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,220
Well, then!

173
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,900

make no distinction

179

based on intimacy or status,

180
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,060
with the same standard of law.

181
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,020
One day,

182

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,580
about a murder from three years ago

185
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,820
that astounded Li Kui.

186
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,540
Why?

187
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,420
Because this murder case
from three years ago

188
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,060
had been closed by him.

189
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,900
But due to his misjudgment,

190
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,020
an innocent man had been executed.

191
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,660
According to the legal principle
set by Li Kui himself,

192
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,100
that was a capital offense.

193
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,100
Therefore,

194
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,460
sticking

195
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,300
to the legal principle set by himself,

196
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,100
Li Kui wrote a suicide note.

197
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,700
He committed suicide!

198
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,500
Is that a true story?

199
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,060
Sir...

200
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,660
Did he really kill himself?

201
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,300
I have a question.

202
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,180
Is this legal code definitely correct?

203
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,540
Yeah...

204
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,140
She has a point.

205
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,700
The code is also made by people.

206
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,580
Is it absolutely correct?

207
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,140
- It can also be wrong.
- How can we explain this?

208
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,740
He was killed by the laws
made by himself.

209
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,500
Yeah...

210
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,220
Well...

211
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,580
Why do you ask so?

212
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,140
I just doubt what the book says.

213
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,700
Wrong words can be corrected,

214
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,940
but a dead man doesn't have
a second chance.

215
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,500
This is an interesting point of view.

216
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,540
Yeah, that makes sense.

217
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,220
Well...

218
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,060
Is Li Kui's tragedy inevitable?

219
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,020
Men live and eat

220
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,380
as worldly beings with emotions.

221
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,460
Even the most virtuous person

222
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,140
can be selfish sometimes.

223
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,260
Letting an individual make the law

224
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,260
will inevitably result in issues.

225
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,220
That's true.

226
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
Brother Yao stood up.

227
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,420
Since the law is applied to the people,

228
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,620
it should come from the people.

229
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,620
Only by gathering the wisdom
of the masses

230
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,500
can we make the perfect code.

231
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,340
Exactly!

232
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,660
Use it carefully
and constantly refine the code.

233
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,020
This is what

234
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,340
I want to teach today.

235
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,580
Stop it!

236
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,740
A quarter past Si hour.

237
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,300
Time for the etiquette class!

238
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,420
Let's go...

239
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,060
What a nice figure...

240
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,700
Greetings, Madam Liu.

241
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,540
[Madam Liu]

242
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
[Madam Liu]
Let's begin the class.

243
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm Liu Jiao,
the Secretary of the Ministry of Rites,

244
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,420
also known as Madam Liu.

245
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,300
By the order of the Empress,

246
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,100
I came to the Chongwen Pavilion
to teach you etiquette.

247
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,420
This subject is intended
to let the princes and ladies understand

248
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,900
the significance of etiquette.

249
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,460
In today's lesson,

250
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,300
we need to learn about composure,

251
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,060
a very important concept in etiquette.

252
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,500
Princes and ladies,
please line up in two rows.

253
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,660
The so-called composure

254
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
means no matter what happens
in front of you,

255
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,500
you should hide all your emotions
from others.

256
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,700
Let's practice anti-disturbance ability
in groups.

257
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,540
Do whatever you can to either amuse
or intimidate each other.

258
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,340
Those who can keep an unchanged face
for thirty breaths

259
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,180
will pass the test.

260
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,940
This test concerns the pride
of the imperial man.

261
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,260
Must guarantee success,

262
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,380
no failure!

263
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Give me back the pearl!

264
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,100
Or I'll surely emerge victorious!

265
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,100
In your dreams.

266
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,420
Start!

267
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,140
Your Highness,

268
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,020
please begin your performance.

269
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,540
You can make it, Your Highness!

270
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,460
Go for it!

271
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,460
Come on!

272
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,980
- Come on!
- Brother Yao,

273
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,020
- I believe in you, Your Highness!
- you can do it!

274
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,860
Start!

275
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
I'm done performing.

276
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,020
Then I guess it's my turn.

277
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,220
You can't win.

278
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,780
Come on!

279
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,420
Hold on, Your Highness!

280
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,220
Go for it!

281
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,740
Come on!

282
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,380
His Highness is so handsome!

283
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,860
- His Highness is so handsome.
- His Highness will win for sure!

284
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,420
Still that poker face?

285
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,860
You can make it, Your Highness...

286
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,860
I give up.

287
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,180
[Win/Lose]
His Highness won!

288
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,660
Even that couldn't make you laugh?

289
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,340
Awesome!

290
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,940
Tomorrow, a quarter past Shen hour,

291
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,700
it's the Chongwen Pavilion's
Entrance Examination.

292
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,980
It coincides with the visit
of ambassadors from a friendly state.

293
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,900
Their Princess An is also with them
on the trip to Jixi.

294
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,660
Hearing about the entrance examination
held by the Chongwen Pavilion,

295
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,940
she decided to come to take it too
and compete with you.

296
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,860
Please take it seriously
and do your best on the exam.

297
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,060
Your writing must be clear,

298
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
with no answers left blank.

299
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,700
Anyone who makes random answers

300
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,780
will receive a heavy penalty.

301
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,620
What?
Why can't we leave any answers blank?

302
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,460
And there's a heavy penalty!

303
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,980
They can't punish Princess An!

304
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,300
Is it that legendary young princess
from the friendly state,

305
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,500
known for her perfect singing, dancing,
wisdom, and diligence?

306
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,180
Exactly.

307
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,500
It's said she's so intelligent.

308
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,100
What can we do?

309
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,220
No one in her state can be her teacher.

310
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
Why did she come to compete with us?

311
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,980
Is she coming to make trouble?

312
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,900
Hold on! You said "heavy penalty".

313
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
What's that?

314
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,020
Why do you even have a penalty
for an exam here?

315
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,780
What? Are you scared?

316
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,100
No, I'm not!

317
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
Are you sure you can win?

318
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,660
[The Next Day, Chongwen Pavilion]

319
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,020
Here comes Princess An!

320
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,780
So she's that princess!

321
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,780
That's Princess An?

322
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,060
You go talk to her!

323
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,220
You go...

324
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,380
- I'm not doing it...
- Just go!

325
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,980
Greetings, Princess An.

326
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,260
[Princess An]
I've heard you're very knowledgeable.

327
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,050
[Princess An]

328
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,460
We are going to have
the entrance examination today.

329
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,500
If you fail,

330
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,180
all of us will be punished!

331
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,220
You have to help us!

332
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,300
Princess An,

333
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,060
I've heard a lot
about your capabilities.

334
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,540
We really need your help.

335
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,940
Yes, Princess!

336
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,940
We don't want to be punished.

337
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,140
Neither do we want to lose
to that newcomer, Mei Yushan.

338
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,660
Please do us a favor!

339
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,260
Don't you

340
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,140
spend any time studying?

341
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,580
What's the use of cramming
at the last minute?

342
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,860
I can't help you with that.

343
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,460
The entrance examination begins now.

344
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,340
Five papers for each of you.

345
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
One question per paper.

346
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Unlimited ways to answer questions.

347
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,700
The assessment is decided
by the Grand Tutor.

348
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,060
The exam begins!

349
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,660
Answer by yourself.

350
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,580
What?

351
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,780
No peeking!

352
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,540
Let me take a look.

353
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,900
- No.
- Don't show her.

354
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,940
Mei...

355
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,820
I finished the papers, sir.

356
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,940
That's so fast!

357
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,820
Yeah...

358
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,020
You finished it so quickly,
Your Highness!

359
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,660
Miss Mei, it's been a while,

360
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,700
yet you haven't even finished
a single question?

361
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,660
These questions are too simple for me.

362
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,740
Not interesting at all.

363
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,980
Miss Mei, given the fame
for your talent,

364
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,260
are you going to hand in blank papers
for the first entrance examination

365
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,580
No way!

366
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,500
I'm writing my answers.

367
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,140
It's no big deal for me!

368
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,260
My answers are not necessarily inferior
to yours!

369
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,140
The Crown Prince answered
with grandeur and rigor,

370
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,980
showing the demeanor
of a future emperor.

371
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,900
He can be a role model
for all the students.

372
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,740
And Princess An's answers

373
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,180
are unique.

374
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,700
I can't assert that no one in the future
can do it the same way.

375
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,620
But they're definitely unprecedented.

376
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,820
I should learn from her.

377
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,180
That awesome?

378
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,300
Incredible!

379
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm flattered.

380
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,020
I don't think I'm doing my best
this time.

381
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,020
If I weren't leaving
in a couple of days,

382
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,980
I'd really like to take a test again
with everyone.

383
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,580
Don't bother...

384
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,500
Ladies are first-time enrollees.

385
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,740
Uneven performance is inevitable.

386
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,980
We won't be hard on you.

387
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,420
Where are Mei Yufan's answer sheets?

388
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,020
She didn't finish them, did she?

389
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,620
I have long heard about the talent
of Grand Chancellor Mei's daughter.

390
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,580
Today, let me witness her brilliance.

391
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,020
What's wrong

392
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,700
Read it. I'm listening.

393
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,740
- Why don't you read it?
- Yeah!

394
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,860
- Read it!
- Come on!

395
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,700
- Why don't you read it?
- Just go ahead.

396
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,380
Question One.

397
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,340
The Peach Blossom Spring
is a thousand feet deep,

398
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,060
but not as deep
as Wang Lun's affection for me.

399
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,700
Who is Wang Lun?

400
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,980
Your Highness,

401
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,980
you read it.

402
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,900
[Did Wang Lun jump off the cliff?]

403
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,540
Did Wang Lun...

404
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,300
Jump off the cliff?

405
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,900
Jump...

406
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,420
Jump off the cliff...

407
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,860
She doesn't even know who Wang Lun is!

408
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,180
I really know nothing about Wang Lun!

409
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,140
Is he famous?

410
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,220
Why did he jump off the cliff?

411
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,260
And why is there a poem,
The Peach Blossom Spring, in his memory?

412
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,180
Just one question. It's nothing.

413
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,860
Let's see the next question!

414
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Question Two.

415
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,580
The couple used to be
birds of a feather,

416
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,220
yet they flew separately
in the face of disaster.

417
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,540
Why did it become a famous line
in the storybook?

418
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,420
[You two are a perfect match.]

419
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,500
- You two
- What the heck is this?

420
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,460
are a perfect match.

421
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,620
You two are a perfect match.

422
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,900
I know this one!

423
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,620
Neither of the couple was a good guy.

424
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,540
They flew separately
in the face of disaster.

425
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,020
In our language,

426
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,460
they were not faithful at all!

427
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,060
That's why I call them a perfect match!

428
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,980
What nonsense are you talking about?

429
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,580
Question Three.

430
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,100
I invite you to drink
another cup of wine.

431
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,780
West of the Sunny Pass
no friends will be seen.

432
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,620
What kind of mood is expressed?

433
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,420
So mean...

434
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,540
- Mean?
- So mean...

435
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,580
She's such a freak!

436
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,420
Question Four.

437
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,340
If my friends in the North
should ask if I'm all right;

438
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,140
my skiff has left
ten thousand mountains away.

439
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,380
Which two poems are these lines from?

440
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,100
What?

441
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,220
What's her answer?

442
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,620
- What did she write?
- I can't see.

443
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,140
Did he owe someone money?

444
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,820
He ran so fast!

445
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,860
That's so ridiculous!

446
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,660
Sir!

447
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,060
Physician!

448
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,180
Fetch the imperial physician!

449
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,820
Sir!

450
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,940
Sir! Are you alright, sir?

451
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,540
Sir...

452
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,660
Are you okay, sir?

453
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,700
Sir! Are you alright, sir?

454
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,580
How do you feel, sir?

455
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,020
Are you alright?

456
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,740
Sir...

457
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,940
How are you feeling, sir?

458
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,100
Mr. Zhou is quite good at treatment.

459
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,900
But he doesn't usually show it.

460
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,380
The physicians in the imperial palace
are actually no match for him.

461
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,060
Just let him handle it himself.

462
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,940
That's so amazing...

463
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,500
- Sir...
- What is he doing?

464
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,020
Sir?

465
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,180
What's wrong?

466
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,620
- Amazing!
- He's alright!

467
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,420
He's come around!

468
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,380
Glad to see you alright!

469
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,420
- That's incredible.
- He's fine.

470
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,460
Unbelievable!

471
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,820
[Xingqing Hall]
The Grand Chancellor's daughter,

472
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,220
[Xingqing Hall]
Mei Yushan misbehaved at the academy

473
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,620
and disrupted the examination order.

474
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,300
The Grand Tutor punished her
to copy books every day after class.

475
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,420
And hand it over to me...

476
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,660
Hand it over

477
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,700
to the Crown Prince for inspection.

478
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,420
The punishment will last half a month.

479
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,580
It's time for dinner, Your Highness!

480
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,060
Shall we have dinner?

481
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,060
I'm not hungry. Keep copying.

482
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,620
I finished copying!

483
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,860
So fast.

484
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,860
It's not only full of typos...

485
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,580
That's the root
of the Later Han's decline.

486
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,300
It should be followed by

487
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,420
"The Late Emperor

488
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,460
often discussed these topics with me..."

489
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
But why did you miss this part
and skip to

490
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,500
"The Late Emperor did not despise me
for my background.

491
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,380
He humbled himself..."

492
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Did I miss this part?

493
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,780
Maybe I made this mistake
because they both start

494
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
with "The Late Emperor".

495
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,260
You missed more than this part.

496
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,380
"The Late Emperor knew my prudence,

497
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,220
so before he passed away,

498
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,540
he entrusted me with his great cause."

499
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,180
You missed this, too.

500
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,820
You continued with

501
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,660
"It is my duty to repay
the Late Emperor's kindness

502
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,620
and prove my loyalty to Your Majesty."

503
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,300
I couldn't see clearly.

504
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,260
It's getting dark.

505
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,300
And my stomach is grumbling.

506
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
Everyone is resting!

507
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,300
Why so serious?

508
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,180
Do you think I want to

509
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,380
stay here and see you copy books?

510
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,020
Then let's go have dinner?

511
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,700
Recopy it.

512
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,010
[Imperial City]

513
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,500
It's three-quarters past Mao hour.

514
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,620
If there are still errors or omissions,

515
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,180
you should recopy again.

516
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,340
Recopy.

517
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,380
He knew which one
I was going to copy yesterday.

518
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,100
So he must have secretly prepared

519
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,340
to pick at me on purpose.

520
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,020
Let's see if you can still gloat today!

521
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Free and Easy Wandering?

522
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,540
You didn't copy On Yueyang Tower?

523
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,180
Did I copy the wrong work?

524
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,300
I remember the Grand Tutor
asked me to copy

525
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,460
this one.

526
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,180
Never mind.

527
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,420
Free and Easy Wandering can also do.

528
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,580
The mushroom of a morning knows not
the alternation of day and night.

529
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,980
The chrysalis knows not
the alternation of spring and autumn.

530
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,420
Why is it followed by
"The perfect man ignores self;

531
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,140
the divine man ignores action;
the true Sage ignores reputation."

532
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,300
D-did I miss copying something again?

533
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
No way!

534
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
Besides,

535
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,020
you've missed

536
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,540
278 words

537
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,020
and misspelled 82 words.

538
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,780
You even know how many words
I've missed?

539
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,700
Sure.

540
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,540
I don't believe it.

541
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,420
Are you sure it's 275 words?

542
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,980
Does one more or one less character

543
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,900
count as your failure?

544
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,620
Sure.

545
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,500
Then, if you lose,

546
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,220
you should give me back
the Moon Spirit Pearl!

547
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,220
Deal.

548
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,020
What if I win?

549
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
If you win,

550
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
I'll admit you're awesome.

551
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,060
You can be my teacher.

552
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,540
It's really 275!

553
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,140
You...

554
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,900
How did you know that?

555
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Recopy.

556
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,500
Did you copy it backward from the end?

557
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,140
Yes, Your Highness, my little master.

558
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,020
Now you can do nothing, huh?

559
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,580
I don't believe you can check
in reverse!

560
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,900
132 words missing.

561
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,740
27 words misspelled.

562
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
Mainly in that paragraph,
from "To go up this tower

563
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,660
is to find inner peace

564
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,980
and to forget both praise and curse"

565
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,660
to "embracing distant mountains
and swallowing the mighty Yangtze River,

566
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,860
rolling on and on."

567
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,420
Recopy.

568
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,900
Recopy!

569
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,340
Recopy.

570
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,660
Recopy!

571
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,820
Recopy.

572
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,980
Hurry...

573
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,740
Get changed and leave the palace...

574
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,340
Little Bean.

575
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,580
Others enjoy a life of abundance
as noble ladies,

576
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,820
while I have to read every day

577
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,020
with my stomach grumbling all the time.

578
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,540
So painful!

579
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,740
Little Bean's hands are quite agile!

580
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,780
Little Bean!

581
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,100
Little Master, please check it.

582
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,580
Quiet!

583
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,500
Is it for me?

584
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,500
Obviously.

585
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,940
Do you hate me so much these days?

586
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
No!

587
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,140
My little master is excellent
and knowledgeable

588
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,420
like a living encyclopedia!

589
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,060
And you gave me a baked sweet potato!

590
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,420
I like you!

591
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,420
Flattery.

592
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,140
You can go back.

593
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,900
No more recopying?

594
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,460
Not a word misspelled,
not a word missing.

595
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,820
Why should you recopy?

596
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,900
Little master, that's so nice of you!

597
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,540
I'm sorry for that, Your Highness.

598
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,820
When there's no one around,

599
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,460
you don't need to call me that way.

600
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,860
Yes, little master.

601
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,580
No dining etiquette...

602
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,260
Sanctimonious little master.

603
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,860
You harassed your female student
in the study!

604
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,860
I'm taking my leave!

605
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,860
Who taught you that?

606
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,900
My first teacher
is even better than you!

607
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,820
Who's it?

608
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,020
The toothless old storyteller
on Xuanwu Street!

609
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,020
