that has been keeping my Yao there.

183
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,900
[Workers Wanted]

184
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
Hiring is not going well?

185
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,460
Someone tries to
talk the refugees out of working

186
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,620
and into demanding reparations
from the Imperial Court.

187
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,020
So they led the problem
back to you again.

188
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,500
I've gotten used to it over the years.

189
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,020
Any natural or man-made problems
can be my problems.

190
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,060
So are those shiftless losers.

191
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,940
They're waiting for me to show up.

192
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,860
And then they can make things worse.

193
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,220
Bai Ye.

194
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,900
- You...
- Your Highness,

195
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
let me take care of the hiring.

196
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,060
You?

197
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,260
That's right.
We can't give them what they want.

198
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,700
I'd like to fix this for you.

199
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,460
I'll let you do the hiring then.

200
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,860
Miss Mei.

201
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,460
Aren't you the Crown Prince's guard?

202
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,900
What are you doing here?

203
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,140
My name is Xing Shi.

204
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,100
Last year in the physical competition,

205
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,460
I won the first place by accident.

206
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,940
So I was sent to Chongwen Pavillion

207
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,980
to teach martial arts
to the princes and ladies.

208
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,980
Well, thank you for your hard work.

209
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,540
Miss Mei, where are you going?

210
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,780
I need to use the restroom.

211
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,500
That happens.

212
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,940
Please inform the Grand Tutor for me.

213
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,740
Miss Mei,

214
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,180
that way.

215
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,220
Little Master.

216
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,220
What was that sound you just made?

217
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,980
You don't know it?

218
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,140
Of... Of course, I know.

219
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,060
I thought you needed the restroom.

220
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,060
Or were you just trying to skip classes?

221
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,700
I...

222
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,700
I am much better now.

223
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,500
I'm just hanging out here.

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,540
I came across this leaf.

225
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,100
You know this?

226
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,140
Who taught you?

227
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
Oh, my father.

228
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,340
The Grand Chancellor
also knows about farming?

229
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,420
He's the Grand Chancellor.

230
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,100
He should
know a little about everything.

231
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,500
What's the matter, Little Master?

232
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,620
You want to learn this?

233
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,100
How hard can it be?

234
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
It seems pretty simple.

235
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,860
Then watch carefully.

236
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,340
Pick one that's thin

237
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,860
and firm.

238
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,700
Like this one.

239
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,340
Hold it with your hands
and put it on your lips.

240
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,380
Then blow.

241
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,940
You sound like farting.

242
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,420
It's the first time
the ladies coming into the palace.

243
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,820
No wonder they are a bit reserved.

244
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,780
But they're ladies after all.

245
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,140
No trouble has been caused.

246
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,500
However...

247
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,420
What?

248
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,820
As soon as Miss Mei
came to Chongwen Pavillion,

249
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,660
she was punished

250
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,460
to copy books for half a month.

251
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,900
Miss Mei.

252
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,140
A gentle and dignified girl.

253
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,620
Knowledgeable and reasonable.

254
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,660
I quite like her.

255
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,060
Her servant girl is also very talented.

256
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,620
Her paintings are very vivid.

257
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,940
Family Mei knows how to educate a lady.

258
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,700
She's punished
in the Chongwen Pavillion.

259
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Eunuch Song,

260
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,220
tell the Royal Pantry

261
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,180
to prepare some supplements

262
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,260
specially for her.

263
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

264
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,180
You are never wrong about anyone.

265
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Look at you.

266
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,460
You...

267
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,460
Why are you farting in your mouth?

268
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Don't be rude.

269
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,940
You'll make people think

270
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,820
that you have a bad digestive system.

271
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,220
Do it again.

272
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,940
Don't laugh.

273
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,500
Little Master, a cat.

274
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,980
Where? Where is the cat?

275
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,980
Where is it?

276
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,060
Where is the cat?

277
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,020
You're teasing me, aren't you?

278
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,460
You...

279
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,820
It seems
I underestimated this Mei Yushan.

280
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,140
The Crown Prince
has always been well-behaved.

281
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,180
He has never...

282
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,180
How improper.

283
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,260
She makes my son so frivolous.

284
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,980
Don't you run away.

285
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,580
You can also do martial arts?

286
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,540
I was just kidding.

287
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,220
Little Master, don't be mad.

288
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,180
What else do you know

289
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,660
and I haven't found out?

290
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,540
A lot of things.

291
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,020
I'll tell you
if you give the pearl back.

292
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,620
If you don't give it back,

293
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,500
I'll get going.

294
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,300
You...

295
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,420
What are you doing?

296
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,540
It's like she's never been educated.

297
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,020
Guys, they are hiring over there.

298
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,140
Let's go and have a look.

299
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,300
Hurry up. Come.

300
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,540
Hurry up.

301
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,340
Right there. Look.

302
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,060
Hurry. Hurry up.

303
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,300
Come on. Hurry.

304
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,540
Go, go.

305
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,860
Yu, hurry up.

306
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,940
If we don't sign up,

307
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,580
we won't be able to see Little Bean.

308
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,860
Que, just to be sure.

309
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,740
You're sure we're going to the palace

310
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,900
to work not to be eunuchs?

311
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,780
For Little Bean,

312
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,100
just be a eunuch.

313
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,140
Go away.

314
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,860
I am the only boy of Family Xia now.

315
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I can't be a eunuch.

316
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,060
Let them castrate you.

317
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,620
All right, stop it.

318
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,660
People pretending to be refugees
were caught last time.

319
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,740
Be smart.

320
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,860
Don't give it away.

321
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,780
Come.

322
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,780
Wait up.

323
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,580
- Come on.
- Turn right.

[Workers Wanted]

325
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,860
What does it say?

326
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,540
Disaster relief provided.

327
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,860
If we leave Zhongji Court,

328
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,980
we won't get any more food.

329
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,780
What if they don't pay us for our work?

330
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,460
Who do we talk to then?

331
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,300
Yeah.

332
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,580
Am I right?

333
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,820
Right. What if they don't pay us?

334
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
My friends.

335
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,740
Anyone who works for us

336
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,660
can sign a contract of employment
with the Imperial Court

337
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,700
Contract?

338
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,620
Let's see. Come on.

339
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,060
What is this?

340
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,020
It is written.

341
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,620
What is this?

342
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,740
There's a contract to prove it.

343
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,700
If you don't pay us afterward,

344
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,740
can a piece of paper fill our belly?

345
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah, right.

346
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,420
Once you sign the contract,

347
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,300
the court
will pay one month's fee in advance.

348
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,020
So much?

349
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,060
So much money.

350
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,380
The money is here.

351
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,460
We keep our word.

352
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,580
We can't go.

353
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,660
Yu,

354
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,860
that's a lot of money.
Why is no one going?

355
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,140
As long as it's not to be a eunuch,

356
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,100
I am in.

357
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,460
I'll sign it.

358
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,500
And me.

359
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,900
We are a family of three.

360
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,940
No, four.

361
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,700
You promise it's not to be eunuchs.

362
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,300
Not eunuchs, I promise.

How many and how much are lost?

366
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,260
Where are you originally from?

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,260
All information needed.

Come on.

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,980
My lord,

370
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,100
our family lost so much.

371
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,540
We lost
four thousand acres of good farmland.

372
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,460
Four acres.

373
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,380
Which part of Lantian are you from?

374
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,220
Huanglu Town.

375
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,500
The three of us are brothers.

376
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
Yes, brothers.

377
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,020
Huanglu?

378
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
It's a town in Lantian?

379
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,260
Huanglu Town?

380
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,460
Huang with an H.

381
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,500
Lu with an L.

382
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,180
Right

383
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,740
Huanglu is not in Lantian.

384
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,220
But it's close.

385
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,340
The earthquake has also influenced us.

386
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,620
Same area.

387
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,340
The Crown Prince is very kind.

388
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,180
We hire to help those in need.

389
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,580
The disaster affected many places.

390
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,660
Since we are all in trouble,

391
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,180
we should all be treated equally.

392
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,780
Thus,

393
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,580
I'll relax the hiring restrictions.

394
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,500
Anyone who is in trouble can sign up.

395
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,500
I'll sign the contract.

396
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,460
And me.

397
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,660
Count me in. Don't push.

398
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,500
Count me in.

399
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Get in line. Don't push.

400
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:58,940
You go help.

401
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,420
Get in line.

402
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,020
Yes.

403
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,180
It's Huanglu Town, right?

404
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,060
Yes.

405
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,100
The next one.

406
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,220
Move to the side. Don't push.

407
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,420
- What about you?
- I was here.

408
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,140
Xing, thanks for your help.

409
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,140
It is my job

410
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,700
to support the Crown Prince
whenever I can.

411
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,180
It's getting late.

412
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,780
I have lessons
to give in Chongwen Pavillion.

413
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,500
As for the hiring here,

414
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,780
I'll have to leave it to you.

415
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,700
Sure thing.

416
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,260
Supporting the Crown Prince is

417
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,900
also my job.

418
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,140
Go to the back.

419
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,780
Mr. Bai.

420
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,860
Xing.

421
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,460
The one in the front. Don't cut in.

422
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,420
Stand still and don't cut in line.

423
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,300
One by one, you can all sign up.

424
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,620
No more pushing.

425
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,500
There.

426
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,940
Look.

427
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,660
Look at that.

428
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,540
Princes and Ladies,

429
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,380
you are the future of this country.

430
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,140
Only in good health

431
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,540
can you protect our country.

432
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,100
In seven days,

433
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,340
there will be the annual Barrier Race.

434
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,900
So next,

435
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,060
I'll be leading you
to do physical training.

436
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,220
Let's get familiar with the venue today.

437
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,580
Exercise yourselves.

438
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,820
Do not slack off.

439
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,660
I hope you take the physical training

440
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,580
seriously.

441
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,580
Give it your best try
in the Barrier Race.

442
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,420
Come on, let's go.

443
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:16,940
Come.

444
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,580
Finally, something I'm good at.

445
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,060
I'll show you what I can do.

446
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,340
Just be careful.

447
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,100
You care so much about me?

448
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,540
I care about my body.

449
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,580
It's not just about the body.

450
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,220
It's also about the brain.

451
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,380
You teased me?

452
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,420
Come on.

453
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,740
Mei Daidai.

454
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,020
I knew you'd come to my rescue.

455
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,740
I just can't let this delicate body
get hurt.

456
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,340
You're doing it again.

457
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,860
Look at Miss Mei.

458
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,780
I can't believe
she has such a loyal servant girl.

459
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,060
Little Sparrow.

460
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,100
Come here.

461
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,900
Look at her servant girl.

462
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,820
Why can't you be like that?

463
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,540
Come on.

464
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,020
Little Sparrow, you...

465
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,820
Be careful, Your Highness.

466
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,700
Be careful!

467
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,540
Steady. Be steady.

468
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,660
Hurry up, you guys.

469
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:19,940
Don't rush us.

470
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,100
We can't steal the show
from the Crown Prince.

471
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,140
Yeah, yeah, of course.

472
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,620
Hurry, hurry.

473
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,980
Amazing.

474
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,140
Your Highness.

475
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,820
Your Highness.

476
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,220
Slowly.

477
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,020
Don't pull me.

478
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,980
I didn't...

479
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,500
Go, go, go on.

480
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Who can blame them?

481
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,940
I am so young, beautiful and charming.

482
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,140
These servant girls

483
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,660
just cannot resist my charm.

484
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,060
- Slower.
- I wish I could.

485
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,340
Brother, don't be upset.

486
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,540
These young ladies were educated

487
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,900
to be reserved.

488
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,580
One day when the servant girls

489
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,020
chase after you like they do to me now,

490
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,540
you'll see how annoying it is.

491
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,220
I just can't get rid of them.

492
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,500
Servant girls?

493
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,820
There.

494
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,340
See?

495
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,060
You...

496
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,820
Are you okay?

497
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,980
No wonder she never hangs out with us.

498
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,820
Turns out she aims a lot higher than us.

499
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,540
Come on, come on.

500
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,580
It's so boring.

501
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,660
Good job.

502
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,020
You want to play another game?

503
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,380
If Miss Mei insists,

504
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,780
I won't refuse.

505
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,860
This Miss Mei is really something else.

506
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,780
Interesting.

507
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,860
You dare to challenge the Crown Prince.

508
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,700
So improper.

509
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,820
You don't look like a lady at all.

510
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,460
I don't care if he's the Crown Prince.

511
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,700
I only know it's fun.

512
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,700
This one is so boring.

513
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,420
Why don't you go after that flower ball?

514
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,980
Whoever gets it first wins.

515
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,300
It's part of the Barrier Race anyway.

516
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,420
It'll be like a rehearsal.

517
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,820
If Miss Mei thinks it's unfair,

518
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,260
we can play something else.

519
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,660
This one it is.

520
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,980
Good.

521
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,420
Yeah, this one.

522
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,460
Get ready.

523
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,180
Go.

524
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,660
Come on, come on.

525
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:00,140
Your Highness, go on.

526
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,260
Your Highness.

527
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,060
Come on, come on.

528
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,540
Little Master, you will lose.

529
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,420
Why do you say so?

530
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,820
Come on, Yao.

531
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,980
Come on, Your Highness.

532
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,980
Come on, Yao.

533
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,300
Hurry, Your Highness.

534
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,140
Foul play.

535
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,980
When did that happen?

536
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,820
Hurry up.

537
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,940
I'm going to beat you today.

538
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,300
Touch the flower ball first.

539
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,100
Hurry up.

540
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,660
Don't start talking to her.

541
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,100
Beat her.

542
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,620
Almost there.

543
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,460
Your Highness.

544
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,540
You're going to lose.

545
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,900
So are you.

546
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,460
Little Bean.

547
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,340
Little Bean?

548
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,380
If we don't sign up,

549
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,060
we won't be able to see Little Bean.

550
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,860
Isn't Little Bean her?

551
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,180
Little Master, are you all right?

552
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,140
I'm fine.

553
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,500
We fell.

554
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
You didn't win.

555
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,660
Why are you so happy?

556
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,380
Your Highness.

557
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,140
Oh, Your Highness.

558
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,860

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,500
No wonder someone starts to have dreams.

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,340
I guess she reads too many stories.

574

She wants something she doesn't deserve.

575

We have to be more respectful to her.

Who else could it be?

580
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,740
She thinks because she can paint,
she can dream of Eighth Prince.

581
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,980
How ridiculous.

Why don't you go to the training field

and put everything away?

590
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,940
Isn't that what servants should do?

591

You are right.

She called Eighth Prince a boy?

Where did the boy get the wrong idea?
