00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,700
What's to worry about?

372
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,740
You forgot?

373
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,620
You still haven't given me
back the pearl.

374
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,260
It's been a long time.

375
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Then tell me about it.

376
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,940
What's so special about that pearl?

377
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,380
I...

378
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,540
I'll be honest with you.

379
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,020
I have a friend

380
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,420
who is the daughter...

381
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,660
No.

382
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,420
She is a real lady
from a very decent family.

383
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,820
She suffers from hysteria.

384
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,700
She talks nonsense all day.

385
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,660
She can't even recognise her own mother.

386
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,340
Wait.

387
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,860
What does that have
to do with your pearl?

388
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,940
It's an expert's advice.

389
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,140
This pearl is the only thing

390
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,780
that can cure her hysteria.

391
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,540
Think about it. We are so close.

392
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,020
I, Dou...

393
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,500
Mei Yushan, can never

394
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,020
be someone that looks the other way

395
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,580
while someone needs my help.

396
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,420
How could I stand to see her stay sick?

397
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,460
The pearl cures diseases?

398
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,100
This is the first time I have heard

399
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,260
about such a weird thing.

400
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,220
Besides,

401
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,020
I've never heard of you

402
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,580
talking about this good friend.

403
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,340
I...

404
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,140
I did talk about her.

405
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
You forgot.

406
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,860
If she really suffers from hysteria,

407
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,940
she can go to the Grand Tutor.

408
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,340
He is an amazing physician.

409
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,300
No, no.

410
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,460
It doesn't have to be so complicated.

411
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,900
A disease that can be cured by the pearl

412
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,700
shouldn't bother the Grand Tutor.

413
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,860
A quarter past Si hour.

414
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,340
Course for Law Theories.

415
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,780
Oh, lord.

416
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,300
The skill of imperial embroiderers
is terrible.

417
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,540
Not even as good as my embroiderers'.

418
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,540
You don't understand.

419
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,660
His Highness hates wasting money.

420
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,860
Maybe he's worn it for ten years.

421
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,140
And it got out of shape.

422
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,180
You didn't give it to the Crown Prince?

423
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,420
I did.

424
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,620
He loved it.

425
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,820
Why is it still hanging in the room?

426
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,420
I, uh... After I gave him the sachet,

427
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,660
he was so happy.

428
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,340
I can't give all the gifts
to him all at once.

429
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,860
Besides,

430
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,020
you put a lot of effort into it.

431
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,780
Look how well it's drawn.

432
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,060
Very vivid.

433
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,980
It's a masterpiece.

434
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,420
How can I give it away so easily?

435
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,420
I didn't pay too much attention.

436
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,700
I could do so much better.

437
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,740
But if you like it,

438
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,900
you can keep it here.

439
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,900
Your Highness, your tea.

440
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,220
Go get Miss Mei from Guixiu Pavilion.

441
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,340
Yes.

442
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,500
Your Highness,

443
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,660
I have important news.

444
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,100
Are you sure?

445
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,820
The night of the theft,

446
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,460
someone found it out in the garden.

447
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,700
But you were also
in the garden that night.

448
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,260
Mr. Zhang dared not tell anyone.

449
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,500
He worried he may offend you.

450
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
So no one ever said anything.

451
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,740
Also,

452
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,900
after this pearl got lost,

453
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,860
no more thieves showed up in the Museum.

454
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,580
It seems that all the thieves

455
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,860
came for the pearl.

456
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,340
Does the Moon Spirit Pearl

457
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,340
really have some sort of power?

458
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,220
I have no idea.

459
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,860
Because it is from Shengdong,

460
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,780
the Museum didn't value it too much.

461
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,420
I guess something unusual happened

462
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,180
in the Museum that night.

463
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,860
But if someone did steal it,

464
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,420
why did this pearl
end up with Mei Yushan?

465
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,300
I'm afraid only Miss Mei knows.

466
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,420
Take a look.

467
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,330
[Escort]

468
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,420
[Sealed]

469
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,140
Princess Yueying,

470
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,940
I need to go back to help my father.

471
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,420
You stay right here.

472
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,260
Don't cry.

473
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,260
Remember. My name is Xingshi.

474
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,940
I will come back for you.

475
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,020
So you are Princess Yueying.

476
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,940
Little Master really said
he wanted to return something?

477
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,620
Really. Hurry, my lady.

478
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,030
[Xingqing Hall]

479
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,700
Little Master, I'm here.

480
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,460
Little Master.

481
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,580
Mei Yushan, how dare you!

482
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,100
You deceived me, the Crown Prince.

483
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,620
What's up?

484
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,780
Do you know I can have you beheaded?

485
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,180
I was just kidding.

486
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,420
I will not have you beheaded.

487
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,020
Don't you cry.

488
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,060
What's happening?

489
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,660
His Highness caused a trouble.

490
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,340
He hasn't fixed it yet.

491
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,460
Go on.

492
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,900
Get some
of Miss Mei's favourite pastries.

493
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,780
Yes.

494
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,940
Get up. Come on.

495
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,780
You need to stop crying and get up.

496
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,980
I can't get up.

497
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,380
Come on.

498
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,300
I can't.

499
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,180
My legs are failing me.

500
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,700
There are pastries for you.

501
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,420
Flirting.

502
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,940
I am a eunuch.

503
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,860
Why do I have to
watch these things every day?

504
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,100
If you don't get over here,

505
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,580
I'll have someone take it away.

506
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,940
You won't cut my head off, will you?

507
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,100
I won't.

508
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,420
That's good.

509
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,220
Does it taste good?

510
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,140
Yeah.

511
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,820
Then tell me about it.

512
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,740
Why would you have the Moon Spirit Pearl

513
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,180
that was stolen from the Museum?

514
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,020
Water.

515
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,020
Here.

516
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,540
What are you so excited about?

517
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm not blaming you for...

518
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,300
Of course, I didn't steal it.

519
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,380
I am the daughter
of the Grand Chancellor.

520
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,780
Why would I steal that?

521
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,100
A stupid pearl.

522
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,500
Then how did you

523
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,980
get this pearl?

524
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,340
I...

525
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,500
I... I...

526
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,540
It's not the Moon Spirit Pearl.

527
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,420
It's just an ordinary pearl

528
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,580
that looks like the Moon Spirit Pearl.

529
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,780
Ordinary pearl?

530
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,180
It must also have a story.

531
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,340
It's... It's

532
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,300
something from home.

533
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,140
It's always been
in the Grand Chancellor Residence.

534
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,620
Then how did the expert
who gave your friend advice

535
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,940
find out

536
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,100
you happened to have a pearl

537
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,540
that could cure her?

538
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,660
Ah...

539
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,460
You told me to come and get the pearl.

540
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,900
Why are you interrogating me?

541
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,060
Just make up your mind.

542
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,300
Are you giving me back the pearl or not?

543
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,100
Questions remain unsolved.

544
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,380
How can I give it back?

545
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,540
Zuo.

546
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,100
Yes.

547
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,460
Walk Miss Mei back for me.

548
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,460
Take this pastry, too.

549
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,340
Yes.

550
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,330
[Eastern Palace]

551
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,180
You can leave me here.

552
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,140
I'd like to walk around alone.

553
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
His Highness will blame me
if he finds out.

554
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,660
Just tell him

555
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,060
someone came to pick me up.

556
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,260
What about the pastry?

557
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,900
I have had enough.

558
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,860
You take it back.

559
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,660
I don't believe

560
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,540
there is anything I can't get.

561
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,540
Even the vegetable left

562
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,020
between a God's teeth.

563
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,140
I will get it.

564
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
Come here. Over here.

565
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,500
This way.

566
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,380
Okay.

567
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,300
Listen up.

568
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,740
A bit more.

569
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,700
Mosquito repellent must be spread

570
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,180
to every corner of the Eastern Palace.

571
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,180
If I see any mosquitoes

572
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,420
tomorrow,

573
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,780
you will be punished.

574
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,340
Yes.

575
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,860
Be careful.

576
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,380
It's a rare breed. It's very delicate.

577
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,420
I'm losing my grip, my lord.

578
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,580
May we take a break?

579
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,700
Useless loser.

580
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,380
Gently.

581
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,780
Don't yell. You fool.

582
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,540
This is the Eastern Palace.

583
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,300
Okay, my lord.

584
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,380
Get out of here.

585
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,540
You.

586
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,660
Give me a hand.

587
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,140
Me?

588
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,340
Yes, you.

589
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,740
Hurry up.

590
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,780
Come on, you two, that way.

591
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,140
Okay.

592
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,780
Don't move.

593
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,460
Have I ever seen you before?

594
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
You got the wrong person.

595
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,420
I remember now.

596
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,100
You... You were the one

597
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,300
who tried to molest me.

598
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,140
I am not. You're lying.

599
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,380
You not only covet my beauty

600
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,340
but also

601
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,460
followed me to the Eastern Palace.

602
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,780
I must have justice today.

603
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,700
Someone.

604
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,860
- We can talk about this.
- Somebody.

605
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,340
- Calm down.
- Somebody.

606
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,700
Help.

607
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,540
Who is making the noise?

608
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,020
Help, please.

609
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,660
Somebody!

610
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,380
What's wrong?

611
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,140
That little servant girl.
She molested me.

612
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,060
She went that way.

613
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,020
Lunatic.

614
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,740
Ignore him. Let's go.

615
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,860
Stop there.

616
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,180
What are you doing?

617
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,940
What are you doing?

618
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,140
I see you.

619
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,180
Get out of here.

620
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,220
Come out!

621
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,660
Scoundrel.

622
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,820
Get out of here.

623
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,500
You can't escape.

624
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,220
How dare you!

625
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,860
Arrest him.

626
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,820
Your Highness, forgive me.

627
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,620
I shouldn't have yelled.

628
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,660
But I really have something to report.

629
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,340
Your Highness, please help me.

630
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,980
So I could die with comfort.

631
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,100
What to report?

632
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,740
There's a little servant girl, she...

633
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,220
She molested me.

634
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,820
I believe someone might molest them.

635
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,420
But you...

636
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,420
Do you understand what molesting means?

637
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,260
I dare not lie.

638
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,660
That little servant girl

639
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,380
ran into one of these rooms.

640
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,660
I believe

641
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,540
she is hiding somewhere now.

642
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,180
Nonsense.

643
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,260
So you mean

644
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,020
a servant girl
who serves me molested you?

645
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,500
No, I dare not,

646
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,060
I dare not say such things.

647
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,340
