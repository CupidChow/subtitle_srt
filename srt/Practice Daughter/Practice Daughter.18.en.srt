Bai Ye, what is going on here?

183
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,460
Little Diviner, what are you doing?

184
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,300
Douzi.

185
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,420
I already know everything.

186
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,940
About what?

187
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,380
The Crown Prince must not know about it.

188
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,580
Your Highness.

189
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,100
What I did today was all for you.

190
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,860
Also for...

191
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,660
Anyway, whatever happens,

192
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,980
I have to kill her today.

193
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,700
You can punish me after.

194
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,060
Why do you want to kill Mei?

195
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,700
Bai Ye, have you lost your mind?

196
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,780
I have to

197
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,420
kill her.

198
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,540
Little Diviner, put the knife down.

199
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,900
I'll save her.

200
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,220
You won't be able to kill her.

201
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,060
Your Highness,

202
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,300
Mr. Bai does everything

203
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,380
to save your life.

204
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,580
Do you know

205
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,700
the true identity of her...

206
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,340
Lingxiao!

207
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,020
True identity?

208
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,580
- You mean...
- Yes.

209
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,180
I know the true identity of this maid

210
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,580
is the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

211
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,300
I'm afraid she'll ruin

212
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,980
the relationship between you and Douzi.

213
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,740
So I have to kill her.

214
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,100
Just because we switched bodies,

215
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,140
you want to kill Mei?

216
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
What are you talking about?

217
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,540
Mr. Bai, why don't you tell the truth?

218
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,700
I'm telling the truth.

219
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,820
I've known for a long time
that they switched bodies.

220
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,500
Bai Ye, you worry too much.

221
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,100
And the relationship between Douzi and I

222
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,900
won't be affected by her identity.

223
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,140
Bai Ye, tell me the truth.

224
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,140
Do you really want

225
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,780
to kill her for Douzi and me?

226
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,340
Yes.

227
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,820
Is our friendship
for more than ten years

228
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,340
not enough for you to trust me?

229
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,180
It is because of what we've been friends
for ten more years,

230
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,820
I find you extremely strange today.

231
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Little Diviner, put the knife down.

232
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,740
Douzi!

233
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,660
Miss Mei.

234
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,380
Douzi!

235
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,260
How is it? Is it bad?

236
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,540
It's just a flesh wound.

237
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,700
No bones are broken.

238
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,340
Didn't you hear Guard Xingshi say

239
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,740
it was just a fall?

240
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,860
As the Imperial Physician,

241
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,140
I know what to say.

242
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,740
Don't call me

243
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,780
to treat minor injuries like this
in the future.

244
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,620
Grand Tutor,

245
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,620
please also check her.

246
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,380
I am fine.

247
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,260
Is that even an injury?

248
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,260
Grand Tutor,

249
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,660
just check her.

250
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,500
Girls care about their appearances.

251
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,620
It will be awful if a scar is left.

252
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
I'm fine.

253
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,580
Okay then.

254
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,900
I have a little pill here.

255
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,340
Here.

256
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,660
Crush it

257
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,980
and apply it to the wound.

258
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,060
I need to talk to Guard Xingshi
about something.

259
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,460
Please suit yourself, Eighth Prince.

260
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,900
You saved my life again today.

261
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,820
Fortunately, I showed up in time.

262
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,460
Now that you know I'm not the Princess.

263
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,980
Why did you give your life to save me?

264
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,540
I just

265
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,820
don't want you to get hurt.

266
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,940
Did Bai Ye know
that you switched bodies?

267
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,220
Yeah.

268
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,940
Then why did he still want to kill you?

269
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,420
Because

270
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,740
he's even less willing to kill Douzi.

271
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
So you mean

272
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,380
he tried to kill the Princess.

273
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,900
Or rather,

274
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,380
he thought if he killed the one
with the fishtail-shaped mark,

275
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,260
he'd stop the country
from its destruction.

276
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,980
Or was he trying
to protect the Crown Prince?

277
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,780
You can rest assured.

278
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,500
He didn't tell the Crown Prince

279
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,340
about Douzi's true identity tonight.

280
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,100
He most likely never will.

281
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,540
Douzi should be safe for now.

282
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,700
No.

283
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,780
Bai Ye will not give up.

284
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,340
You and the Princess must leave
the palace as soon as possible.

285
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,300
I'll never forget

286
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,500
that you saved me today.

287
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,740
If one day you need my help,

288
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,940
I would like to give up my life
to help you

289
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,860
without hesitation.

290
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,820
But I hope

291
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,300
you won't think you can decide for me

292
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,820
because of what happened today.

293
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,300
It's...

294
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,660
[Tianji Mansion]

295
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,020
Bai Ye of The Tianji Mansion

296
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,580
acted impulsively.

297
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,380
You are supposed to be put into jail,

298
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,740
but the Crown Prince made an exception

299
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,900
for the sake of the past friendship.

300
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,580
From today on,

301
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,420
The Tianji Mansion will be guarded.

302
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,140
People entering and leaving
are required to register.

303
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,700
Bai Ye will be grounded
in the Tianji Mansion for half a year.

304
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,060
During this period,

305
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,100
you are not allowed
to leave the mansion.

306
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,620
Mr. Bai,

307
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,820
when His Highness is in a better mood,

308
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,660
I'll put in good words for you.

309
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,860
Let's go.

310
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,750
[Tianji Mansion]

311
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Your Highness,

312
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,100
take care of yourself.

313
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,180
Your Highness is concerned about people
in the whole world.

314
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,540
Didn't you once tell me

315
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,660
that in the future,

316
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,500
you'd be a wise emperor?

317
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,420
A prophecy has caused so much chaos.

318
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,740
All the officials

319
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,300
are writing memorials
to depose the Crown Prince.

320
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,980
Your mother is busy all day
trying to calm things down.

321
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,220
Your Highness,

322
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,980
do you want your mother
to worry about you, too?

323
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,500
Grand Tutor,

324
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,820
do you also think

325
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,100
that I'll lead Jixi to its destruction?

326
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,740
I dare not.

327
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,740
But

328
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,740
Bai Ye's prophecies

329
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,660
have always come true.

330
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,460
No one dares doubt him.

331
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,380
Then I will not

332
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,700
fall for that Princess of Shengdong.

333
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,700
I won't even fall for anyone.

334
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,140
Then the prophecy will be broken,
won't it?

335
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Your Highness,

336
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,860
in the world, one's love for others

337
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
is usually beyond their control.

338
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,620
There are many people

339
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,660
stir up trouble

340
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,860
for their love.

341
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,660
I don't understand what you mean.

342
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,540
Who I fall in love with in the future

343
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,340
should be under my control, right?

344
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,020
I will control thousands of troops
in the future.

345
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,820
I can even control a person's,

346
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,540
or even a nation's fate.

347
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,100
But I can't control who I love or hate?

348
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,020
Your Highness,

349
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,460
you're still young.

350
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,580
When you grow up,

351
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,700
you'll know.

352
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,500
[Sealed]

353
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,340
The day I first met Little Diviner,

354
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,900
the sky was full of stars like this.

355
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,540
I think

356
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,460
Little Diviner must have his reasons.

357
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,220
I don't want to lose him as a friend.

358
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,060
But the person he wanted to kill

359
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,900
happened to be Mei Daidai.

360
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,260
Mei Daidai.

361
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,580
About your switched bodies,

362
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,780
I would like to ask for your opinions.

363
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,980
Mei Yushan,

364
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,140
with your status,

365
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
it's not right to be a maid
in the palace forever.

366
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,060
Now that someone wants you dead.

367
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,540
We must plan ahead.

368
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,140
If you want to go back home,

369
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,220
I can explain it to your family for you.

370
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,540
If you don't want to go back,

371
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,060
you can ask for other things.

372
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,540
I'll try to give you what you want.

373
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,180
As for Douzi,

374
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
you don't need to worry about her.

375
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,740
I'll get her a new maid
to take care of her.

376
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,340
With this appearance,

377
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,380
how can go back to my residence?

378
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,100
I don't need a maid.

379
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,300
Besides, she's not a maid.

380
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,060
Whatever problems there are,

381
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,260
I'll solve them with her.

382
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,860
I don't want to be apart from her.

383
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
In that case,

384
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,900
I'll figure out something else.

385
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,540
I'm not leaving you anyway.

386
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,980
Whatever I have,

387
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,460
you'll have it.

388
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,140
If the bed is too hard for you,

389
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,580
I'll give you all my quilts.

390
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,740
I've got plenty of padding anyway.

391
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,460
Silly girl.

392
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,180
If you're with me all the time,

393
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,220
how do you get married?

394
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,780
If I get married,

395
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,180
I'll marry someone rich.

396
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,580
So next to my big house,

397
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,900
I'll build you another big house.

398
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,660
And then,

399
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,620
I'll punch a hole in the wall.

400
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,700
So when I sleepwalk,

401
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
I can still talk to you.

402
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,300
Just the two of us are fine.

403
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,660
I'm not going to stay single
and spend the rest of my life with you.

404
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Then you can get married.

405
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,340
I'll stay single.

406
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,620
You don't have to build me a big house.

407
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,860
I'm not used to it anyway.

408
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,420
Just prepare me enough chicken legs.

409
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
I was in the Eastern Palace
for the past several days.

410
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,100
I didn't get a chance to ask you.

411
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,100
Why did Little Diviner try
to kill you that day?

412
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,460
- I...
- Do you really want to know

413
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,380
why Bai Ye wanted to kill Mei?

414
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,060
Oh.

415
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,180
Why can you make no sound when you walk?

416
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,940
Are you feeling better?

417
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,940
Don't run around before you're healed.

418
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
And don't say anything you shouldn't.

419
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,300
Get back to rest.

420
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
This time tomorrow,

421
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,300
find a way out of the city gate on time.

422
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,380
Then,

423
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,900
I'll be there waiting for you.

424
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,660
What do you mean?

425
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,780
Don't you want to know

426
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,060
- why Bai Ye...
- Xingshi.

427
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,740
I think she should know the truth.

428
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,180
You can rest assured.

429
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,100
After you are out
of the city gate tomorrow,

430
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,460
no matter whether you decide

431
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,580
to leave or stay,

432
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,540
I won't try to convince you otherwise.

433
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,780
Your Highness.

434
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,020
Your Highness.

435
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
I'll take my leave.

436
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,380
I'll leave too.

437
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,220
Okay.

438
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,140
What were you talking about?

439
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,300
Acting all mysterious.

440
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,860
You stopped talking when you saw me.

441
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,780
We were just concerned
if Guard Xingshi was getting better.

442
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,300
Little Master,
now you know how to do it.

443
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,420
I don't want to be laughed at by you.

444
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,140
I wouldn't dare.

445
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Otherwise, you'll put me up
in the tree again.

446
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,860
What... What now?

447
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,500
I didn't offend you today.

448
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,500
I...

449
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,300
I suddenly remember

450
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,540
that I want to ask you something.

451
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,060
This place is full of bugs.

452
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
One sting leaves one bump.

453
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,180
It hurts.

454
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,780
I'll stop them for you.

455
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,500
So they can't sting you.

456
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
But if they sting you,

457
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,500
I'm going to hurt too.

458
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,300
What do you want to ask me?

459
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,700
Actually,

460
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,940
there's nothing urgent.

461
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,860
On our way back to the palace that day,

462
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,780
I asked you a question

463
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,500
and you haven't answered me yet.

464
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,900
I...

465
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,540
I answered.

466
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,460
Have you answered?

467
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,700
I remember after I asked you that day,

468
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,700
we just...

469
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,780
What are you doing?

470
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,100
It's broad daylight.

471
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,580
Answer the question I'm asking you.

472
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,780
If you don't remember,

473
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,700
I'll ask you one more time.

474
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,740
Would you like

475
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,420
to stay with me forever?

476
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,180
I told you the answer was on the ground.

477
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,020
See for yourself.

478
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,940
Stop.

479
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,580
Step back.

480
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,180
Step back.

481
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,740
Step back.

482
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,900
Okay.

483
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,980
Who did this?

484
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,900
It's so asymmetrical.

485
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,260
Does this person want
to make His Highness angry on purpose?

486
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,300
It's fine.

487
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,460
I quite like it.

488
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,540
By my orders,

489
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,020
reward the gardeners

490
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,740
who take care of this season's flowers.

491
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,180
You are the future emperor.

492
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,820
The Crown Princess's the future empress.

493
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,220
Managing the harem
is a great responsibility.

494
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,540
If you make her your wife,

495
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,540
I'm afraid
she won't deserve the crown.

496
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,420
All of you, leave.

497
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,060
I think the so-called virtue

498
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,180
shouldn't be just some etiquette.

499
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,100
It should be
the most basic human qualities.

500
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Douzi is brave, righteous, and kind.

501
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,780
She is kind to her family

502
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,580
and generous to her friends.

503
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,300
To me...

504
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,700
She also protects me with her life.

505
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,740
So I don't think
she won't deserve the crown.

506
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,940
As for the harem you talked about,

507
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,020
if I have her by my side,

508
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,820
I will...

509
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,180
Will never marry other women.

510
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,420
Well.

511
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
It seems

512
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,340
you really like her.

513
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,740
Fine.

514
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,300
Just make her your concubine.

515
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
It'll stop people from gossiping.

516
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,700
As for the Crown Princess,

517
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,260
we choose someone else.

518
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,420
I have made up my mind.

519
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,740
If you don't allow it,

520
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,340
I will...

521
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,900
Never get married.

522
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,500
You...

523
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,780
That's the end of this matter.

524
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,500
Wait until I confer with your father.

525
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,620
It's gruesome in here.

526
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,300
Why did you bring me here?

527
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,300
Why are there no names

528
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,060
on these memorial tablets?

529
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,220
Who were they?

530
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,500
They were the Princess's family members

531
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,620
and officials.

532
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,220
Emperor Dingning,

533
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,580
Empress Li

534
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,740
and my father.

535
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,660
None of them can have their names.

536
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,100
If the war hadn't destroyed our country,

537
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,020
they'd all have been
watching you grow up, Princess.

538
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,820
What are you talking about?

539
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,100
Aren't you going to tell me

540
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,980
why Bai Ye wanted to kill Mei Yushan?

541
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,260
It's not even Spring Festival yet.

542
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,100
You don't have to do this.

543
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,020
I, Shengdong's Young General Xingshi

544
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,820
show greetings your highness,
Princess Yueying.

545
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,820
Don't scare me.

546
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,340
Is there anyone else here?

547
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,420
There's no one else here.

548
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,180
I am just greeting my Princess.

549
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,260
You greet me?

550
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,700
I'm the Princess?

551
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,220
And you are
the Young General of Shengdong?

552
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,580
Guard Xingshi,

553
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,860
what is wrong with you?

554
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,140
Did you get some kind of pearl

555
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,540
and switch your body
with that toothless storyteller?

556
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,460
You make up good stories.

557
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,620
Don't even start.

558
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,700
Get up.

559
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,460
You are indeed the daughter
of Emperor Dingning

560
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,860
and Empress Li of Shengdong,

561
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,180
Princess Yueying.

562
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,740
Princess Yueying?

563
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,300
Why don't you say

564
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,700
I am Chang'e on the moon?
[*A Chinese mythological figure]

565
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,740
If I were Princess Yueying,

566
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,260
First Father would be the Jade Emperor.

567
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,780
Second Father would be the Dragon King.

568
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,460
And Third Father

569
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,340
would be the Monkey King.

570
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,500
I know it's hard for you
to believe this all of a sudden.

571
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,700
But I dare not lie

572
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
in front of all the spirits
of martyrs here.

573
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,420
Eighteen years ago,

574
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,140
Shengdong was destroyed.

575
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,860
Your mother, Empress Li,
entrusted you to my father.

576
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,540
My father fled with you and me.

577
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,460
We ran into pursuers on our way.

578
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,380
So my father entrusted you to me.

579
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,620
In the end, I had no choice

580
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,420
but to hide you in a box
of an escort team near the road.

581
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,340
By the time I got back,

582
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,980
the escort team had already left.

583
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,020
He doesn't seem

584
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,700
to be joking.

585
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,740
But I don't look like a princess.

586
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,020
My figure?

587
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,020
It belongs to Mei Daidai.

588
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,300
It's not mine.

589
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,780
If you don't believe me,

590
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,060
I can swear in front of all the spirits
of martyrs of Shengdong.

591
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,500
No.

592
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,780
You must have confused me
with someone else.

593
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,060
I grew up in the Black Dog Alley.

594
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,540
I've never been outside the capital.

595
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,940
Forget about the Princess of Shengdong.

596
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,820
I don't even know how to spell

597
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,940
Shengdong.

598
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,180
And I have no idea

599
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,820
how people of Shengdong

600
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
look like.

601
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,980
You know what? I'll get going.

602
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,620
See you.

603
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,140
You were too young
when we left Shengdong.

604
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,780
It's normal that you don't remember
anything about it.

605
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,540
But I remember everything clearly.

606
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,580
The kerchief you had with you back then

607
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,900
was embroidered
with lilies of the valley.

608
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,220
That is the national flower
of Shengdong.

609
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,540
In the box where you were hidden,

610
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,860
there were some clay pots.

611
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,900
To prevent bumps on the road,

612
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,940
some rice beans were stuffed.

613
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,900
There was also a pink rattle drum.

614
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
The most important thing

615
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,260
is that I left a mark on the box.

616
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,940
Do you still remember?

617
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,660
How do you know all this?

618
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,420
You looked into me
in the Black Dog Alley?

619
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,700
You were born with a fishtail-shaped mark
on your shoulder.

620
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,700
If I made this up,

621
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,220
how would I know that?

622
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,580
What... What is going on here?

623
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,820
We were trying
to hide from the pursuers.

624
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,260
And I went back to save my father.

625
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,540
I had no choice

626
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,260
but to hide you in a box
by the side of the road.

627
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,900
When I got back to find you,

628
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,660
the escort team had already left.

629
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,380
I'd been having nightmares for years.

630
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,420
I was wondering how the little Princess

631
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,700
survived in this dangerous world
on her own.

632
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,700
I'd been full of remorse

633
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,820
and looking for you all the time.

634
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,220
But it's been so hard to find you
among so many people.

635
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
I even thought...

636
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,980
I...

637
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,020
I even thought

638
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,540
you were already dead.

639
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,460
Every time I thought about it,

640
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,780
it was like
there was a huge rock on me.

641
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,780
I couldn't breathe.

642
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,220
Is what you said

643
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,780
the truth?

644
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,140
If I lie about any of it,

645
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,780
I won't die in peace.

646
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,100
But...

647
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,300
I don't understand

648
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,980
what all this has to do with
Bai Ye trying to kill Mei Yushan.

649
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,140
If Bai Ye does not kill Mei,

650
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,860
he will have to

651
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,140
kill you.

652
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,900
The person he wants to kill

653
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,780
is me?

654
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,180
Have you heard of the prophecy?

655
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,660
The Crown Prince of Jixi falls in love
with the Princess of Shengdong.

656
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,780
Jixi will be destroyed.

657
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,140
Don't touch me.

658
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,580
Princess,

659
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,020
now that it's not safe

660
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,620
and you and Miss Mei
are out of the city,

661
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,540
I don't think you should go back.

662
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,340
Where else should I go then?

663
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,420
I'll get you home safely.

664
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Home?

665
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,020
Back to the Black Dog Alley?

666
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,300
Back to Shengdong.

667
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,380
Why would I back to Shengdong?

668
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,860
Everyone in Shengdong is looking forward
to your return.

669
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,860
To rebuild our home.

670
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,340
I'm not an orphan.

671
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,260
My mother didn't abandon me.

672
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,540
She did it to save me.

673
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,460
Back then the city was under siege,

674
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,500
she had to send you away.

675
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Your mother

676
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,060
must have suffered a lot.

677
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,180
Mothers in the world

678
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,780
would all make the same choice.

679
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,660
Do you think

680
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,620
that prophecy will come true?

681
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,140
I hope not.

682
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,660
If Little Master finds out,

683
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,700
will he try to kill me?

684
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,020
He will never find out.

685
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,940
Xingshi and I won't tell anyone.

686
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,580
Bai Ye would rather
be punished himself that day

687
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,620
than tell the Crown Prince the truth.

688
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,900
As long as he doesn't say it,

689
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,500
the Crown Prince will never know.

690
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,700
Mei is right.

691
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,180
But don't forget, Princess,

692
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,620
Bai Ye knows about your switched bodies.

693
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,860
He even tried to kill Mei.

694
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm afraid he won't give up.

695
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,620
He did it on the spur of the moment.

696
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,460
Besides,

697
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,980
he's already locked up.

698
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,140
Then why would we risk going back
to the palace?

699
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Why don't we just...

700
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,820
Why don't you leave with me now?

701
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,140
Shengdong's former subordinates
are nearby.

702
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,220
They can pick us up at any time.

703
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,220
- No.
- No.

704
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,060
If you insist
on returning to the palace,

705
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,740
the next time you meet the Crown Prince,

706
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,220
you'll be enemies.

707
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,420
No.

708
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,780
Impossible.

709
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,100
Impossible.

710
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,380
Have you ever wondered, between you

711
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,020
and the throne of Jixi,

712
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,380
which one the Crown Prince will choose?

713
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,500
I beg of you, Princess and Mei,

714
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,380
to seriously consider
coming back to Shengdong with me.

715
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,180
I'm not going back to Shengdong.
