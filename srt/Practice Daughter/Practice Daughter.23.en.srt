00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,800
Douzi has lived in this alley
for over a decade.

185
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,240
You think she doesn't know you?

186
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Douzi,

187
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,200
how have you been in the palace?

188
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
It's better than jail.

189
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,440
A few more places
to walk around than here.

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,640
But it's not as good as here,

191
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,000
where I can do whatever I want.

192
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,320
Silly girl,

193
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
what's so great about this house?

194
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,560
It's tiny

195
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,800
and everything is old.

196
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,000
Your Third Father farts all the time,

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
which has even made the quilts dirty.

198
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Your First Father isn't any better.

199
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,000
When he takes off his shoes,

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,840
the whole house smells of his feet.

201
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,280
I've mastered a new way of breathing.

202
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,920
Douzi, I've just noticed something.

203
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
Being the Princess

204
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
is so much better
than being the Crown Princess.

205
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
What are you doing?

206
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,040
Do you have to rub it in?

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,800
Shut your mouth
if you don't know what to say.

208
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,280
Exactly.

209
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,120
Keep your mouth shut.

210
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,280
It's...

211
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,760
It's...

212
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
How senseless you are!

213
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
Did you forget what happened

214
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,640
between Douzi and the Crown Prince?

215
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,240
So don't talk about it now.

216
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,040
Do you hear me?

217
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,840
Douzi.

218
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
You... Are you okay?

219
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm fine.

220
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm bored sitting here.

221
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll go get some air.

222
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,700
Wait, Douzi.

223
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,460
I said something wrong.

224
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,460
Well...

225
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,580
It's better to be the Crown Princess
than the Princess.

226
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,300
What?

227
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,740
Did I say something wrong again?

228
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,660
- You...
- So annoying.

229
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,300
The roast chicken is mine.

230
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,580
- It's Mine.
- It's Mine.

231
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,580
Your Majesty.

232
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,340
You can't do that, Your Majesty.

233
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,260
How could you do such a menial thing?

234
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,700
Let me do it.

235
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,500
Your Majesty, this is my fault.

236
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,980
Let me do it.

237
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,100
Your Majesty, this is all my fault.

238
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Greetings, Your Majesty.

239
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,940
You don't need to do this to me.

240
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Your hands are so cold.

241
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,820
You must be freezing.

242
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,380
Go get a warmer.

243
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

244
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,580
If you're not satisfied
with these people,

245
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,820
just tell me.

246
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,740
I'll get you someone else.

247
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,900
I refused the title you gave me.

248
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,860
It's normal for them
to be a little disrespectful.

249
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,340
I know

250
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,340
you've been mad at me.

251
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,740
But even if I made a mistake,

252
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,540
you can't hate me forever.

253
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,820
You are the Emperor.
You're never wrong.

254
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,100
I dare not hate you, Your Majesty.

255
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,180
If you don't hate me,

256
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,900
why didn't you accept the title?

257
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,660
For things like this,

258
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,500
you can leave them to the servants.

259
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,460
I know

260
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,820
it will take a while

261
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,500
for you to accept the title.

262
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,380
I shouldn't be so hasty.

263
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,100
But I'll wait for you

264
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,180
until you feel comfortable with me.

265
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,140
Take good care of Mei.

266
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,300
No one can neglect her.

267
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,980
If she feels ill,

268
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,140
I'll behead all of you.

269
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,700
Mei

270
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
will be your empress one day.

271
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
- Yes.
- Yes.

272
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,420
Little Master?

273
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,940
I miss you so much.

274
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,620
I miss you so much.

275
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,820
Little Master!

276
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,220
- Greeting, Princess.
- Greeting, Princess.

277
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,300
How dare you

278
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,220
not greet me?

279
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,380
- You may all get out.
- You may all get out.

280
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

281
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,140
I need you to do me a favor.

282
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,260
I want to leave the palace
to find my Little Master.

283
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,380
You blamed me
for being Xingshi's accomplice,

284
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,900
yet now you're asking me for help.

285
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Aren't you afraid
I'll tell Xingshi right away?

286
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,940
I am sorry.

287
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,420
I saw the Crown Prince get hurt
so badly that day.

288
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,820
That's why I said those hurtful things.

289
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Dear Mei Daidai, I'm worried sick.

290
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,380
You're still in the mood
to play with paper here.

291
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,340
Am I playing?

292
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,020
I'm folding paper cranes
to pray for the Crown Prince.

293
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,300
I hope he's safe and sound.

294
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,980
Dear Mei,

295
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,100
I really know I was wrong.

296
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,740
Just forgive me.

297
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,540
Please help me.

298
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,100
Help me.

299
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,620
All right.

300
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,660
I'll help you.

301
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,660
Let go first.

302
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,700
This is very serious.

303
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,100
I just need you to help me.

304
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,380
Okay, I'll help you.

305
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,700
I've got a plan.

306
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Listen to me.

307
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,460
I'll hide on that palace wall.

308
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,460
As soon as it gets dark, I'll jump off.

309
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,980
You need to go to the palace gate

310
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,100
and yell fire,
"Come and put out the fire!"

311
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,220
Then the guards will rush out

312
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,100
and I can
take the opportunity to escape.

313
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,260
And then we'll both get caught.

314
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,700
Don't tell me
that you spent all day and night

315
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,900
coming up with this plan.

316
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,420
How do you know?

317
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,980
Do you think the guards are all idiots?

318
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,980
I think I know who can help us.

319
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,820
But he can only help you
out of the palace.

320
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,140
You will have to get someone
to pick you up.

321
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,020
My three fathers can pick me up.

322
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,660
I'll send a message to them.

323
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,300
Your three fathers...

324
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,180
They are not very reliable,

325
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,980
but they will be serious
about my affairs,

326
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,060
I guess.

327
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,380
You have no idea
how hard this has been for me.

328
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,580
It was so quiet

329
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,940
in such a big house.

330
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Without you by my side,

331
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,780
I almost got bored to death.

332
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,860
I think the big bed is much better.

333
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,580
If this were the tiny one we had before,

334
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,140
I would push you down by now.

335
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,420
Now this is big enough for you.

336
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
It's so big

337
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,940
that there's room for two more people.

338
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,060
If only little Master were here.

339
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,300
I didn't say he should lie down here.

340
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,340
I wonder

341
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,380
how Little Master is now.

342
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,660
Keep your voice down.

343
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,740
There are Xingshi's
eyes and ears outside.

344
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,420
Seriously.

345
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,020
Once you find the Crown Prince,

346
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,100
what are you going to do?

347
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,100
I can't think that far ahead.

348
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,540
When I find him,

349
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,940
I think

350
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,860
we'll have the wedding night first.

351
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,420
Do you know what you'll do
on the wedding night?

352
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
No idea.

353
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,820
But I've heard from others

354
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,180
that after the wedding,

355
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,460
the most important thing

356
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,820
is the wedding night.

357
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,180
Do you know about it?

358
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,700
Then tell me about it.

359
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,100
How would I know?

360
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,220
I'm not married yet.

361
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
I thought you knew everything.

362
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,900
However,

363
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,460
I read a little about it
in the books my brother privately kept.

364
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,460
Well, then tell me about it.

365
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,020
Tell me about it.

366
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,860
You'll know when it happens.

367
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,300
Stingy.

368
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,420
Then I'll ask Little Master about it.

369
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,460
He will teach me.

370
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,260
You can't just ask about it.

371
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,420
Have you forgotten
what's in Moral Instruction for Women?

372
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,140
At moments like this,

373
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,580
you should be more reserved.

374
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,180
Don't allow your impatience
to get in the way.

375
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,940
If he doesn't take the initiative,

376
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,700
just sit there and be elegant.

377
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,540
- You must have manners.
- You must have manners.

378
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,580
I already knew
what you were going to say.

379
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,980
I'm tired of hearing about it now.

380
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I'm tired of it, too.

381
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,820
I'm kidding.

382
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I'm tired of being Mei Yushan

383
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,300
who has to speak and act cautiously,

384
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,740
follow the rules,

385
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,500
and remember the advice of the elders,

386
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,380
but always grieves herself.

387
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,300
Don't worry.

388
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,500
I'll be here.

389
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,940
I won't allow you
to grieve yourself anymore.

390
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Douzi,

391
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,020
I actually envy you a lot.

392
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,100
You're never bound by rules.

393
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,020
When you want something, you go for it.

394
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,660
When you want to say something,
you say it.

395
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,300
Mei Daidai,

396
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,020
do you really think so?

397
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
I don't want to lecture you anymore.

398
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,340
You can do whatever you want.

399
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,740
Let me know when you need help.

400
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,580
I'll always be here.

401
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,620
I'll come to you in the future.

402
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,140
You can rest assured.

403
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,740
Someone can't wait to see her husband.

404
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,500
She starts bidding farewell
to me already.

405
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,260
Did I hurt you?

406
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,900
Let me see. Let me see.

407
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,740
Let me see.

408
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,900
Isn't this Grand Chancellor Mei?

409
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,740
Who is it out there?

410
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,180
Mr. Liu.

411
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,900
Where are you and Mrs. Mei going?

412
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,820
Shan misses home.

413
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,220
So she summoned us specifically.

414
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,020
Mr. Mei has a wonderful daughter.

415
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,780
With your daughter,

416
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,940
Mr. Mei will have a bright future.

417
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,980
Of course.

418
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,660
Let's go.

419
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,300
Former ministers who once assisted
the Crown Prince

420
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,260
were all dismissed from the palace.

421
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,820
He kept his title
because of his daughter.

422
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,460
Yet he dared show off in front of us.

423
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,860
The new emperor has just ascended.

424
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,580
If he hadn't required help,

425
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,220
he wouldn't have kept us either.

426
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,100
Right.

427
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,860
Bear in mind.

428
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,380
You need to be more careful now.

429
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,980
Don't let anyone find your fault.

430
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,500
I know.

431
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,740
The one that looks like Shan
is not the real Shan.

432
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,380
The one that doesn't look like Shan
is the real Shan.

433
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,860
Shan is not the original Shan.

434
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,500
The one who is not Shan is the Princess.

435
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,940
My daughter.

436
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,780
My Shan.

437
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,540
Shan.

438
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,020
It's...

439
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,300
Right.

440
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,580
This is my Shan.

441
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,940
Greetings, Princess.

442
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,780
Greetings...

443
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,740
Isn't this Shan's maid?

444
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,260
Uhh...

445
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,660
I can't tell, either.

446
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,860
You may all leave.

447
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

448
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,940
- This one.
- This is the Princess.

449
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,940
Greetings, Princess.

450
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,620
My daughter,

451
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,020
let me ask you.

452
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,300
Does the Emperor treat you well?

453
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,100
Do you even have to ask?

454
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,900
Look at our daughter's outfit.

455
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,860
The Emperor must adore her.

456
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,900
I used

457
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,340
to want you to be the Crown Princess.

458
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Now it seems

459
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,540
that this is so much better.

460
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,900
That's right.

461
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,100
Father, mother,

462
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
I have an important favor to ask today.

463
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,340
Shan, if you need anything,

464
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,380
just tell us. Don't be so polite.

465
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,620
Maybe when you become the Empress,

466
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
we will

467
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,820
need to kneel to you.

468
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,380
There is an old saying,

469
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,940
"Whatever the Emperor asks,
the ministers must do."

470
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,300
Right.

471
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,820
Your two brothers

472
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,140
would love to help you as well.

473
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,900
If they...

474
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,100
I summoned you this time

475
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,220
because I need your help
to get Douzi out of the palace.

476
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,780
Isn't she... Isn't she the Princess?

477
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,780
Why does she need to go out?

478
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,060
You can rest assured.

479
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,740
Even if I get arrested,

480
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,660
I will never turn you in.

481
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,660
It's not that we won't help you.

482
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,140
It's... It's just if we help you,

483
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,100
both of us

484
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,500
will get ourselves killed.

485
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,460
Right.

486
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,300
You have told me many times
to help my brothers.

487
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,300
Now that I need your help,

488
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,860
you choose to reject me.

489
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,860
We... We...

490
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,020
Are you really using me
as a stepping-stone?

491
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,900
Those are two different things.

492
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,780
If you don't want to help...

493
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,700
It's...

494
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,500
What are you doing?

495
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,860
Calm down.

496
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,460
Put it down.

497
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,460
That's your daughter.

498
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,020
You can't do this.

499
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
Let's just put it down.

500
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:38,940
Put it down.

501
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,340
You can't die.

502
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
If you die,

503
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,700
what will your parents do?

504
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,940
What is the Mei Family going to do?

505
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,740
And for your two older brothers,

506
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,860
they won't be able to get jobs
in the imperial court

507
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,420
and can't find wives.

508
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,620
That's too bad.

509
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,420
Exactly.

510
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,740
Yes, my daughter.

511
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,100
Shan,

512
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,220
listen to me.

513
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,180
Put the scissors down.

514
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,260
We can talk.

515
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,420
I'll discuss this with your mother.

516
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,060
Okay?

517
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,700
Right.

518
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,100
Come on.

519
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,580
Let's talk.

520
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,460
Put the scissors down.

521
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,220
Put it down first.

522
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Be a good girl.

523
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,780
Look

524
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,700
how much she scared me!

525
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,180
Am I putting on a good show?

526
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,380
You are so good at it.

527
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,180
All right.

528
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,020
Let's go.

529
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
Shan,

530
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,500
your father and I
have reached an agreement.

531
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,420
This one.

532
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,500
Right.

533
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,370
[Danfeng Gate]

534
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,740
Stop.

535
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,220
Stop.

536
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,460
Stop.

537
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,860
I said stop.

538
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,420
Routine checkup.

539
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
I need to do a routine checkup.

540
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,180
Please cooperate with us, Sir.

541
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,700
Congratulations, Sir.

542
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,020
Let them pass.

543
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,580
Let's go.

544
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,460
Look at my age...

545
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,620
This is embarrassing.

546
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,020
Come out.

547
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,060
Thank you.

548
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,460
It's fine.

549
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,060
Thank you.

550
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,060
You...

551
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,660
Your Majesty,

552
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,260
we have looked everywhere.

553
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,860
Still haven't found the Princess.

554
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,060
A bunch of losers.

555
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,260
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

556
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,900
I kept watching here every day.

557
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,660
The Princess went to...

558
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,340
She went to the imperial concubine's

559
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,020
and never came back.

560
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,340
Do you mean

561
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,780
this is Miss Mei's fault?

562
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,860
I dare not.

563
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,940
Go look for her now.

564
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,820
Yes.

565
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,300
All of you, go look for her.

566
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

567
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,460
Let's go.

568
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,380
My daughter.

569
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,100
What are you here for? Stop.

570
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,340
What is in there?

571
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,700
Cry.

572
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,500
You can go.

573
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,700
I'm sorry.

574
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,860
Let's go.

575
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,060
Halt.

576
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,740
We couldn't afford it...

577
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,620
Don't move.

578
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,100
- Sir, you listen to me.
- Step back.

579
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,900
Who's in there?

580
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,580
Please, Sir,

581
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,260
She is my daughter.

582
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,700
My daughter is dead.

583
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,340
She was so poor.

584
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,980
Let me tell you.

585
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,580
Open it.

586
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,980
She choked to death eating chickens.

587
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,980
Can't you come up with something easier?

588
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,860
She looks terrifying now.

589
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,660
Sir. Sir.

590
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,860
- Don't open it, Sir.
- Sir.

591
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,220
Step aside.

592
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Please don't open it, Sir.

593
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,820
Go away.

594
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,420
Sir.

595
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,620
Sir. Sir.

596
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,740
Scary, right?

597
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,540
She died terribly.

598
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,620
Stop.

599
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,260
Que Kuai'er.

600
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,900
Sir.

601
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,100
- Please no.
- Sir.

602
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,860
How do I know if she's dead
without stabbing?

603
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,900
She's very dead.

604
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,420
Get away.

605
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,900
- She's risen from the dead.
- She's risen from the dead.

606
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,020
Look. Did you see that?

607
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,660
The corpse... The corpse ran away.

608
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,420
It ran away.

609
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,780
Ran away.

610
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,020
Let's go.

611
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,140
Close the door.

612
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,180
Hurry, hurry.

613
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,620
Why here again?

614
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,780
Haven't we been here before?

615
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,460
What should we do?

616
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,500
Go. Search it.

617
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,540
Stop talking and find a place to hide.

618
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,300
This way.

619
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,740
- No, no.
- Go somewhere else.

620
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,860
I was here first.

621
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,580
Don't crowd.

622
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,220
Hurry up.

623
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,980
Hurry, hurry.

624
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,300
Search over there.

625
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Search the west wing.

626
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,060
Yes.

627
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,700
The place hasn't been taken care of
for a long time.

628
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
There's dust on your face.

629
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,420
Come out, all of you.

630
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,700
Aren't you here to arrest me?

631
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,300
Yes.

632
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,460
But I won't arrest you.

633
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,420
I know you've been looking for him.

634
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,100
He's outside the city right now.

635
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,700
Really?

636
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,060
Take this map with you.

637
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,180
You'll find him.

638
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,780
You're really willing
to let me go to him?

639
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,380
If I say yes,

640
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,340
that must be a lie.

641
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,220
But now

642
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,100
I am not as obsessed as I used to be.

643
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,980
In this world,

644
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,380
if two of my favorite people
can be together,

645
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,580
I'll be happy for you.

646
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,900
Little Diviner.

647
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,820
Someone is coming.

648
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,980
Someone is here.

649
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,580
Someone is coming.

650
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,700
You need to go, Douzi.

651
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,340
Will Xingshi blame you if I leave?

652
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,300
I'll find an explanation.

653
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,260
The back door is over there.

654
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,380
Just go.

655
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,940
Okay.

656
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,300
Why are you still here?

657
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,620
What will you do if we all leave?

658
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,580
- Yeah.
- Well...

659
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,340
We'll leave one to you.

660
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,420
So you can explain to them.

661
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,740
What are you doing?

662
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,700
I don't want to stay here.

663
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,420
Staying here...

664
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,820
I haven't had enough
of my good life yet.

665
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,020
Hurry up.

666
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,820
All right.

667
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
Give me this.

668
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,020
All right, be careful.

669
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,340
You give me that.

670
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,660
Take it.

671
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,860
Why is it so heavy?

672
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,340
I got it. I got it.

673
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,300
Slowly.

674
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,700
Do me a favor. Be careful.

675
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,340
Come on.

676
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,100
Don't worry. Give it to me.

677
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,620
Come here.

678
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,780
Did you pee in the river yesterday?

679
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,380
I remember it was you.

680
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,860
We have to clean the pots
and dishes in the river.

681
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,260
No more peeing in the river.

682
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,940
You hear me?

683
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,340
Yes.

684
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,780
Add more water. There's smoke.

685
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,180
All right.

686
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,100
Did you

687
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,780
grow it yourself?

688
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,420
Yes.

689
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,820
We can't rob others anymore.

690
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,660
Yes.

691
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,100
Let's get this upstairs.

692
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,380
All right.

693
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,700
One, two, three.

694
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,820
What's the hurry?

695
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,820
Come here.

696
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,580
Come on.

697
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,940
This way. Over here.

698
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,260
Your Highness.

699
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,900
I just met a child picking herbs.

700
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,900
At the age of four or five,
he came out to earn a living.

701
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,300
The life of our people
is getting harder and harder.

702
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,580
Loyal ministers

703
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,180
who were good at governing the country
were dismissed as my henchmen.

704
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,700
These innocent civilians are homeless

705
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,380
and forced to become bandits.

706
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,140
Such a situation

707
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,500
is par for the course.

708
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,340
Our troops of Jixi
have quietly gathered.

709
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,420
We're all looking forward
to fighting back to the imperial city

710
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,780
and helping you reclaim your power.

711
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,940
I have one more important thing to do.

712
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,460
The bandits nearby have all surrendered

713
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,980
except the Heifeng Gang.

714
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,100
If we take them down,

715
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,900
it'll be a great relief.

716
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,700
And it will save these civilians
from their worries.

717
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,860
The sect's chief offered to meet you

718
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,380
to see if we are sincere or not.

719
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,540
Might as well.

720
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,620
Then let's meet him.

721
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Shidian Village.

722
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,700
Shi...

723
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,980
Turn here.

724
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,700
[Follow the Huangyi Road]
And then along the Huang...

725
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,060
Huangtu Road?

726
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,620
Who named it that?

727
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,220
Might as well call it Huangquan Road.
[*The road to death in Chinese sayings]

728
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,020
I didn't even bring any money with me.

729
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,900
I have to steal then.

730
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,660
[Huangquan Road]

731
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,460
There is really a Huangquan Road.

732
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,140
Does Bai Ye want to get me killed?

733
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,460
Hurry up.

734
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,180
Take everything.

735
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,860
If we don't buy it now,
the price will go up.

736
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,860
Don't wait until it's too late.

737
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,460
Hurry.

738
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,780
- There will be nothing left soon.
- Go.

739
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,380
- Give it to me.
- That's mind.

740
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,820
- Don't push me.
- This is mine.

741
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,060
- Hurry up.
- It's mine.

742
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,340
I saw it first.

743
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,940
Who dropped the bag?

744
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,620
You don't want your bag back?

745
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,260
Hurry up.

746
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,140
What are you doing?

747
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,740
Forget it.

748
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,300
I'm just checking if there's any food.

749
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,870
[Diagnosis]

750
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,820
Fatal illness?

751
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,500
This is life-saving money.

752
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,180
I need to find the owner and return it.

753
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,780
- Come on
- Come on.

754
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,740
I'll come back later.

755
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,540
I've got a lot.

756
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,220
Hurry.

757
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,820
Someone else will take it all.

758
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,140
- Are you okay?
- Others will take it all.

759
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,020
Why are they fighting over there?

760
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,100
Now the Emperor is not doing anything.

761
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,180
It's a mess everywhere.

762
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,100
It's getting dark. It's not safe.

763
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,060
Just go home.

764
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,620
I want this.

765
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,580
It's not safe?

766
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,220
I grew up here. Of course it's safe.
