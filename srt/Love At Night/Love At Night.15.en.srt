00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,480
It's said that

4
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,879
cactus used to be

5
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,519
the most delicate thing in the world.

6
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,040
She fell in love with a traveler
who came to the desert by chance.

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,480
But the traveler hurt her badly.

8
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,720
He put a thorn in her heart.

9
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,320
The cactus couldn't pull out the thorn,

10
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,240
she can only let spikes grow all over her body

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,880
as a weapon to protect herself.

12
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,759
There was a tumbleweed

13
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
who grew up around the cactus.

14
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,919
He tried to pull the thorn out of the cactus.

15
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,839
But he didn't know

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,559
this thorn has become part of the cactus.

17
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,279
If this thorn is forcibly removed,

18
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,839
it will only hurt the cactus.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,080
But the tumbleweed couldn't bear

20
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,479
to see the cactus suffer.

21
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,759
So he had to come up with a stupid solution.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,720
Fang Qi.

23
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,000
You are back.

24
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,440
Are you hungry?

25
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,559
I'm going to heat up your dinner.

26
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,199
No, thanks.

27
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sleepy. I'm going upstairs.

28
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,639
Help me! Help me!

29
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,199
Don't keep saying I'm a kid.

30
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,320
I have grown up.

31
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm so much taller than you.

32
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm Fang Qi's fiancé, Xu Wei.

33
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,919
But as long as I can handle it,

34
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,320
I will stand in front of you

35
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,399
and protect you from any harm.

36
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,959
No, no, no.

37
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,119
No, no.

38
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,359
No.

39
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,559
Kitten.

40
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:29,839
Don't be afraid.

41
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm coming to save you.

42
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,160
How did you get up so high?

43
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,679
Kitten.

44
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,160
Come here.

45
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,519
Don't be afraid.

46
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,279
Don't be afraid. I'm coming to save you.

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,079
It's okay. It's okay.

48
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,480
All right.

49
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,279
Let me pick you up

50
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,359
and go down, okay?

51
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:06,679
Okay?

52
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,839
It's quick.

53
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,480
I will be quick.

54
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,480
Just a minute.

55
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,720
It's fine. It's fine.

56
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,920
Don't be angry.

57
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,440
Don't be angry.

58
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,239
Just one minute, okay?

59
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,839
It's okay.

60
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,959
It's fine.

61
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,119
I got you.

62
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,440
It's okay.

63
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,279
Don't move. Don't move.

64
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,600
Be nice.

65
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,160
What are you doing?

66
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,200
Can you take the cat?

67
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Don't be afraid.

68
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,880
Be careful!

69
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,000
It may be a little scared and scratch you.

70
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
Be careful. Take care.

71
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,679
Thank you.

72
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:27,920
Give it to me.

73
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Don't be afraid.

74
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,640
Okay. Okay.

75
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,959
I'll let you go home, okay?

76
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,600
Go.

77
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,679
You need to be careful.

78
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,679
Not every time I'll be by your side.

79
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,330
(Fan Yunxi)

80
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,559
Hello?

81
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,720
Still up?

82
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,480
It's late. What's up?

83
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,079
My mom said she wanted to

84
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
take a family photo before surgery.

85
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you have time?

86
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,600
Our current relationship

87
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,119
maybe...

88
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,559
She said she was afraid if the surgery failed...

89
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:19,880
Ok.

90
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,640
Then tomorrow.

91
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,760
You are awake.

92
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,599
Breakfast is ready.

93
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,719
Come down and have some milk.

94
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,200
No, thanks.

95
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
I'm late. I have to go to work.

96
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,119
Wait a minute!

97
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,000
Why do you look so pale?

98
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,479
Don't move.

99
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,679
Your forehead is hot.

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,039
Do you have a fever?

101
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,760
I know if I have a fever.

102
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,400
I have to leave.

103
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
What do you know?

104
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,520
If you know,

105
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,840
you will not go to work right now.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
You don't know how to take good care of yourself.

107
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,440
Thirty-eight degrees.

108
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,599
Come with me to see the doctor.

109
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,599
There is no need to go to the hospital.

110
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,960
I just need to take some medicine.

111
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,080
I have to work.

112
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,559
Go to the hospital.

113
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,000
Xu...

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
- Xu Wei!  - Hurry up.

115
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,200
The doctor decides whether you're sick or not.

116
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,919
I...I have to go to work.

117
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,760
Hello Ms.

118
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,119
Your makeup is ready.

119
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,359
Please have a rest here for a while.

120
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,640
Thank you.

121
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,200
Qingyou, sorry to trouble you.

122
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,280
You took a leave of absence to here.

123
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,280
Auntie, don't be so polite to me.

124
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,840
I'd like to dress up

125
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,880
and take a good picture with you.

126
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,119
Really?

127
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,520
Then we're really on the same page.

128
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,479
Come on.

129
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,440
Come to my office next time for details.

130
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, Mr. Mo.

131
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,080
- I'll go. - Bye.

132
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,039
Isn't it?

133
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,840
- Well, we will have a look first.  - Okay.

134
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,159
Yunxi, look.

135
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,559
Youyou?

136
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,960
What's up?

137
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,440
Nothing.

138
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,239
Yunxi.

139
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,559
Why don't we choose this?

140
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,679
You take a rest on the couch.

141
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,760
I'll make you some porridge.

142
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,359
What did you promise me just now?

143
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,760
You just got back from the hospital.

144
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,599
Don't you remember to take care of your body?

145
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,400
Who are you talking to?

146
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,520
Be polite to me.

147
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,280
Don't be so cocky.

148
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,880
Do you know who you are?

149
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,159
I'll help you clear your head right now!

150
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,239
Wait a minute!

151
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,159
You have no say

152
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,400
as a patient.

153
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
If you are not sick, I will be polite.

154
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,400
Really?

155
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
It hurts!

156
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:18,119
I'm sorry. Sorry.

157
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:18,799
Why apologize?

158
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,520
I shouldn't be unpleasant to you.

159
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,719
I shouldn't be impolite to you.

160
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,039
Okay, fine.

161
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,640
I forgive you.

162
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,919
Luckily, I'm so tolerant.

163
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,520
What else?

164
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,359
It's not my place

165
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,239
to tell you what to think.

166
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Nor should I make casual comments about your actions.

167
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
It's all in your past after all.

168
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,359
I haven't experienced it.

169
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Okay.

170
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,599
It's good to be aware of your mistakes.

171
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,239
I'm tolerant.

172
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,880
Someone else will definitely beat you!

173
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,159
I scold you and you laugh?

174
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,640
Is there something wrong with you?

175
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,479
You have the strength to scold me now,

176
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,400
which means you feel better.

177
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,039
Well,

178
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,400
in the tumbleweed story

179
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,640
you told me last time,

180
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,840
did he come up with a stupid way?

181
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,640
The way tumbleweed

182
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,919
came up with is

183
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,559
to refuse the invitation of the wind.

184
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,599
He took root around the cactus,

185
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,960
sheltered her from wind and rain,

186
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,479
and resisted all harm.

187
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
When she felt safe enough,

188
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,280
when she was willing to take off her own thorn

189
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,400
and showed the scar,

190
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,520
then...

191
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,359
Then what?

192
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,280
Then he used his own leaves

193
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,719
to repair the wounds on the cactus,

194
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,559
so that she can recover completely.

195
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,320
Nonsense!

196
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,559
They are not of the same species at all.

197
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,000
There's no way to heal each other.

198
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,719
Besides that,

199
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,080
tumbleweeds can't take root.

200
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,080
None of this makes any sense. Nonsense...

201
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,599
What did you say?

202
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,799
Have it your way.

203
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,400
I'll make you some porridge.

204
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
Stop looking at the computer.

205
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,760
Drink that cup of hot water first.

206
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,719
Eve, I want to ask you that

207
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,239
(Lyuluo's weibo)
if you moisturize your skin in daily life?

208
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,400
No. Absolutely not.

209
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,479
So why is your skin still so good?

210
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,359
No way.

211
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,520
We are the first trending topic!

212
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,559
What about the turnover?

213
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,280
The deal is over 30 million yuan!

214
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,400
My KPI this month is going to be over 3.5!

215
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,479
Lyuluo has up to five million followers!

216
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,080
Qingyou,

217
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,159
the target set up by you to Mr. Zhai

218
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,520
has been completed ahead of schedule!

219
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,599
Great, Qingyou!

220
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,400
We never have to be apart again.

221
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,880
I'll treat you to afternoon tea.

222
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,559
Whatever you like.

223
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,719
We have worked hard these past few months.

224
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,159
I declare that

225
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,840
a two-day tour of Man'an Hills for all

226
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,039
will be held this weekend!

227
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,640
Bravo!

228
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,679
Thank you, Mr. Zhai!

229
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,719
Come on! Go to work!

230
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,400
Go back to work.

231
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,039
Qingyou, invite Mr. Mo to join us.

232
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,640
After all, he stood up for us.

233
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,760
We should thank him.

234
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,119
No problem.

235
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,760
Mr. Mo.

236
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,559
Excuse me, what would you like to drink?

237
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,880
Matcha latte, thanks.

238
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,919
Ok.

239
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,959
Director Xu took the initiative to ask me out.

240
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,040
What's up?

241
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,880
Mr. Mo.

242
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,400
Since you took over the investment management of Lemi,

243
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,400
you have been helping us with your best efforts.

244
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,719
Mr. Zhai appreciates you very much.

245
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,000
Every success of Lemi

246
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,479
will be counted in my performance.

247
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,160
So you're welcome.

248
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,000
It's my duty.

249
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,479
Youyou, which pictures do you like?

250
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,560
Today I'm going to...

251
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,599
Does Director Xu want to say that

252
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,959
taking photos with your fiancé

253
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,239
is just to help?

254
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Director Xu likes to do charity in private.

255
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,800
It's no need to tell me.

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,959
Indecision invariably leads to trouble.

257
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,319
The worst thing about breaking up

258
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,640
is hesitating.

259
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,400
I advise you to make it quick.

260
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,439
I have my own reasons.

261
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,839
He is in a crisis.

262
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,640
I can't just leave him there.

263
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,040
Exes that broke up with you

264
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,959
shouldn't be in your phone contacts.

265
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,160
You'd better do something else with your overflowing love.

266
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,239
I see. I see.

267
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,640
Why did Director Xu make an appointment with me today?

268
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:27,000
Our company will organize team building activities.

269
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,640
Mr. Zhai asked me if I could invite you.

270
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,119
Did Mr. Zhai want to invite me?

271
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,520
Yes.

272
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,760
Thank Mr. Zhai for me.

273
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,560
I'm busy.

274
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,319
I have no time for team building activities.

275
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,160
Alright.

276
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,800
I'll tell him exactly what you said.

277
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,560
Thank you for your time.

278
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,920
Fang Qi, I really admire you.

279
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,119
How can you stand that Poker Face?

280
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,199
Hello?

281
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,800
You mean that

282
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,760
there's something interesting.

283
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,040
Share with me.

284
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
Today, Eve and Lyuluo's joint live streaming

285
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,680
hit 30 million yuan in sales.

286
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,040
Isn't that nice?

287
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,479
What does that have to do with Poker Face?

288
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,439
Yes, it's nice.

289
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,319
All my good feelings have been ruined.

290
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,880
Mr. Zhai was very happy.

291
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,680
He asked all the staff to join the team building activities,

292
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,760
and specifically asked me to invite Mo Lingze.

293
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,680
So you went to Mo Lingze alone

294
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,400
and he gave you a cold shoulder, right?

295
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,760
I even stressed that

296
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,920
it's Mr. Zhai who asked me to invite him.

297
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,640
I didn't expect that he refused directly.

298
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,280
He didn't save me any face.

299
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,199
Poker Face,

300
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,760
deserves his reputation, you know?

301
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,800
You have no idea what he was like.

302
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,359
He's not a Poker Face at all.

303
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,640
He's a hard, sharp steel ball!

304
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,040
Let me guess.

305
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,079
The steel ball must say like this.

306
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,520
Director Xu, if you have nothing else to say,

307
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,719
I would leave first.

308
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,400
Isn't it?

309
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,560
More than that.

310
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,239
He said

311
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,839
he doesn't have time.

312
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,520
Hello,

313
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:16,959
I'm home.

314
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,680
Talk to you later. Bye.

315
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,800
It's me again, a steel ball.

316
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,280
Sorry to let you down.

317
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,719
You misheard me.

318
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,079
I meant to say you're strong

319
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,119
like steel.

320
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,119
I wanted to compliment your decision-making ability.

321
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
And it was a joke.

322
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,760
No need to the pigeon-holing.

323
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,280
Dare to do, dare not admit.

324
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,520
It doesn't sound like you.

325
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,239
Inquisitive.

326
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,479
It's still your style.

327
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,280
Won't you come in?

328
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,800
No, thanks.

329
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,680
Instead of quarreling with Mr. Mo,

330
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,560
I would rather stay here alone.

331
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,210
(Acupoints)

332
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,400
What are you doing? Who's there?

333
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,680
You're trying to get your boss killed!

334
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,760
It's in public.

335
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,520
I am a tyro.

336
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:41,880
Practice with me.

337
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,680
No way.

338
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,319
With this technique,

339
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,839
you will pinch me two pounds of meat.

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,040
But I want to know

341
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,119
why do you practice this?

342
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,239
Are you adding new business to the studio?

343
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,359
No.

344
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,920
Fang Qi has an irregular sleep schedule all year round.

345
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,560
There must be something wrong with her health.

346
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,119
I just want to learn more

347
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,319
to take good care of her.

348
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,040
You can't just be a sweet guy.

349
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,359
Or you can only be put in the friend zone.

350
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
I don't want any more

351
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,560
bad advice from you.

352
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,520
That's a pity.

353
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:17,119
This is the secret of my love life.

354
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,680
Nice attitude.

355
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,280
Come here. I'm telling you.

356
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Firstly,

357
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,040
men are best looking when they're serious.

358
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,839
You have to stop hanging around with Fang Qi all the time.

359
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:38,760
Do you know?

360
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
Secondly,

361
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
you have to learn to read people's faces.

362
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,880
Women say one thing 
and they mean another most of the time.

363
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,880
When she says no,

364
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,280
she means yes.

365
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,400
When she says forget it,

366
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,959
you must not give up.

367
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,719
However,

368
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,560
when she says you are right,

369
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,640
you can't believe that!

370
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,000
Then what should I do?

371
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,040
Compliment after criticism.

372
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,359
Reverse thinking.

373
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,439
You need to impress her and conquer her

374
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,040
with a totally different perspective.

375
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,640
Men are best looking when they're serious.

376
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,520
You have to stop hanging around with Fang Qi all the time.

377
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,760
Fang Qi, there's a class reunion tonight.

378
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,839
You have to come!

379
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:17,640
Wear something nice!

380
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,400
Qu Kai's fiancé will come.

381
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:29,439
Are you marking exam papers
or practicing calligraphy?

382
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,520
It's all written exactly the same.

383
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,839
Are you either too lazy to see him,

384
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:38,280
or afraid of people will think you can't let him go?

385
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,719
Don't think you know everything about me.

386
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,959
In my opinion,

387
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,560
you don't need to hesitate.

388
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,839
As the saying goes,

389
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,760
only by facing the past bravely

390
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,439
can we have a bright future.

391
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,319
Are you really afraid to meet him?

392
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,079
Not at all.

393
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,040
I don't owe him anything.

394
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,160
What's the big deal!

395
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,479
I will go.

396
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
You look nice.

397
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,280
I wouldn't be ashamed to

398
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,359
take you out like this.

399
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,640
Do I have to wear this?

400
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,719
Of course!

401
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:35,119
Clothes make the man.

402
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Now that I've decided to go,

403
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
then we would be armed to the teeth.

404
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,199
Or you look like a kid.

405
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,520
I'm not a kid.

406
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,040
Only kids don't want to wear suits.

407
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
This would be appropriate.

408
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,359
Miss, you really have a good taste.

409
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,119
This is a new line

410
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,160
from ROARINGWILD.

411
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,000
And your boyfriend is handsome and in good shape.

412
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,119
It's perfect for him.

413
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,560
He is not my boyfriend. He is my little brother.

414
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:09,959
I'll take this.

415
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
She is my girlfriend.

416
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,959
She is a bit spoiled.

417
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,040
I'll take the suit and tie.

418
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,160
How much is the suit?

419
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,280
The suit is eight thousand yuan.

420
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,719
And two thousand yuan for the tie.

421
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,160
Wait a minute.

422
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,119
Just wear them.

423
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,119
I bought them for you.

424
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,000
No.

425
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,040
When I succeed in my career,

426
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,319
I'll pay you double.

427
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,680
Or they may think I'm supported by a woman.

428
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,599
And,

429
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
these count as our joint property.

430
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Are you taking advantage of me?

431
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,280
Only couple have joint property.

432
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,040
Go away!

433
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,000
Who knows what will happen.

434
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,839
Hello, Meng.

435
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,760
Hello, Qingyou.

436
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:39,920
I heard there's a meteor shower tonight.

437
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,199
Would you like to go 
and find a prime viewing spot with me?

438
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,160
No, I would not go.

439
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,280
I haven't packed yet.

440
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,359
See you at the barbecue tonight.

441
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,959
Okay, bye.

442
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,040
Okay.

443
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,420
(Lucky dress for you. 
Wish you success. Fang Qi)

444
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,640
That looks so sexy.

445
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:16,959
I won't wear this.

446
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,350
(One day  ago: -Mr. Mo. Do you have time 
for coffee and chat?- Okay.)

447
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,050
(Mo Lingze's Moment:  Only the moments 
of recent three days will be shown here)

448
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,439
(Fang Qi)
Nice dress.

449
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,599
But I'm too embarrassed

450
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,839
to wear that.

451
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,199
I can only admire myself.

452
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,280
What's the use of self-appreciation?

453
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,520
This beautiful dress is

454
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,920
meant to make you look amazing!

455
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
Let you catch everyone's eye!

456
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,359
Mr. Mo, why are you here?

457
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,640
Why can't I be here?

458
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,119
I remember you said you weren't interested.

459
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,160
I'm here to see about business.

460
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:09,839
Really?

461
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,719
I've never heard of

462
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,680
Man'an Group accepting outside investment.

463
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,839
Be sure to show off your nice body!

464
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,560
You must be the most attractive one 
in team building activities!

465
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,920
Director Xu, who do you want to show your nice body to?

466
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,680
Mr. Mo.

467
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,479
It's my personal matter.

468
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,119
I don't think I have to report to you.

469
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,599
Do me a favor. Quickly!

470
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,319
- What?  - Hide! Hide!

471
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,359
What happened?

472
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,199
Don't look at these.

473
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,040
You said you play well?

474
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,880
Wasn't it good?

475
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,439
What are you doing?

476
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,400
What were you so nervous about?

477
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,599
Nothing.

478
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,479
I just don't want to cause unnecessary misunderstanding.

479
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,599
What?

480
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,760
You haven't made yourself clear yet.

481
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:09,959
What else can I say?

482
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,520
I just want to pick my thing up.

483
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,520
I'm not interested in anything else.

484
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,680
I'll buy you a new one.

485
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:17,479
Director Xu just finished taking pictures 
with your ex-boyfriend,

486
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,680
and now you're attracting other men.

487
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,719
You are so fond of casting a wide net.

488
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,280
Am I in your net?

489
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,319
What Fang Qi just sent me is a joke.

490
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,040
The reason why I went to take pictures

491
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,880
was that Aunt Fan would have a surgery.

492
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,479
I did my duty as a junior.

493
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,760
What are you laughing at?

494
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,400
Are you laughing at me?

495
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm not like you.

496
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,719
Breaking up is a fact.

497
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,160
I broke up completely.

498
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,280
I'm not like you.

499
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,079
Fast Fooders in relationship.

500
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,439
Don't forget you have a whole roster.

501
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,400
As for me,

502
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,479
I'm just a female white-collar worker

503
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,160
in the roster.

504
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
In terms of time management,

505
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,119
I have to hand it to you.

506
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,599
Director Xu has so much against me

507
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,959
just because of a roster.

508
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:09,439
Help, Lingze!
