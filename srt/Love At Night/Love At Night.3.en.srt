=Episode 3=

3
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,319
Let go of me.

4
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,239
Why do you stop me?

5
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,639
I mean,

6
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,279
don't be excited, Miss Lin.

7
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,839
As the saying goes,

8
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,239
a little impatience spoils great plans.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,680
It took me a long time to think of this method.

10
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,400
I asked Sa for help many times.

11
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,720
It is that woman who profits from it in the end.

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,839
Love cannot be forced, indeed.

13
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,400
I beg your pardon?

14
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,120
I said nothing is impossible to a willing mind.

15
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,080
I won't give up.

16
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:13,960
Keep working.

17
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,039
Let's go.

18
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,279
How long will it last?

19
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,119
It's almost over.

20
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,759
Excellent.

21
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,830
(Do you want me to pick you up?)

22
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,039
Looks like she's having a good time.

23
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,839
Since you don't cherish such a good opportunity,

24
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,559
don't blame me

25
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,759
for acting in person.

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
What do you want?

27
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,039
I just want to help you solve the problem.

28
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,720
If you mean to help me,

29
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,039
just let it go.

30
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,160
Director Xu, don't flatter yourself.

31
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,759
What on earth did you think

32
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,119
happened to us that night?

33
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,080
No matter what happened,

34
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,199
it won't happen again.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,399
What do you want?

36
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,240
The problem is solved already.

37
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,320
If you want to be a player,

38
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,520
you are not good enough.

39
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,200
I can walk in a straight line.

40
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,640
Who can call me a cab, guys?

41
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll tip.

42
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,440
No need for tips.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,040
I'll drive you home.

44
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,359
I got a driver!

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,119
A handsome driver.

46
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,480
No wonder you look familiar to me.

47
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,679
I forgot Qingyou.

48
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,320
Fang Qi.

49
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,760
What are you doing?

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,559
Why did you come out alone?

51
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,600
Here you are.

52
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,000
I just wanted to find you.

53
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,839
Why are you here?

54
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,440
I...

55
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,679
I just finished my meal.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,559
Just passing by.

57
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
I've been to so many bars,

58
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
why can't I meet someone who fits my heart?

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
Tell me why!

60
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,959
You look in the bar every day,

61
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,160
how can you find such a person?

62
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,720
It makes sense.

63
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,279
Those men are well-dressed and dignified,

64
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,239
but they are actually unreliable and

65
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,320
unfaithful at all.

66
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,239
So is Fan Yunxi.

67
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:18,720
He is unfaithful too.

68
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:19,720
Qingyou.

69
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,839
What happened to you and your husband?

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,239
It's grown-up subjects.

71
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,559
It's grown-up subjects.

72
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,750
( Fan Yunxi calling. Declined)

73
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,760
Okay, stop it.

74
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,839
Why are you holding me?

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
Watch my fist!

76
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,320
Okay, that's enough.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,279
Take care of Fang Qi for me.

78
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,000
Drive her home.

79
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,239
I have to go.

80
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:45,119
Qingyou.

81
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:45,920
Where are you going?

82
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,040
I have some matters to solve.

83
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,760
Are you looking for brother-in-law?

84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,320
Mr. Mo.

85
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,480
I've transferred the hotel expanse to you.

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,440
Please check it.

87
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,200
I hope you stop saying

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,119
anything strange.

89
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
We are not the same kind of person.

90
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm engaged.

91
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,359
Your fiancé was completely insensitive
to your 10-year relationship

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,519
and cheated on you,

93
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,959
did you forget about it?

94
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,519
How did you know that?

95
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,359
You were drunk

96
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,640
and told me with your arms around me.

97
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,079
About that night,

98
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,760
just take it as a joke.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,679
I hope we can draw a line between each other,

100
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,399
don't get involved again.

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,480
Director Xu, you jeer at me

102
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,160
again and again,

103
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,839
it seems necessary for me to clarify with you.

104
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:47,200
Clarify?

105
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,160
Where are you going to take me?

106
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,399
I'm tired of walking.

107
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Answer me.

108
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,959
Am I attractive enough?

109
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,600
Am I pretty?

110
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,920
Am I pretty?

111
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,480
Answer me!

112
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,760
Why don't you answer me?

113
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,399
Men are all the same.

114
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,480
Same!

115
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,119
You know what?

116
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,359
Actually, I was getting married.

117
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,079
But all of a sudden,

118
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,880
I was cuckolded.

119
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,519
Look at me.

120
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,920
Am I pretty?

121
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,399
Yes.

122
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,679
I know it.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,040
I know I am beautiful.

124
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,839
I'm so pretty.

125
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,359
It's hateful.

126
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,440
It's so disgusting.

127
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,239
When we just

128
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,440
began to work,

129
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,720
I was poor.

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,839
I took the subway for an hour,

131
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,840
just because I miss you.

132
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,000
Now looking back,

133
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,960
from the beginning to now,

134
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,840
every time we date,

135
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,640
it's all me who spent time on the road.

136
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,080
Just because,

137
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
I miss you so much.

138
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:59,159
Then you worked in other cities for two years.

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,239
You were busy at work,

140
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,599
so I worked overtime desperately.

141
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,440
I thought,

142
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,200
if I worked so hard on weekdays,

143
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,520
I could go to your city to see

144
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:20,960
you on weekends.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,039
After that,

146
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,719
we were finally in the same city.

147
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,960
You were stressed on your job,

148
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,640
and I couldn't help you.

149
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
But what could I do?

150
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,039
I was trying to save money,

151
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,359
trying to budget.

152
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,760
I seldom bought clothes.

153
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,520
I saved all my money,

154
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,239
then I told you confidently,

155
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:56,880
"Don't worry,

156
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,239
we're rich now,

157
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,320
I can manage my life well.

158
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,239
You don't have to be stressed in finance."

159
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,679
In the past ten years,

160
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,760
I've been thinking about us.

161
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,880
What about you?

162
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,559
Thanks.

163
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,159
Cheers.

164
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,479
Who are you?

165
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,400
I see.

166
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,799
You are a refined rascal.

167
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,760
Seeing a girl like me was drunk,

168
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,719
you brought me to the hotel.

169
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,320
Listen,

170
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,159
I will hit you now on behalf of justice.

171
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
What were you trying to do?

172
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:22,760
Are you crazy?

173
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,000
No, no, no.

174
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,960
I give in.

175
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm out of breath.

176
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
Where are you going?

177
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,559
You are a muscle man.

178
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,280
I don't mean anything else.

179
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,200
I just...

180
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,239
What are you trying to...

181
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,080
You are crazy.

182
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,080
So it is.

183
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,200
Director Xu, you're not only bad at drinking,

184
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,799
but also bad after drunk.

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
You'd better not drink anymore.

186
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,280
Yeah.

187
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,922
You're right.

188
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,440
Sorry to bother you.

189
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,679
Wait.

190
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,200
Why did you come to me today?

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,719
I told you, to pay you back for the hotel,

192
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,559
and clarify.

193
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,760
To clarify what?

194
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,359
To clarify what happened between us.

195
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,320
What happened between us?

196
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,239
Right.

197
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,359
I didn't know until you told me.

198
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,919
Nothing happened.

199
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,400
Why does it sound like

200
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,559
you're disappointed?

201
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,119
Why should I be disappointed?

202
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,599
Your heart beats fast.

203
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,640
I came here by running.

204
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,840
No.

205
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,960
Because you lied.

206
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,479
There are several matters which you forgot,

207
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,039
but I didn't.

208
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,039
Fang Qi.

209
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,440
You've eaten so much,

210
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,559
don't be like this.

211
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,719
My sister is coming soon.

212
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Why did you call her?

213
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,359
Just a divorce.

214
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,760
I can let it go.

215
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,359
Next year I'll find someone better

216
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,760
to accompany me on my birthday.

217
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,080
If you can't find such a guy next year,

218
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,880
remember to call me,

219
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
don't celebrate alone.

220
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,280
Even so,

221
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,080
I have to find one guy

222
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,960
before I'm thirty.

223
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,840
I don't want to celebrate

224
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,919
my 30th birthday alone.

225
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,080
Don't cry.

226
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,159
Shut up. I'm not crying.

227
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,559
This pepper is too spicy.

228
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,359
I promise that

229
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,239
I'll be with you on your 30th birthday.

230
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,960
Taking outstanding men
from all walks of life as endorsers,

231
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:20,559
that's accessible and attractive.

232
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:21,799
Good idea.

233
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,919
I'm glad you like this idea.

234
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,960
Then let's carry forward in this direction.

235
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,400
Well then...

236
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,080
Mr. Mo.

237
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:29,719
Mr. Zhai.

238
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,880
Congratulations.

239
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,799
Congratulations, too.

240
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,000
Qingyou.

241
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,239
Here's a good piece of news.

242
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,840
The C Round Financing of Lemi and Shangger

243
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,919
has been completed successfully.

244
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,039
Congratulations.

245
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:39,840
As a matter of fact,

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,919
you're one of our founding members,

247
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,679
you share the credit.

248
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,640
You've played a major role this time.

249
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,320
Tell me.

250
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,000
What would you like as a reward? Just let me know.

251
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,799
If you don't mind,

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
can you approve

253
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
our project funds?

254
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,039
Mr. Mo, look at her.

255
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,359
She's bargaining with me now.

256
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,760
Director Xu's style of acting

257
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,200
has always been the same.

258
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
As for my style of acting,

259
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,199
you may not know.

260
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,119
Yeah.

261
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,199
That's why

262
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,760
we should have more contact with each other.

263
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,359
First time strangers, second time friends.

264
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:16,359
Oh right, Qingyou,

265
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,479
as for the Meeting Your Match,

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,640
I think,

267
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,479
you don't have to bother looking for a match.

268
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,719
It's at hand.

269
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,119
Just follow Mr. Mo's standard.

270
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,079
Mr. Mo is way too perfect.

271
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,160
It's too high for us to meet.

272
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,599
I didn't expect the estimation in Director Xu's heart

273
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,439
on me is so high.

274
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,040
Sure it is.

275
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,359
I got plans.

276
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,160
Excuse me.

277
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,280
See you, Mr. Mo.

278
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,359
Have a seat, Mr. Mo.

279
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:58,560
Hello?

280
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,640
Youyou.

281
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,000
Did you get the vitamins I sent to you?

282
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,920
Pay attention to your health anyway.

283
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,920
Yes.

284
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,479
Thanks.

285
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,920
I know you're still mad at me.

286
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,079
But it happened by accident.

287
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,439
I apologize.

288
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,119
Life and relationship can't afford any accidents.

289
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,199
We've been together for ten years.

290
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,800
Breaking up is too painful.

291
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,199
I can't bear it.

292
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,280
So do you, right?

293
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,359
Could you give me another chance?

294
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,319
If you get the second chance, can you make up?

295
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,920
You'll never know without a try.

296
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm working.

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,599
I'll hang up.

298
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,520
Attention, please.

299
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,520
Good news.

300
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,959
Our C Round Financing has been completed successfully.

301
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,319
Qingyou.

302
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,239
Does that mean
we're going to be financially free?

303
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,079
This is not a time we should take lightly.

304
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,079
I declare that Meeting Your Match
was officially launched.

305
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,280
You!

306
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,839
You'd better come to me
for something particularly important.

307
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,680
Otherwise, you're dead.

308
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,640
I brought you steamed stuffed buns and congee.

309
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,239
Enjoy. Your house is too far away.

310
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,079
It's getting cold.

311
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,119
For the sake of breakfast,

312
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,119
I won't blame you.

313
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,560
Have a seat.

314
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,760
My house is far away but large.

315
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,439
Don't be wordy when you do good.

316
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,560
I really had a stomachache from drinking last night.

317
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,959
Fortunately, I'm off today.

318
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
My sister worried that you will feel bad after drinking,

319
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,359
so she told me to see you.

320
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,280
She is so kind!

321
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,599
I got a job.

322
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,880
I set up a studio with a friend.

323
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,359
After making a profit,

324
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,319
I'll treat you.

325
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,400
Well done, boy.

326
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,800
Knowing to invite elders to dinner,

327
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:25,719
you deserve praise.

328
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,199
You are not an elder to me.

329
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,359
You've got a bigger temper than two years ago.

330
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,800
I have to say, you look more handsome.

331
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,640
Two years and six months plus three weeks.

332
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,959
You must have many romances in France.

333
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,719
No, I didn't.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,199
I swear to God.

335
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,319
All I think is...

336
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,680
What?

337
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,719
All I think is study.

338
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,119
You are a straight A student. Well done.

339
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,680
I was drunk last night.

340
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,040
I even forget how I came back.

341
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,839
My sister asked me to drive you home.

342
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,319
Seriously?

343
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,560
It's you?

344
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,040
That's why I know you may feel bad after drinking.

345
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,839
-So I bought you congee. -That's okay.

346
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:23,839
Xiaopang.

347
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,439
Take more.

348
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,400
Let's act separately now.

349
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,920
Come on!

350
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:30,640
Fighting!

351
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,239
Hello, handsome boy.

352
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,160
Meeting Your Match.

353
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,479
Please have a look, thanks.

354
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,160
OK.

355
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,599
Please have a look.

356
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,280
Please have a look, bro.

357
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,959
OK.

358
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,199
Let me do it.

359
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:46,880
What's this?

360
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,479
Please have a look, handsome boy.

361
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,160
You're the person we want.

362
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,839
Welcome to join us!

363
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,599
Handsome boy, I think you should try.

364
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,920
Everything is going well here.

365
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
I'll check over there.

366
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,239
Zip up to look more energetic.

367
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,959
When you get on and off the horse,

368
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,239
be careful please.

369
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,560
Not this one.

370
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,800
Change to this shirt.

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,479
OK.

372
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,400
Qingyou.

373
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,119
Bad news.

374
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,319
The guest of Career Hero missed our appointment.

375
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,160
What about the candidate?

376
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,280
No one.

377
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,239
Alright, don't worry.

378
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,760
Let other guests go for the shooting first.

379
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,640
Think about that is there anyone suitable around us

380
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,400
who can understudy?

381
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,479
We've been looking for

382
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,199
more than a week

383
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,119
to find the man.

384
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,640
Suddenly...

385
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,280
I'll call for help.

386
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,319
Actually...

387
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,959
Just say it, what's your idea?

388
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,160
Actually, there's a great candidate.

389
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,040
Who?

390
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,880
Don't you think Mr. Mo is suitable?

391
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,719
Impossible.

392
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,280
But now it's too difficult

393
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,199
to find someone suitable.

394
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,599
And what if Mr. Mo agrees?

395
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,520
Qingyou.

396
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,040
Why don't you call him first?

397
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,800
No way.

398
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,280
Hello, Mr. Mo.

399
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,079
This is Xu Qingyou.

400
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,239
Are you busy now?

401
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,160
Well.

402
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,319
Now we are

403
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,680
making promotional film for Meeting Your Match.

404
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,000
Are you interested in joining us?

405
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,680
Didn't you say my standard is too high to meet?

406
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,760
It's only a few days.

407
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,000
Am I degraded?

408
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,119
Don't tell like this.

409
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,640
You condescend to simple men.

410
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,280
Whatever,

411
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,880
We need your help.

412
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,160
Besides,

413
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,000
as the investor of Lemi,

414
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:43,199
I think it's good for both sides.

415
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,560
You'll help, won't you?

416
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,040
Director Xu

417
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
The most important thing we do in investing
is careful investigation.

418
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,040
Although you ask me for help,

419
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,959
we have to investigate carefully.

420
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,359
Oh, yeah?

421
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,520
Mr. Mo.

422
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,800
What do you want to ask?

423
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,479
Am I your match?

424
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,920
( Poker face, heartless, match?)

425
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,280
Since you, the producer, has so little faith

426
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,319
in me,

427
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm really not suitable for the role.

428
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,439
I refuse.

429
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,520
Wait.

430
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:21,760
Sure you are.

431
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,280
Sorry.

432
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm having a meeting.

433
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,439
I can't join you.

434
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,199
Hello? Hello?

435
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,160
Mo Lingze.

436
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,199
How's it going, Qingyou?

437
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,359
Did Mr. Mo say yes?

438
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,599
Xia Meng.

439
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,079
You keep staying at the scene.

440
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,119
Dong Bao.

441
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,239
Keep looking for a candidate.

442
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,199
The shooting task must be finished today.

443
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:03,920
Sorry.

444
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Director Xu, I can't.

445
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,839
Wait, director.

446
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,319
D...

447
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,479
Qingyou.

448
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,000
Can you ask the director to lower his standards a little?

449
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,359
It's really...

450
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,680
Discuss with the director nicely.

451
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,599
Wait, director.

452
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,599
I can't do this.

453
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,280
I told you.

454
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,800
Director, director.

455
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,839
Do us a favor, director.

456
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,880
The sun went away.

457
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,319
The sun went away, and the actors went away.

458
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,439
Where is the actor?

459
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,439
Qingyou.

460
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,400
Director.

461
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,000
We have the best styling team.

462
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,640
Maybe you make some improvements

463
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,280
in lighting, photography and modeling?

464
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,800
OK, OK.

465
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,160
Go find other directors to do this.

466
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,119
I can't.

467
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,479
Director.

468
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,040
Wait a second.

469
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Clothing, come on.

470
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Tidy up the collar.

471
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,880
Director, please let her do this.

472
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:44,839
No problem.

473
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,959
Thank you for coming to help.

474
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:00,839
Director Xu.

475
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,719
I'm penny-pinching.

476
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,839
I price my services by the second.

477
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,119
Good.

478
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,640
I never owe others.

479
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,479
OK, not bad, huh?

480
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,359
Very good.

481
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:37,839
Thank you.

482
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,599
OK, thanks.

483
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,520
Let's call it a day.

484
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,239
Thank you.

485
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,280
Have a rest.

486
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:44,920
OK.

487
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,040
Let's take a look at the photos.

488
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,119
Thanks, Mr. Mo.

489
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,239
Is Director Xu satisfied

490
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,000
with my performance today?

491
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,319
Sure, nice job.

492
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
How to show your appreciation?

493
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,719
Well, I will treat you to a big meal.

494
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:02,760
Alright.

495
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,479
Director Xu.

496
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,839
Is this the big meal you said?

497
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,719
Why isn't this a big meal?

498
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,560
This is my secret base.

499
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,040
I don't tell others easily.

500
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,439
Are you a regular here?

501
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,680
When I was young, my parents were too busy

502
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,520
to cook for my brother and me.

503
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,280
We were both poor at that time.

504
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,119
So,

505
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,119
we could only buy three kebabs,

506
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,199
and tuck the meat into the cake. It tastes good.

507
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:40,880
I understand.

508
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,280
Childhood fine food.

509
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,280
What's your childhood fine food?

510
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,160
I can't remember.

511
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,199
Don't look down on this place.

512
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,319
This is a famous energy supply station.

513
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,800
Whenever I am busy and tired,

514
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,400
and exhausted,

515
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,520
looking at the surrounding people,

516
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,239
they work till midnight like me,

517
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,160
and work hard overtime,

518
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,800
I was refreshed,

519
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,160
just like being doped.

520
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,640
Staying up late is okay.

521
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,160
If other employees are like you,

522
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,560
Mr. Zhai is the winner.

523
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,599
I worked for those who pay me.

524
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,839
Isn't you?

525
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,520
I spend money for others.

526
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,560
Too spicy.

527
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,439
Hello, Mr. Zhai.

528
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,319
Qingyou.

529
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,760
As for the advertising of promotional film 
of Meeting Your Match,

530
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,920
how's it going now?

531
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,880
Online advertising has been confirmed,

532
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,239
but offline advertising needs to be reconfirmed.

533
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,839
Offline advertising is so important,

534
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,119
but you put it last?

535
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,119
Be sure to confirm the plan tonight,

536
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,239
and send to me for review.

537
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,959
Please rest assured.

538
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,880
I'll work on it now.

539
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,160
Okay.

540
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,160
I think you are a dangerous person.

541
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Why?

542
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,560
You are thoughtful.

543
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,640
I'm not on the same level with you.

544
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,199
what do you mean?
