3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,120
Fang Qi.

4
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,760
Do you see any difference in your home?

5
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,760
There is nothing special.

6
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,400
Wait a moment.

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Please take a good look.

8
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,599
It's about lights.

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,120
Oh, yeah.

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,760
Where are the lampshades of these two lights?

11
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,839
You did it, right?

12
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,240
It has nothing to do with me.

13
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,479
I didn't move the lampshades.

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,240
Hey,

15
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,320
are you okay?

16
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,919
How much did you drink? You're going to throw up.

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,080
You even want to drink ice Coke!

18
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,279
What do you know about it?

19
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,919
Ice Coke is the right choice after drinking.

20
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,039
Leave me alone.

21
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,320
I mean, ice Coke is bad for your stomach.

22
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,559
You've drunk so much.

23
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Kid, don't tell me what to do.

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,559
I'll make you some ginger tea.

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,080
Drinking too much is bad for your stomach.

26
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,119
Drinking ginger tea can warm your stomach.

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,720
Have a good sleep after drinking ginger tea.

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,279
What are you doing?

29
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,240
I want to wipe your face with a hot towel.

30
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:14,759
To wipe my face?

31
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,759
Don't wipe my makeup off.

32
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,000
How do you sleep with makeup?

33
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,320
I want to be like Sleeping Beauty

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
and sleep beautifully, okay?

35
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,919
Fine, as you like.

36
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,479
Who allowed you to leave?

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,800
Who allowed you to leave?

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,240
You are handsome.

39
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,880
Although you're handsome,

40
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,000
I can only appreciate from a distance,

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,080
rather than...

42
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,240
Why did you drink?

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,479
Because...

44
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,720
I won't tell you.

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,399
Xu Qingyou, are you avoiding me?

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,160
You know what?

47
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,639
Now that you've scratched a "Thank",

48
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,039
then there will be no follow-up.

49
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:12,360
Fang Qi wants me to ask you the reason.

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,639
Why should I? I have self-esteem, too.

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,760
As for a man like you,

52
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,760
I won't seriously develop relationships.

53
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,000
What do you mean?

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,600
You hurt me.

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,399
Didn't you say you could only appreciate 
from a distance?

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,640
You can only appreciate from a distance,

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,720
but I can...

58
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,359
Xu Qingyou.

59
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,839
Too much salt for dinner.

60
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,359
So that's the light he was talking about.

61
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,559
I guessed for quite a while.

62
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,750
(Ginger tea can warm your stomach. Drink it.
From lovely and charming Xu Wei)

63
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,119
Fang Qi.

64
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:36,600
You...

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,359
Are you awake, or have you waked up yet?

66
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,079
I just woke up.

67
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,079
You don't sleep in the midnight,

68
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,320
what are you doing downstairs?

69
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,519
I'm looking for inspiration for painting.

70
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,359
Let me heat ginger tea for you.

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,279
Go to bed after you drink.

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,799
Or you'll be unhappy with dark circles tomorrow.

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't bother.

74
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,959
That's enough for me.

75
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,519
Have a seat, let's chat for a while.

76
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,959
This light is beautiful.

77
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,600
Did you notice that?

78
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,519
I'm not blind.

79
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,679
Do you like it?

80
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,600
Not bad.

81
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,600
Not bad? Does it mean you like it or not?

82
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,880
Just take it literally.

83
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,359
Why are you so wordy?

84
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,880
Then you don't like it.

85
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,320
I'll take it down.

86
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,959
How dare you?

87
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,320
You said it was not bad,

88
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,920
which means not good, doesn't it?

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,119
Are you asking for trouble?

90
00:07:59,119 --> 00:07:59,959
You little brat.

91
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,279
Don't do this.

92
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,359
Go easy on the alcohol later on.

93
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
You feel sick every time you drink too much.

94
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,359
What's more, don't drink iced beverage anymore.

95
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,720
After drinking, you can drink some hot water,

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
or I'll make you some ginger tea.

97
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,040
-You should go to bed later. -I know.

98
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,040
Or there will be dark circles tomorrow.

99
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,559
You're right.

100
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,760
You will be unhappy every time you have dark circles.

101
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Mr. Mo?

102
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,679
Mr. Mo?

103
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Mr. Mo?

104
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,920
(Clean the room)

105
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,599
I had a meeting all morning,

106
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm dying of thirst.

107
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,960
Are you okay when you went home yesterday?

108
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,880
Yeah, I'm okay.

109
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840
Fortunately, you didn't make any trouble.

110
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Otherwise, I dare not

111
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
let you drink so much wine later.

112
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,760
Yeah.

113
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,599
Yes, Mr. Zhai.

114
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,159
Eve is going to sign today.

115
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,640
I'll meet him.

116
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,880
Director Xu, have you sobered up?

117
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,440
Thanks, Mr. Mo.

118
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,719
You are welcome, Director Xu.

119
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,200
Qingyou, why don't you get in?

120
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,440
Hello, Mr. Mo.

121
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:46,559
Mr. Mo, did you hurt your hand?

122
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,320
Last night, my cat lost her temper

123
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,520
and scratched my hand.

124
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Now is the rutting time for cats,

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,479
they're too grumpy.

126
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,760
-Take care of yourself.
-The live-streaming is about to start.

127
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,640
Come in.

128
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:05,599
Hello,

129
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,000
dear friends, nice to see you!

130
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,960
Welcome to our Live Streaming Studio.

131
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,760
Today we will recommend a precious product to you.

132
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,919
What is it?

133
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,640
As for this product,

134
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
it's really a good thing I like to use recently.

135
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,520
Yeah, let's first...

136
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,159
Director Xu.

137
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
I'm Eve's music producer.

138
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,359
Nice to meet you.

139
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,239
Nice to meet you.

140
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,719
Eve's joining in Lyuluo's

141
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,400
last live streaming was good.

142
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,719
We still need your support.

143
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Who's this?

144
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,799
This is Mr. Mo of Shangger Capital.

145
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,640
So you are Mr. Mo.

146
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Nice to meet you.

147
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm Eve's music producer.

148
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,960
Thank you so much for your appreciation of Eve.

149
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,119
You are welcome.

150
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,159
If you have to, just thank Director Xu.

151
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,159
Thanks to Director Xu's unique vision.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,520
Sure.

153
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,200
If it's convenient at night,

154
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,400
let me treat you to dinner.

155
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,119
It's on me.

156
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,239
For an excellent producer like you,

157
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:55,679
we need your support.

158
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,039
If you like.

159
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,719
Today's live streaming should have a good response.

160
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,559
Have a seat.

161
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,159
What would you like to eat?

162
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,400
It's fine with me. Up to you.

163
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,359
How about Japanese food?

164
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,119
Good.

165
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,760
I know a new Japanese food restaurant with good taste.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,039
And last time I...

167
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,840
Get in, Director Xu.

168
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,760
There's something urgent for you to deal with.

169
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,440
Excuse me,

170
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,679
I have plans today.

171
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,760
And I remember,

172
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,479
my work is not arranged by Mr. Mo.

173
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,320
It's your work.

174
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,000
Sure,

175
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,679
your work is more important.

176
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,239
We can make another appointment for dinner.

177
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,000
It's okay.

178
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,679
Sorry for that.

179
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, Qingyou,

180
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,359
keep in touch with me.

181
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,880
Of course.

182
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,280
OK.

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,559
Goodbye.

184
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,640
Qingyou?

185
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,119
What's the matter, Mr. Mo?

186
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,239
Is there anything wrong?

187
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
You went out early today,

188
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,000
you haven't cleaned the room yet, Qingyou?

189
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,679
That's what you said about the work arrangement?

190
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,679
This is your responsibility.

191
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,119
Are you kidding me?

192
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,640
Do you think I'm kidding you?

193
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,719
I'm preparing a merger recently,

194
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,479
they are both big companies in the business world.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,320
No mistakes are allowed.

196
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,520
So?

197
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,719
As an investor,

198
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,239
living under such high pressure,

199
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:24,440
a clean, tidy and comfortable living environment

200
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,239
is important.

201
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,200
There is no need to teach you, right?

202
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,039
Get in the car now.

203
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Right now.

204
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,080
Do you want this?

205
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,159
I'll get the seasoning first, I'll be right back.

206
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,000
Go ahead.

207
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,840
Leave me the shopping cart.

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,159
What if there's too much to fit?

209
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,119
Carry it in your clothes.

210
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
Are you stupid? Hurry up.

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
Beef roll.

212
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,410
(From now on, please take care of me)

213
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:22,640
Not finished yet?

214
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,599
No need to choose.

215
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
I'll take all of these.

216
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,840
I think all are delicious.

217
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,840
What else would you like to eat?

218
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,159
Mr. Mo, you're back.

219
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,359
Aunt Li, you can leave.

220
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,400
Leave the rest to her.

221
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,840
There is already a cleaner here,

222
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,919
why do you ask me to do this?

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Because you messed up the room,

224
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,919
cleaning is your duty.

225
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,840
What's more,

226
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
the room is full of trade secrets,

227
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,679
who's responsible if they are lost?

228
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,599
You have so many trade secrets,

229
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,000
aren't you afraid I'll lose them?

230
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,840
Director Xu is careful and cautious,

231
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:02,799
I trust you.

232
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,559
OK, no problem.

233
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,719
Auntie, let me do this.

234
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,359
Thank you.

235
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,039
Mr. Mo, then I'll leave.

236
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:19,320
Thank you.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,559
Since you have so many trade secrets,

238
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,679
you clean the bedroom,

239
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,400
and I clean the sofa.

240
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,280
What are you doing?

241
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,039
I want to ask you.

242
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,280
About what?

243
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,440
I've told you a lot of things.

244
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,359
Then tell me again.

245
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,159
What would you like to know?

246
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,440
You said you wouldn't be serious about me.

247
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,719
What kind of person am I?

248
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,599
Are you not serious or am I?

249
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,400
I am serious.

250
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,919
It's you.

251
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,559
So you admit you're serious about me, right?

252
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,119
Yeah, I thought about it.

253
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:03,679
Mr. Mo, since we didn't start,

254
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
let's bring it to an end.

255
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,400
Why?

256
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,640
I want to play it safe,

257
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,239
but you are a trap.

258
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,760
I don't want to be silly again.

259
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,400
Do you have any misunderstanding about me, 
Xu Qingyou?

260
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,799
There is no misunderstanding.

261
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,440
Then why do you think I'm a trap?

262
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,599
You expressed your love out of the desire to win.

263
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,840
You take action out of possessiveness.

264
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,280
You are such a dangerous person.

265
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,599
I can't afford it,

266
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,159
but I can avoid at least.

267
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,799
Let's keep a distance.

268
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,039
So, you've studied me

269
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,400
very thoroughly, huh?

270
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,400
Have I?

271
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,719
Thanks for your affirmation, Mr. Mo.

272
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,479
Hello?

273
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
I got it.

274
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,200
Mr. Mo, I have something else to do.

275
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,200
As for the cleaning fee,

276
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,280
I'll transfer it to you.

277
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,110
(Wechat Pay: 200 yuan to Mo Lingze)

278
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:39,880
Your stomach is not good,

279
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,959
don't you know that?

280
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,199
You eat hot pot while drinking iced beverage.

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,280
What happened?

282
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
What's wrong with me?

283
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,160
Since you took a look

284
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,680
at your cell phone in the supermarket,

285
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,760
there's something wrong with you.

286
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,920
What do you say?

287
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,280
Qu Kai is getting married.

288
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,239
He showed his love in his WeChat Moments.

289
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,000
When we were together,

290
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,520
he has never shown our affection.

291
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,119
I feel so bad.

292
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,560
All right?

293
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,599
His marriage is not a big deal.

294
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,520
For a man like him,

295
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,640
it's not worth hurting your body.

296
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,719
I told you

297
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,760
to make you shut up and eat,

298
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,520
instead of teaching me, okay?

299
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,839
Please don't get me wrong.

300
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,520
I mean, if you can't forget him,

301
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,599
you can't move on.

302
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,160
Who said I couldn't forget this guy?

303
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,599
Don't act like you know me well

304
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,599
and tell me what to do.

305
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,280
Mind your own business and just eat.

306
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,239
Are you okay?

307
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,680
Why are you so careless when eating?

308
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,959
It's none of your business.

309
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,800
Turn the fire down or the soup will splash.

310
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,200
(Southern Medical University Hospital) 

311
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,439
Youyou.

312
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Thank you for coming today.

313
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
It was the least I could do.

314
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,280
Youyou.

315
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,959
About our breakup,

316
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,760
please don't tell my mother, okay?

317
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,239
I consulted the doctor,

318
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,599
in terms of my mother's current physical condition,

319
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,479
if she knew we broke up,

320
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,680
I'm afraid she couldn't accept it.

321
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,520
Then she couldn't even have an operation then.

322
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
My mother wants to see you anyway,

323
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,160
or she won't even eat.

324
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,640
I'm at my wit's end.

325
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,680
Otherwise I wouldn't bother you.

326
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,520
OK, I'll do as you say.

327
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you.

328
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:36,278
Let's go.

329
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:56,167
Let's go.

330
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,400
My mother is happy to see you.

331
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
She finally ate.

332
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,959
Now she can have a good sleep.

333
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:33,439
I'm not sure

334
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,599
if she doesn't see you
when she wakes up at midnight,

335
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,959
will she want to find you again?

336
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,760
How about this?

337
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,199
I'll accompany her.

338
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
You can feel much relieved.

339
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,520
Thanks, Youyou.

340
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,160
Sir.

341
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,520
Is this seat taken?

342
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:19,760
No.

343
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,479
Lingze, it's me.

344
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,040
It's not easy for me to come,

345
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,280
can't you spend more time with me?

346
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,280
I got plans.

347
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,920
Look at me.

348
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,760
What's different about me today?

349
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,640
My new look.

350
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,439
What about it?

351
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,920
Where are you going?

352
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,079
I'm free, I can accompany you.

353
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
A new comic show has opened,

354
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
would you like to go with me?

355
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,640
No, thanks.

356
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,560
Lingze.

357
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,280
How can you treat me like this?

358
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,239
I am a girl,

359
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,560
it's okay not to be held in the palm of your hand,

360
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,880
you are even unwilling to talk to me.

361
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
Lingze.

362
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,280
If you hate me so much,

363
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,119
it's meaningless for me to live.

364
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,160
I'd better die!

365
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,040
If the meaning of your life is only me,

366
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
that's really unfortunate.

367
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,000
As you wish.

368
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm not stupid.

369
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,760
I haven't seen the latest exhibition and movie yet.

370
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,079
I didn't go to the hottest restaurant I booked either.

371
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
A lot of things I like

372
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,760
haven't been done yet.

373
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,000
And a trip with my friends,

374
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,439
and new friend's birthday party.

375
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,560
I got plans.

376
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,439
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

377
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,239
Lingze, my leg's broken.

378
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,880
I can't move!

379
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,760
I'll do due diligence myself this afternoon.

380
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,280
Pick someone up at the hospital right now.

381
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,199
Leave Shangger if you can't finish it.

382
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,760
Since young, I hate to come to the hospital most.

383
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,479
Every time I would cry and cause trouble.

384
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,400
But now I think

385
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,680
it's happy to come to the hospital.

386
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,760
With your accompany, I'd like to come every day.

387
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,280
Wait, my leg hurts.

388
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,800
Fortunately, it is benign.

389
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,439
But my mother doesn't want to have an operation now.

390
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,599
Youyou, can you help me persuade her?

391
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,680
She'll listen to you.

392
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,640
I...

393
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,400
Lingze, you're walking too fast!

394
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,439
My leg hurts.

395
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,119
Qingyou, Lawyer Fan.

396
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,680
What are you doing in the hospital?

397
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,719
We...

398
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,119
Shouldn't it be for the premarital examination?

399
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,000
No.

400
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,239
I'm here to accompany aunt Fan 
for a physical examination.

401
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,479
Sorry, Qingyou.

402
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,000
I heard you two have been together 
for more than ten years,

403
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
and I thought there would be good news soon.

404
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,119
Miss Lin, what happened to your leg?

405
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,400
I was just dating Lingze

406
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,479
and missed my step by accident.

407
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,839
It's kind of bitterness of love.

408
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:37,560
Oh yeah?

409
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:39,400
Breaking your muscles and bones
takes a hundred days to recover.

410
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,359
Miss Lin, you should have a good rest.

411
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,719
Don't worry.

412
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,520
Lingze is worried about me.

413
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,800
He brought me to the hospital right away.

414
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,520
Are you finished?

415
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,760
I'm waiting for your good news.

416
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,079
I should go, bye.

417
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:24,599
Why?

418
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,760
Why did Lingze leave me?

419
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,719
Please do something.

420
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,920
I want to stay at his house for one night.

421
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,400
Miss Lin.

422
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
Why can't you

423
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,199
change another target instead of Mr. Mo?

424
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,079
You promised me to be an insider,

425
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,199
why betray me now?

426
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,199
I have no choice.

427
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,439
He's my boss.

428
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,959
And as far as I know,

429
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,599
pestering him like this

430
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,520
doesn't work.

431
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,079
You have to change your way.

432
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:53,959
How to change?

433
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,280
You see,

434
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,520
men like to pursue others.

435
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,040
You should control and suppress first, and then let go

436
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,319
to whet the appetite,

437
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,959
and show them

438
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,880
your sense of dignity.

439
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,680
You say I'm not dignified?

440
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,160
Didn't you tell me to lower my profile?

441
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
I mean,

442
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,319
you are not like before.

443
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,479
Show my sense of dignity.

444
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,800
It seems to make sense.

445
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,640
You know what,

446
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,280
you have to let him know

447
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,160
he is not your only choice.

448
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,520
So he can have the desire to win

449
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,319
and turn to you actively.

450
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,479
Wang Ji, good for you.

451
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,000
Men know men best.

452
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:43,959
Such a good way.

453
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,359
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

454
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,680
I...

455
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
I just realized it, too.

456
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,199
Alright.

457
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,319
Drive me home first.

458
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,560
I didn't expect that

459
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,239
Mr. Mo and the princess of Golden Sun are together.

460
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,280
I'll go.

461
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,680
Let me give you a ride.

462
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:10,719
Don't bother.

463
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You stay with auntie Fan.

464
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,199
Youyou.

465
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,719
I know I shouldn't have bothered you.

466
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,040
But at this time,

467
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,839
I really don't know what to do without you.

468
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,520
Only with you by my side

469
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,560
I have the courage to face it.

470
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,319
Auntie Fan is kind to me,

471
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,760
so I should come to see her.

472
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,079
I should go.

473
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,400
Is this a tape?

474
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,599
Eason Chan's.

475
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,599
I saved money to buy it when I was a child.

476
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,319
I have every album of Eason Chan.

477
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,319
You're classic.

478
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,319
Do you still listen to the tape now?

479
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:07,880
I haven't listened for long.

480
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,319
It's not easy to buy a personal stereo now.

481
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,640
Right.

482
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:15,479
It's not the era of

483
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,160
listening to idol's music with a personal stereo.

484
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,959
I keep these tapes

485
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,959
not for listening,

486
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,719
it's more like a sense of ceremony to me.

487
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,160
It preserved the time and energy I spent

488
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,439
on the one I was infatuated with.

489
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,680
These tapes are part of my youth.

490
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,439
They belong to memories,

491
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,880
not to the present.

492
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,640
Who said I couldn't forget this guy?

493
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,640
I just don't want to see people I hate

494
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,400
better than me.

495
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,479
Is this hard to understand?

496
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,920
Don't act like you knowing me well

497
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,880
and tell me what to do.

498
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
Mind your own business.

499
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,239
You have the point.

500
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,370
(Taxi hailing. 49 people waiting before you)

501
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,079
I was just dating Lingze

502
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,000
and missed my step by accident.

503
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,719
Lingze is worried about me.

504
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,199
He brought me to the hospital right away.

505
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,839
It's kind of bitterness of love.

506
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,719
What do you always think about him?

507
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,040
Does he have anything to do with you?

508
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,640
I didn't mean to have anything to do with him,

509
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,439
now there is Miss Lin with him,

510
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,680
don't add trouble anymore.

511
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,760
-Mr. Mo.  -Are you going out such late?

512
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,479
I'll take out the garbage.

513
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,479
Where is the garbage?

514
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,680
Flew away?

515
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,199
It has nothing to do with you.
