3
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,360
What are you doing?

4
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,040
I want to explain it.

5
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,599
I don't like to be misunderstood.

6
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,959
I don't want to know.

7
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,559
What's there to say about the things 
that haven't been sent out?

8
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:06,559
Because of my mom.

9
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,639
My mom used to love making hairy crabs.

10
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,080
I stopped eating after she died.

11
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,559
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,279
I don't know your difficulties.

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,039
Are you all right?

14
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm okay.

15
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,679
Just don't get me wrong.

16
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,279
French DDS Media Company

17
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,279
owns the copyright

18
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,039
of 124 top international sports events.

19
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,119
According to our research and evaluation,

20
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,919
DDS is valued at more than US $1.2 billion.

21
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,839
Many large companies

22
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,320
including Golden Sun Capital

23
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,639
will participate in DDS acquisition.

24
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,600
Lawyer Fan thought of Shangger

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
at the first time.

26
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,440
Thanks to Lawyer Fan,

27
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,600
we Shangger can also

28
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,080
participate in major international projects.

29
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,559
Never mind.

30
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,279
Lawyer Fan

31
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,880
gives us a big deal.

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,679
He has his own purpose.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,800
He acts as a contact in the middle.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,080
Do you know how much commission he can get?

35
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
Conservative estimate,

36
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
tens of millions.

37
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:40,919
As far as I know,

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,479
the copyright of sports events in Europe

39
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,880
is not a permanent license.

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
The contract is signed 
every three to five years on average,

41
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,919
and will be cleared automatically upon expiration.

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,320
In this way,

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
the valuation of 1.2 billion

44
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:50,759
is a little high.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,479
Mr. Mo,

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,639
I'm sure you've heard about that before.

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,000
The previous offer was 1.8 billion.

48
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,559
Now it's 1.2 billion.

49
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
It is already the lowest price.

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,759
DDS let go this time

51
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,160
because their financial situation is extremely unstable.

52
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,600
A loss every three years,

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,880
the risk is very high.

54
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:09,960
Mr. Mo.

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,720
What's your opinion?

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,199
Very simple.

57
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,959
Make a supplementary agreement 
on the basis of the agreement.

58
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,799
If DDS fails to meet the standard 
at the expiration of the agreement,

59
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,880
the investment money will automatically 
be converted into debt.

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,040
DDS is the leading company in the industry.

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,760
After many rounds of negotiation,

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,279
Lawyer Fan won the acquisition index.

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,480
Coupled with the convertible debt

64
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,239
is extremely distrustful of the company,

65
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,160
even an insult.

66
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,200
Mr. Han,

67
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,600
are you talking about feelings?

68
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,839
The DDS acquisition case

69
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,880
is a major event in the industry.

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,519
Many companies are watching.

71
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,920
I think it's an opportunity for Shangger.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
No matter what the result is,

73
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,959
we should have a try.

74
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:57,760
Of course,

75
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
the inflated valuation mentioned by Mr. Mo

76
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,959
is also a problem.

77
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,320
Lawyer Fan,

78
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,320
why don't we try convertible bonds

79
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,920
as Mr. Mo said?

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,839
OK.

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,640
Xiaofang,

82
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,839
do as Mr. Luo said.

83
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,920
Connect with DDS again.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,040
Youyou,

85
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,079
why are you here?

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,359
I'm coming to...

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you come to return my suit?

88
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:56,239
Director Xu.

89
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,679
Please don't have any problems with the clothes

90
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,880
next time you shoot an advertisement.

91
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,239
Okay, I see.

92
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,440
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

93
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,480
Thank you

94
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,200
for helping Youyou.

95
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,119
Never mind.

96
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,519
It's just work.

97
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,399
Youyou,

98
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,920
my mom made pig's trotters soup for you.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,519
It's in my car.

100
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,239
Let's take it.

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,279
Remember to drink it while it is hot.

102
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,079
Take a picture after drinking

103
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,320
to make her happy.

104
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,359
OK.

105
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,679
Tell your mom not to do it.

106
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,119
I'm afraid she's tired.

107
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,320
If you're afraid she's tired,

108
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,559
you'd better marry me earlier.

109
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,640
She'll be happy as long as she sees you.

110
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:51,920
Yunxi,

111
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440
I need some time.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,559
OK.

113
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,640
I know you need time.

114
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,559
I believe this day will come soon.

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,760
All right.

116
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,040
I have to go to work.

117
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,359
Go upstairs.

118
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,679
Be careful on the road.

119
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:22,559
Bye.

120
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,119
Director Xu,

121
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,720
why did you feel guilty just now?

122
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Nothing.

123
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,440
I just don't want to make trouble.

124
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,519
I've helped you so much.

125
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,239
Don't you thank me?

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,880
Thank you.

127
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,200
You're welcome.

128
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,679
Isn't it always

129
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,320
Director Xu's demand to keep secrets?

130
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,600
I hope you can pay attention to what you say.

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,359
Pay attention to what?

132
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
Pay attention to our relationship.

133
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,760
Fan Yunxi is my boyfriend.

134
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,920
So?

135
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,079
So I said

136
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,720
don't cause unnecessary trouble.

137
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,640
You think I'm a problem.

138
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:20,640
Yeah,

139
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,279
a big trouble.

140
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,480
Do you think

141
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,239
I'll bring you more trouble?

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,760
Fang Qi,

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,719
I wait for you to send Moments every day.

144
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,919
I saved all your photos

145
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,640
and drew this picture album for you.

146
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to give it to you.

147
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,880
Why are you here?

148
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,239
What are you doing?

149
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,559
I'm preparing clothes for tomorrow's blind date.

150
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,559
I just take out the garbage. It's smelly.

151
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,400
Blind date?

152
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,719
Why do you want a blind date?

153
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,760
Don't you like someone?

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
Who says I love someone?

155
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
From my observation.

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Don't you like someone in secret?

157
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:38,119
Unrequited love at such age?

158
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm not eighteen.

159
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,719
If I like someone,

160
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:41,880
I will tell the world.

161
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,440
I'm afraid of being taken away by others.

162
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,000
What the hell is this?

163
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,440
I bought it by the side of the road.

164
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,599
Please help me to pick one.

165
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:52,799
Which looks better?

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,000
Neither looks good.

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,119
Come on. Bye.

168
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,039
Mr. Zhai.

169
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,520
Youyou,

170
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,000
Lawyer Fan

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,359
sued Lemi.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
I don't know.

173
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,280
Maybe he wants to surprise you.

174
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,200
You have a good talk with him.

175
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,799
I can't afford to offend him.

176
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,640
Okay, I'll talk to him.

177
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,840
(Civil Procedure)

178
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,599
(Civil Procedure)
What's going on?

179
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,230
(Civil Procedure)

180
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,320
I want to help you.

181
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,960
They want to lay off employees improperly.

182
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,520
Then I'll put some pressure on them in my way.

183
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,039
Sue my company in my name.

184
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,640
Have you discussed this matter with me?

185
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,880
I said

186
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,520
I just put pressure on them.

187
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,280
I'm not really going to sue them.

188
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,359
I was going to tell you.

189
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,000
I forgot because I'm busy.

190
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,599
Are you angry?

191
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,119
Things have passed.

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,239
Drop the lawsuit as soon as possible.

193
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,599
What's wrong with you today?

194
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,919
I just think

195
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,119
you should discuss with me

196
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,520
before you do everything.

197
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,479
I didn't discuss with you before.

198
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,840
Are you still blaming me

199
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,200
for that?

200
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,039
I need some time to get used to it.

201
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,520
Then you adjust yourself as soon as possible.

202
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,960
I really don't hope our feelings

203
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,000
stand still.

204
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,960
Okay?

205
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,159
I have to go.

206
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
Look at these pictures.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,119
So handsome.

208
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,719
He's so cool.

209
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,239
Is this a good shot?

210
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,679
Extremely perfect!

211
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,159
How about this one?

212
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,679
They all look good.

213
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,719
This one.

214
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,359
Right?

215
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,679
Do you think

216
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
I'll bring you more trouble?

217
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,799
I don't know how to choose.

218
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,200
I don't think so.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,359
You don't think it's good.

220
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,479
Do we need to remake it?

221
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,119
Youyou.

222
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,239
Youyou,

223
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,080
are you asking too much?

224
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
This is quite nice.

225
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,919
The commercial film of Meeting Your Match

226
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,919
will be online soon.

227
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,440
Work hard to check all.

228
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,039
What about the live broadcast and filming?

229
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,280
Leave it to me.

230
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,119
Look at it again.

231
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,000
OK.

232
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:55,520
OK.

233
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,799
What's wrong with being so handsome?

234
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,960
It's nice. Very cool.

235
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,599
She's too strict. Yeah.

236
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,799
Mr. Mo, are you in the company?

237
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,000
I want to talk to you about something.

238
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:10,880
He thought I'd back down.

239
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,159
The subscriber you dialed is busy.

240
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,039
Please redial later.

241
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,440
All the information about

242
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
the impromptu meeting next Monday

243
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,960
should be sent to Mr. Mo's mailbox this Friday.

244
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,840
Have you sent it yet?

245
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,239
I forgot if you didn't remind me.

246
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,440
I'll get ready.

247
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,760
Director Xu,

248
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,599
why are you here?

249
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,280
What's the matter?

250
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,400
Can I eat you?

251
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,359
Where's Mr. Mo?

252
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,119
He is not here.

253
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,640
Not here?

254
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,679
Really?

255
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,159
I swear.

256
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,450
(Schedule)

257
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:02,320
It doesn't matter if he's not here.

258
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,799
I'm not looking for him anyway.

259
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,400
Don't look for him?

260
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,039
Yes.

261
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm looking for Fang Qi.

262
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,080
Bring her something.

263
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,880
It was here just now.

264
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,960
Why can't I find it?

265
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,039
Give me a hand.

266
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,960
Hold it for me.

267
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,320
Quickly.

268
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,880
Where was it?

269
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,440
Where?

270
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,159
Excuse me. Excuse me.

271
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,620
(7AM-8AM: swimming)

272
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,559
Mr. Mo likes swimming.

273
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,559
We are in the investment business

274
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,359
and must have good physical strength.

275
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,159
We need to do sports.

276
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,320
OK.

277
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,119
Got it.

278
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:35,919
I'm leaving.

279
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,760
Director Xu,

280
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,159
what about your things for Fang Qi?

281
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,200
Mr. Mo.

282
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,719
Why are you here?

283
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,880
You're so strict with yourself

284
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,039
besides work.

285
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,840
We should learn from you.

286
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,440
You're not coming to talk to me about work, are you?

287
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,679
Every second counts.

288
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,880
Let's talk here.

289
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,359
You don't care about the popularity of advertising.

290
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,520
Why do you care about me?

291
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,080
You are the heat.

292
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,760
We saw the commercials

293
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
and did data analysis.

294
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,039
Between twenty-two and thirty-four seconds,

295
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,320
it reached the peak of data.

296
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,799
And these twelve seconds are the time when you appear.

297
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,479
Mr. Mo,

298
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,400
the data analysis of Meeting Your Match

299
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,000
has come out.

300
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,280
You are the favorite of netizens.

301
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,760
It is very important for Lemi.

302
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,239
I hope you can do us this favor.

303
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,200
Do a favor?

304
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,280
You're not afraid of trouble now.

305
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,039
That's my job.

306
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,039
Yeah.

307
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,679
This is your job.

308
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,320
What does it have to do with me?

309
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:13,799
Mr. Mo,

310
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
you can just say

311
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,000
how on earth can you help us.

312
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,799
Then I'd like to ask you.

313
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,960
What are you willing to do

314
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,239
to get my help?

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,560
Thank you.

316
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,959
I seem to hear this sentence often.

317
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,719
This is what I owe you.

318
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,160
I'll pay it back.

319
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,280
Xu Qingyou,

320
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,800
do you have to tell everything so clearly?

321
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:39,920
This is my principle.

322
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,040
What about the live broadcast?

323
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,400
Aren't you afraid to owe me more?

324
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:45,920
I...

325
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,839
Answer cautiously.

326
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,439
Your reply may decide whether I answer or not.

327
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,800
I know.

328
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,520
But I made a pledge.

329
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,719
This promotion

330
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,119
is really important to our team.

331
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,160
I don't want to affect my team

332
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,599
because our personal affairs.

333
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,920
I will definitely pay back the favor

334
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,280
in my own way.

335
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,959
It's impossible.

336
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,599
My observation is absolutely correct.

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,439
Do you know how sad I am to lose hope?

338
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,719
It's better to have no hope in the first place.

339
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,079
This is

340
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,920
worse than waiting in Paris

341
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,199
for four years.

342
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,640
I see.

343
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,880
Let's figure out how many years 
you have had a crush on her.

344
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,000
One year, two years...

345
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,520
You have loved her for so many years 
and haven't confessed.

346
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,400
She doesn't like me.

347
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,760
How to confess?

348
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,119
She doesn't like you.

349
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,719
Then you should try your best

350
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,680
to make her like you.

351
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,800
That's what it's like to chase girls.

352
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,319
Do you want to

353
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,479
watch her blind date succeed,

354
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,880
then have a wedding,

355
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,719
but the groom is not you?

356
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,800
What should I do now?

357
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Destroy her blind date,

358
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,319
of course.

359
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,920
Miss Fang,

360
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,319
do you mind if I have a child?

361
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,280
I read your information just now.

362
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,160
You are also divorced.

363
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:26,560
But it doesn't matter.

364
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,359
I don't mind.

365
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,359
You see,

366
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,400
we have a common experience.

367
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,760
Then I'll go first.

368
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,479
Think about it.

369
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,000
Hello.

370
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,160
I'm in a hurry.

371
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,359
Let me get this straight.

372
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,680
You don't  need to do dishwashing 
and cooking in my family.

373
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,520
Nanny can do these.

374
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,599
What I need now is someone 
who can give birth to children.

375
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,839
Two children in three years.

376
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,719
It would be better if they were all boys.

377
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,479
I'll give you one of my two villas.

378
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,199
Think about it.

379
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,520
Mom, let me show you this girl.

380
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,079
I like this one very much.

381
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,400
I've been watching her for a long time, mom.

382
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,760
Come on.

383
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,160
This is my mother. Hello.

384
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,599
Hello. Can she cook?

385
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,400
I haven't asked yet.

386
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
Mom, I'll ask for you later.

387
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
I got it. I got it, mom.

388
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,119
I see.

389
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,439
You must know about her family background.

390
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,680
Wait a minute, mom.

391
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
You need to make it clear.

392
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:13,760
Hello,

393
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,479
here are my various certificates.

394
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,520
Have a look.

395
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,239
This...

396
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm sorry about that.

397
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,479
This, this is...

398
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,359
What are you doing here?

399
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm on a blind date.

400
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,119
What are you doing?

401
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,079
My sister called me here 
because she was worried about you.

402
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,319
She's afraid you are fooled. Come on.

403
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,599
Fine.

404
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,640
You're so good.

405
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:45,880
Why do you come on a blind date?

406
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:55,760
Go away.

407
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,280
This one...

408
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,880
This is my brother.

409
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,400
Go quickly. It's not suitable for children.

410
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,400
Hello,

411
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,239
I'll introduce myself first.

412
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,839
I have six properties now.

413
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,760
Hello,

414
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,359
what's your name?

415
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,400
You don't have to worry about 
the financial situation at all.

416
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,680
What do you do?

417
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,479
You just need to

418
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,920
enjoy life at home.

419
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,680
What's the difference 
between this and the unemployed?

420
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,680
And then...

421
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,319
I think it's quite good.

422
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:26,760
Right?

423
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
And then

424
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,599
my mother cares more

425
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,079
about education.

426
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,800
Hello,

427
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,079
I'll introduce myself first.

428
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm a Ph.D. student at Medical University.

429
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,560
It takes a long time to

430
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
learn this major.

431
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,280
So it delayed finding a lover.

432
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
I am a doctor she trained.

433
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,280
Like primary school level.

434
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,959
You are too disrespectful!

435
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,119
No.

436
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,439
Then

437
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,319
let's go out and have a chat.

438
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:50,959
OK.

439
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,520
This way.

440
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,000
Go.

441
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,760
It would be nice if you didn't mind I have children.

442
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,359
I like children.

443
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:05,439
This project is really wonderful.

444
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,359
I like this one.

445
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,359
This project was born for Mr. Mo.

446
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,959
Qingyou.

447
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,839
What are you looking at?

448
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,199
Our advertisement

449
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,520
can be put on tonight.

450
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,199
Qingyou,

451
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,959
why don't you invite Yunxi

452
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:19,920
to make a guest appearance?

453
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:21,959
He is very busy.

454
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,880
To tell the truth,

455
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,719
it's really good.

456
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,280
The first round of launch will start tonight.

457
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,119
Fighting.

458
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,400
Don't worry.

459
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,439
OK.

460
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,439
See you.

461
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,680
Bye, Mr. Zhai.

462
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,079
Qingyou,

463
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
I was going to

464
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,800
check the advertising with you

465
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,359
this evening.

466
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,640
But it suddenly occurred to me 
that I had a classmate meeting.

467
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,119
So...

468
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:41,760
Well.

469
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,359
I see.

470
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,160
Thank you, Qingyou.

471
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,959
By the way,

472
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,000
here's a tip for you.

473
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,000
The viewing platform opposite

474
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,000
has a much clearer view than ours.

475
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,000
OK.

476
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,560
This restaurant is delicious.

477
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Let's come again next time.

478
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,880
We'll eat it another day.

479
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,239
Don't invite me to your house?

480
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,119
I live alone.

481
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,800
We don't know each other very well yet.

482
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,000
Maybe next time.

483
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,199
You've been married to someone.

484
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,479
Is it necessary to pretend to be pure?

485
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
What are you talking about?

486
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,400
You really think of yourself as a little girl?

487
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,560
Are you crazy?

488
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,959
I will absolutely beat you!

489
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,040
Just leave the trash to me.

490
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,319
You...

491
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,119
Xu Wei.

492
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Leave it alone.

493
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,319
I thought I met Mr. Right.

494
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,800
I didn't expect him to be a trash.

495
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,599
I'm almost thirty.

496
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:01,160
Why can't I meet a good person?

497
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,560
It doesn't matter.

498
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,439
You're so smart and beautiful.

499
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,000
You have a good job, high income,

500
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,000
and your own house.

501
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,520
You can buy bag for yourself.

502
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,000
Your value

503
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,439
is beyond your age.

504
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,040
Why do you care if you have a boyfriend?

505
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
What you just said

506
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,079
is absolutely right.

507
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,680
So

508
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,599
ever since I got divorced,

509
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,000
I never thought about getting married again.

510
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,719
But

511
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,839
Qu Kai is getting married.

512
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,599
Qu Kai,

513
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,160
your ex-husband?

514
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,719
He found a young and beautiful one.

515
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,760
Then I have to find one, too.

516
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,719
I have to find someone

517
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:01,680
who is more handsome, richer

518
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,719
and better to me than him.

519
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,319
So

520
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,359
this is why you...

521
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,319
Have one.

522
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,439
I just got pills and can't drink.

523
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,439
I finally got off work. I have an appointment today.

524
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,160
Qingyou,

525
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,680
I'm leaving first.

526
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,359
OK.

527
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,079
Bye.

528
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,079
Go back early.

529
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:27,560
Bye.

530
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,400
Bye.

531
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,400
Bye.

532
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,319
Bye.

533
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,040
Bye, Qingyou.

534
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,719
Go home early.

535
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,359
Bye.

536
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,319
Please check this data again.

537
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,280
Look here, let's compare it.

538
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,510
(Meet Your Match)

539
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,000
Why is the power out in the building opposite?

540
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,239
I heard that Director Xu is

541
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,319
checking the advertising.

542
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,439
Make a phone call and ask her.

543
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,520
OK.

544
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Hello, Yunxi.

545
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,920
Are you off now?

546
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,239
Not yet.

547
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,280
What's wrong with you? Where are you?

548
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm on the viewing platform opposite the company.

549
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,479
I'm checking the company's advertising.

550
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,359
Unexpectedly, there was a sudden power failure here.

551
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,079
Hello?

552
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,119
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

553
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,599
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

554
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,199
Who is it?

555
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,640
Me.

556
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:57,880
Mr. Mo,

557
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:58,719
why are you here?

558
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,239
Check advertising.

559
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,760
If there's anything wrong with the ad,

560
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
I'm the one who lost.

561
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,400
It's power cut suddenly.

562
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,199
But the ad is OK.

563
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,400
Thank you.

564
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,400
What's wrong with your foot?

565
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:25,959
I just tweaked it.

566
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,319
Nothing.

567
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,640
I'm fine.

568
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,199
Don't move.

569
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,839
It doesn't matter.

570
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,800
Go back and put some ice on it.

571
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:57,959
It will be okay the next day.

572
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,479
Okay, I see.

573
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,359
What's going on?

574
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,160
I'm doing Power Point.

575
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,959
Why is the power out suddenly?

576
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,280
I'm really sorry.

577
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,239
We are repairing the circuit now.

578
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,040
It will be all right soon.

579
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,400
Hurry up!

580
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,319
I'm really sorry.

581
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,199
Hello, what's going on here?

582
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,280
Suddenly, the power went out.

583
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,160
The elevator didn't work either.

584
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,280
Where is the viewing platform?

585
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,920
The twentieth floor.

586
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:47,760
Thanks.

587
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,599
Never mind.

588
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,359
Hurry up, hurry up.

589
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,000
Hello.

590
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,040
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

591
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,920
Please redial later.

592
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:17,719
Be careful.

593
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:18,359
It doesn't matter.

594
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,160
Go.

595
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,239
Mr. Mo,

596
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:44,439
stop here.

597
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:45,920
In short,

598
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,119
thank you today.

599
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,760
Is there anything else to say?

600
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,040
Come to me tomorrow 
to check the live broadcast process.

601
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,359
Thank you.

602
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,479
Never mind.

603
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,160
Let's go.

604
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,280
Yunxi.

605
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,439
Youyou,

606
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,560
are you all right?

607
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,000
I heard there was a power failure and came right away.

608
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,520
But your phone has been disconnected.

609
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,760
The phone is dead.

610
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:25,839
It's all right now.

611
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,040
Mr. Mo,

612
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,439
why are you here?

613
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,959
Why can't I be here?
