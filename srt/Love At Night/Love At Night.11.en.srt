=Episode 11=

3
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:33,800
Well.

4
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:35,360
Look,

5
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,000
this interview is quite good.

6
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,760
Have you finished?

7
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,360
Yes.

8
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,040
In particular, these two parts must not go wrong.

9
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,760
OK.

10
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
You should prepare the live content

11
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,839
and props.

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,559
Got it.

13
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,279
Lyuluo.

14
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:51,760
Qingyou.

15
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,480
How is it?

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,919
Do you remember what I told you?

17
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,480
You must do it well later.

18
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,000
Peace and love.

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,879
I see.

20
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,599
You adults are too nagging.

21
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm nervous too.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,760
Go for it.

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
Something bad happened, Qingyou.

24
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,559
I can't get in touch with Eve.

25
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,120
He hasn't replied to me for hours.

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,000
If he doesn't come,

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,199
who will Lyuluo interact with?

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,160
Don't worry.

29
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,600
He won't give up this opportunity.

30
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,360
But, Qingyou,

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,399
time's up.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,320
Start on time.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,839
Don't worry.

34
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:28,880
Qingyou.

35
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,479
Has it started yet?

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,160
Yes.

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,240
Hello, everyone.

38
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,080
I'm Lyuluo. Long time no see.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
What a plagiarist. She is really shameless.

40
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,759
Let me see how she will apologize.

41
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,600
I used to like her.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,839
What a surprise. She is a plagiarist.

43
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,600
Can't she admit she has no talent?

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
I hate people who gain without doing any work.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,479
I think you may have misunderstood me.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,839
I'm not here

47
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,279
to apologize to you this time,

48
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,880
but I wanna take this opportunity to show you

49
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,639
that I didn't plagiarize.

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,919
So

51
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,520
if you scold me again,

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,839
I shall do you a mischief.

53
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,839
You can't even admit you have done something wrong.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
How shameless.

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
I didn't do anything wrong.

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,440
Why should I admit it?

57
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,919
What a plagiarist. You're ugly.

58
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,960
You make me sick.

59
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,199
If you don't wanna see me,

60
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,160
you can go out.

61
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,080
Click exit in the upper left corner.

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,479
See you.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,520
Lyuluo.

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
These people are so boring.

65
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,440
I have nothing to say to them.

66
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:22,600
What time is it?

67
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,000
Eve is not online yet.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,000
Hold on.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,720
Wait a minute, okay?

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
They went too far.

71
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,279
I know you're wronged.

72
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,240
Show up at once,

73
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,720
or I will withdraw the terms agreed before.

74
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,600
Mr. Mo.

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,199
Suddenly there was a temporary meeting.

76
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,880
I just finished it.

77
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:45,839
Go online.

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,679
Here he comes.

79
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,600
He's coming. Eve is online.

80
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,600
Come on.

81
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,360
You can do it.

82
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,960
Hello, everyone. I'm Eve.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,759
Thank you very much for speaking for me.

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,759
But I show up today

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,520
because I wanna help clear the air

86
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,039
for this friend I don't know.

87
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,759
Eve.

88
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,119
They all think I copied your work.

89
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,679
Today I wanna know

90
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,880
who is better.

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,559
OK.

92
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,959
Let's have an impromptu competition.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,320
OK. You set a theme.

94
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a nice day today.

95
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Let's take the sky as the theme?

96
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,160
OK.

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,480
So hot.

98
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,799
She can do it.

99
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,640
Mr. Mo.

100
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,239
This time you convinced Eve to broadcast live.

101
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,880
Thank you.

102
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,200
The return is too low.

103
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,920
I don't allow my return on investment

104
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,519
to be a simple thank you.

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,079
So what do you want?

106
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,119
I'll tell you when I think of it.

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,880
Look at the rubbish.

108
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,920
Your look...

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,279
Live-action The Death of Marat.

110
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,720
Please find me some cold medicine quickly.

111
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
I have classes this afternoon.

112
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,519
Come on.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,839
You can't go to class like this.

114
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,160
I'll call your sister later

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,040
and ask her to pick you up.

116
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,559
No.

117
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't call my sister.

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,920
She's been busy lately.

119
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,160
If I go home because of this trivial matter,

120
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,079
my family will have a bad hair day.

121
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,799
But you can't sleep in the studio.

122
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,119
There is no bed here.

123
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,640
I thank you very much for not charging me rent.

124
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,799
Is there any cold medicine here?

125
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,679
Yes.

126
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,040
No.

127
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,160
No.

128
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,079
There is no cold medicine.

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,399
You don't wanna trouble your own sister?

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,839
But you can

131
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,880
trouble the other sister.

132
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,760
No.

133
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,920
I don't want Fang Qi to see me like this.

134
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,480
The time is right.

135
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,760
As a relationship expert,

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,519
I'll deprive you of your human rights for now.

137
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
（To Fang Qi: I'm sick and homeless)

138
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,519
Just wait.

139
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:36,959
What did she reply to me?

140
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,160
Take medicine when you are sick.

141
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,440
That's all.

142
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,000
Youyou.

143
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,920
I just went to Lemi.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
They told me you weren't there.

145
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:12,760
What happened?

146
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,200
You didn't reply to me.

147
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,720
I had to come here for you.

148
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,079
You're still angry?

149
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,519
I apologize, okay?

150
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,119
No need.

151
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,839
We broke up.

152
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,799
Can we just calm down?

153
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,400
Don't be so impulsive.

154
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,080
Since you think there is a problem between us,

155
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,840
why don't we just solve it

156
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,960
as openly as before?

157
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
Do you think I made this decision on impulse?

158
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,640
We can't be the same as before.

159
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,359
We've all changed.

160
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,559
Mr. Mo.

161
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,200
Thank you for what happened to Lyuluo.

162
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,440
Do you immediately give away

163
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,919
what others gave you?

164
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,159
Wang Ji.

165
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,400
Only delicious food is irreplaceable.

166
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:37,559
Here.

167
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,640
It's very delicious.

168
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,880
Enjoy it.

169
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,760
Wang Ji.

170
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,559
I remember you are on a diet, right?

171
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,840
You are always

172
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,919
so indecisive.

173
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,239
Don't you feel tired?

174
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,520
You are moody and your words have a double meaning.

175
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,119
Don't you feel more tired?

176
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,440
Wang Ji.

177
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,119
If you finish enjoying it,

178
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,159
sort out all the materials

179
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,440
and send them to me tomorrow.

180
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:19,559
No.

181
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,359
Send them to me later.

182
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,880
After the investment,

183
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,520
we will revise the framework adjustment proposal

184
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,200
proposed by Yixin Ecology.

185
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,159
In addition to retaining
the core technology department,

186
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,239
other departments need to 
be streamlined and optimized.

187
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,919
This means that

188
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,359
Mr. Jia and others
who used to manage these departments

189
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,320
will be fired.

190
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,799
OK.

191
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,400
That's settled.

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,280
This Mr. Jia is one of the founders of the company.

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
He has deep feelings for the company.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,640
I've been talking to him for almost a month.

195
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,679
He is still very stubborn.

196
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:02,880
He is unwilling to give up.

197
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:06,880
Got it.

198
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll solve it.

199
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,320
OK.

200
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,159
Take your time.

201
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
You know my attitude.

202
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,400
Yixin was founded by me.

203
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,280
It's like my child.

204
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,080
No parent

205
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,520
is willing to abandon their children.

206
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,119
So, you asked me to quit?

207
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,359
No way.

208
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,280
I admire your feelings and sense of responsibility.

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,359
But Yixin has been in negative equity
for five consecutive years.

210
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,559
Instead of going on like this,

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,679
it is better to find another way out for it.

212
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,960
Just like now,

213
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
do you want to save what is important
or what is not so important?

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,039
Sometimes giving up

215
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,520
is not necessarily a bad choice.

216
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,359
You capitalists

217
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,359
only know how to make profits,

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,440
but lack humanism.

219
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,760
I admit that

220
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,440
the company is getting better.

221
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't keep up with it.

222
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,599
But as long as I manage it,

223
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,159
I won't give it up.

224
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,320
You don't know how to be flexible

225
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,000
because of your feelings,

226
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,520
so you will only lose the whole game in the end.

227
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,799
Checkmate.

228
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,919
You...

229
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,239
You have been working hard for so many years.

230
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,840
Your achievements are obvious to all.

231
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,440
But no matter how good the general is, he needs rest.

232
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,760
Now that you have made up your mind,

233
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,039
why do you gild the lily?

234
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,200
Anyway,

235
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,599
you are my uncle.

236
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,799
Well.

237
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,840
I've been with your dad for over 30 years.

238
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,159
I never thought

239
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,159
it would happen today.

240
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
When he was young, he always said that

241
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,960
people are humanistic.

242
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:53,719
He would be sad

243
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,239
if he saw you like this today.

244
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,799
I did it

245
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,719
just because I didn't wanna repeat his mistakes.

246
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,479
Don't worry.

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,039
Under my management,

248
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:12,359
Yixin will only be better than it is now.

249
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,359
When he was young, he always said that

250
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,119
people are humanistic.

251
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:30,520
He would be sad

252
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,359
if he saw you like this today.

253
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,159
I did it

254
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,919
just because I didn't wanna repeat his mistakes.

255
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
Giving classes in spite of his illness.

256
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,640
It's so touching.

257
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,400
The Battered-Body Trick

258
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,080
doesn't work on Fang Qi.

259
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,320
Why?

260
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,000
(Qi, he doesn't want to see doctors anyway.
As his brother, I can't bear to see this.)

261
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,640
Class,

262
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,039
drawing a portrait

263
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:21,320
of your favorite person

264
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,960
is the homework for this class.

265
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,719
That's all for today.

266
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:26,760
Goodbye, class.

267
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,239
Goodbye, sir.

268
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,520
Mr. Xu.

269
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,320
I heard you had a cold.

270
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,080
Did you take the medicine?

271
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,400
It's just a slight cold, nothing serious.

272
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,880
You must take care of yourself.

273
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,719
Is there any hot water?

274
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,640
Let me make you a pack of cold medicine.

275
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,159
No, thanks.

276
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,599
I've got it for you.

277
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,719
God bless me!

278
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,559
Here.

279
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,080
Thank you.

280
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,760
You're welcome.

281
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,320
Qi should see this scene.

282
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,840
If she gets jealous,

283
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,239
it's done.

284
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,000
So someone took care of him.

285
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,960
It seems that I'm redundant.

286
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,440
Qi, there you are.

287
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,919
You came for Wei, right?

288
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,640
I...

289
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,599
Fang Qi.

290
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:19,760
Perfect.

291
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,840
What a prophet I am.

292
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,000
Qingyou.

293
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,320
It's Friday. You don't have to work overtime.

294
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,559
I'll leave when I'm done.

295
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,320
After you.

296
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,359
Then don't be too late.

297
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,000
Bye.

298
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,719
Let's go.

299
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,559
Hello.

300
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,119
Hello, is this Miss Xu?

301
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,239
Who are you?

302
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,799
The apartment you paid attention to before

303
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,880
is now available.

304
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,719
I specially inform you

305
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:55,479
that you can book it online.

306
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,919
That's great.

307
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,039
Please send me the link.

308
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,239
Thank you.

309
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,380
(Agent: Miss Xu, there are more apartments for rent.
Here are the pictures)

310
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,359
It looks good.

311
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,400
Yes!

312
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,520
I seem to have disturbed you.

313
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,319
Mr. Mo.

314
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,160
It's not good that you suddenly showed up here.

315
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,479
And now that you know you are disturbing me,

316
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,199
just say goodbye.

317
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,439
What's the matter?

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,959
I want a return on investment.

319
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,199
Is that your attitude?

320
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,599
I'm in a bad mood today.

321
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,239
Stay with me.

322
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,280
I didn't promise to play this.

323
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,520
It's too late for you to regret it now.

324
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,839
Are you sure you're not kidding me?

325
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,880
Aren't you afraid of

326
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,359
nothing?

327
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,160
Of course.

328
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,920
Well, we will see.

329
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,239
You don't have to help me.

330
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,439
I can walk by myself.

331
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,640
Sorry.

332
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,880
You asked me to stay with you.

333
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,599
And you apologized to me.

334
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,479
Can't you just be ruthless

335
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,079
or just be friendly?

336
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,160
Now you apologize to me.

337
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,719
Why bother?

338
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,160
You're right.

339
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:07,680
Why bother?

340
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,959
You are very strange today.

341
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,719
What's wrong with you?

342
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,119
Nothing.

343
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,479
I have worked for ten years,

344
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,479
and today,

345
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,560
I made another inhuman decision.

346
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,079
And then?

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,680
You feel guilty?

348
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,640
From a rational point of view,

349
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,479
I think I made the most correct decision.

350
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,560
But from an emotional point of view...

351
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,479
When Lemi optimized the structure,

352
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,880
I went for you.

353
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,920
At that time you told me about

354
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,880
survival of the fittest

355
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,160
and not to be compassionate

356
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,479
in the workplace.

357
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,800
You know,

358
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,599
you're really annoying

359
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,400
when you're ruthless.

360
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,359
But then I think

361
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:07,920
you're right.

362
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,719
For the overall interests,

363
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,359
one should indeed abandon one's feelings.

364
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,400
So

365
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,800
now that you have made

366
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,439
the right decision intellectually,

367
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:20,719
don't criticize yourself emotionally.

368
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,239
So

369
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,920
you approve of my decision, right?

370
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,000
Maybe.

371
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,599
If so,

372
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,719
accompany me to play an exciting one.

373
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Watching you scream can relieve my stress.

374
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,239
Leave it to me.

375
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,000
I can't believe you take care of yourself like this.

376
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,239
Playing those exciting games

377
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,680
can really relieve stress.

378
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,959
But we can also do it

379
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,079
in this calm way.

380
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,079
Besides,

381
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,959
you and I are both older.

382
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,839
Playing too many exciting games

383
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,800
is bad for our hearts.

384
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,079
Then we are not suitable for this.

385
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,920
Why?

386
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,439
You are quite popular.

387
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,359
It seems that I came at a bad time

388
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,400
and disturbed you.

389
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,800
No.

390
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,000
What? Hold it.

391
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,400
You are quite hot.

392
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,319
You should have a fever.

393
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:40,880
Take the medicine.

394
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,640
It tastes bitter.

395
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:45,839
Take it.

396
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,199
Only in this way can you get well.

397
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,719
You don't have hands?

398
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:12,719
Do it yourself.

399
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,880
Come on.

400
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,119
Take it.

401
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
What's your plan?

402
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,439
Still wanna stay in the studio?

403
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,760
I haven't thought about it.

404
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,439
Hurry up. Then come with me.

405
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,479
Hurry up.

406
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,439
Thank you.

407
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,719
What a surprise. You said thank you to me.

408
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Because you accompanied me.

409
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,839
I just returned a favor.

410
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,920
If you really wanna thank me,

411
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,520
keep your distance from me.

412
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:03,680
And

413
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,520
I hope you can be happy every day

414
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,160
so as not to trouble me at work.

415
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:09,959
I've arrived.

416
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,479
OK.

417
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,000
I hope we keep our word.

418
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,119
Of course.

419
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,839
I'll give you something.

420
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:40,319
Do not use Party A's personal belongings
without authorization.

421
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,359
Party A's private domain shall not be disturbed at will.

422
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,719
After 11 o'clock every night,

423
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,560
Party B can only stay in his room.

424
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,319
Do not make noise.

425
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,839
Party B shall not have

426
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,800
any objection to Party A.

427
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,959
The form of rent payment:

428
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,839
because Party B is poor,

429
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,839
he pays the rent with labor.

430
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,719
Party B needs to clean the room,

431
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,280
sweep the floor and mop the floor every day.

432
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,839
I can also cook

433
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,119
and wash your clothes.

434
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,719
Do you wanna write them all in it?

435
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,520
Are you crazy?

436
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,719
You volunteered to add clauses?

437
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,239
Let's go to hospital.

438
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,800
No. I'll sign it.

439
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,680
I'm not sick.

440
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,239
As long as you let me live here,
everything will be fine.

441
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,560
Is the studio so bad?

442
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,810
(Rent contract: Party B, Xu Wei.)

443
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,319
Don't accuse me of employing child labor.

444
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,400
No.

445
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,239
Sign one for me, too.

446
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,079
What if you regret it?

447
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,959
Have you ever heard of

448
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:44,040
the landlord taking the initiative
to tear up the body contract?

449
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,760
Well.

450
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,640
All right.

451
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,119
Now that you have moved out of your home

452
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,199
and are ready to be self-reliant,

453
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,079
work hard.

454
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,839
Don't worry your parents, okay?

455
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,839
What you said is exactly the same
as what my sister said.

456
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,319
What are you talking about?

457
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,280
I'll do as you say.

458
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,719
That's more like it.

459
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,040
Then can I move here

460
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,640
tonight?

461
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,400
Xu Wei.

462
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,040
It's so late.

463
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,920
Why did you come to Fang Qi's apartment?

464
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,920
Why are you here?

465
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,439
I'll come whenever I want.
It's none of your business.

466
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,640
What are you talking about?

467
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,719
Let me introduce her to you solemnly.

468
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,239
This is Princess Xu,

469
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,640
my super VIP guest.

470
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,439
He is

471
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,680
an unimportant new tenant.

472
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,800
Tenant?

473
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:39,359
Get out of the way.

474
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,079
Article 6.

475
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,479
If Party A has guests visiting, meetings,

476
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,680
parties and other activities,

477
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
Party B shall take the initiative to leave.

478
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,880
Umm...

479
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,800
It's so unfair.

480
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,439
Sister.

481
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,119
You're gonna let me go, too?

482
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:01,760
See you later.

483
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,280
Thank you for taking my brother in.

484
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,160
Come on. We are good friends.

485
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
Is your rent too low?

486
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,199
Are you his own sister?

487
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,560
My voice has gone.

488
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,079
I seriously suspect that Poker Face

489
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,079
is interested in torturing others.

490
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,599
You finally understand.

491
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,439
I told you so, okay?

492
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,479
But what happened to you today?

493
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,160
I can't believe you agreed to his excessive demands.

494
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,599
It's not too excessive.

495
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,239
I just thought

496
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,640
he was pitiful, so my heart was melted.

497
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,520
So I agreed to stay with him.

498
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,280
He was pitiful?

499
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,359
Tell me about it.

500
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,040
He

501
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,680
was in a bad mood.

502
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,880
And

503
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,439
he also discussed with me

504
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,280
about rationality and sensibility.

505
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,920
He also asked me

506
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,040
if he was really heartless.

507
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,359
I've known him for so long,

508
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,439
but for the first time,
I felt that he was a little friendly.

509
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,959
Friendly?

510
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,680
That's a little abnormal.

511
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,040
Is it because of Mr. Jia?

512
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,119
What?

513
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,719
Nothing.

514
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:17,839
About work.

515
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,040
Even if he is in a bad mood,

516
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,280
he should go to his friends.

517
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,560
Why did he come to you?

518
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,359
Because I have bad luck.

519
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,160
I don't think it's that simple.

520
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
He just wants to pretend to be weak

521
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,839
to make you sympathize with him.

522
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,079
You mean

523
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,319
he wants to play tricks on me?

524
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,959
It's pretty obvious.

525
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,040
He is usually very cool.

526
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,880
But he suddenly

527
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,719
opens his mind to you.

528
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,920
He just wants you to feel that

529
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:52,280
you are special to him.

530
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,560
If you believe that,

531
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,319
you will fall in love with him.

532
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,000
What?

533
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,959
Fall in love with him?

534
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,079
Impossible.

535
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,359
Finished?

536
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,439
Come on, sit down.

537
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:24,680
Youyou.

538
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,719
How's your new apartment?

539
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,719
Is it safe there?

540
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,959
You always work overtime.

541
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,119
Don't worry.

542
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,680
The public security condition is very good.

543
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,199
Is it convenient

544
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,599
to go to restaurants and go grocery shopping?

545
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,160
I'm an adult.

546
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,680
I'm sure I can take care of myself.

547
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,760
Don't worry.

548
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,920
We're not worried that it's not safe
for you to move there.

549
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,719
We're just

550
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,079
a little uneasy.

551
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,359
If you have a boyfriend...

552
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,400
Yunxi...

553
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:53,640
Mom.

554
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,040
We agreed not to mention him.

555
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,160
We are worried that you are too impulsive now

556
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,599
and will regret it.

557
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,319
I do regret it.

558
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,599
I regret not breaking up with him sooner.

559
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,880
My hesitation led to this ending.

560
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:15,920
Dad.

561
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm leaving.

562
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,199
Don't forget to eat health care products.

563
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:31,800
Mom.

564
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:32,959
I'm leaving.

565
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,199
Your dad just didn't understand it for a while.

566
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,239
He will be all right in a few days.

567
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,359
Youyou.

568
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,439
You take relationships very seriously.

569
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,800
If you don't tell me why you broke up,

570
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,719
I won't ask.

571
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,119
But anyway,

572
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,079
I support you.

573
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:56,599
Aren't you afraid
your dad will pick on me when you leave?

574
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,319
Pick on you?

575
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,040
Impossible.

576
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,719
I'm leaving, mom.

577
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,640
Well.

578
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,239
Do you remember what I told you?

579
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,599
Yes.

580
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,359
Visit you every week.

581
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,319
Must tell you if I am unhappy.

582
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,199
Try staying for three months first.

583
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,439
Am I right?

584
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:19,439
Bye.

585
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,000
Bye.

586
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm tired of helping you move.

587
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,359
What?

588
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,239
Obviously, I am tired.

589
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,239
Thank you.

590
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,680
Hurry up.

591
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,760
Almost there, right?

592
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,520
Turn right.

593
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:51,280
Thank you.

594
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,359
This flower...

595
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,920
Put it here first.

596
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,740
(Let go of past. Change myself.
A travel at will)

597
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,540
(Spend New Year's Eve with the one I love)

598
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,940
(Wang Ji)

599
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,560
Hello, Mr. Mo.

600
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,319
Today, Mr. Jia formally signed
the resignation agreement.

601
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,640
According to your special request,

602
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,000
we added the veto right of the core founder to him

603
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,319
and ensured that

604
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,359
he will still enjoy

605
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,119
the shareholder control over Yixin.

606
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,400
OK.

607
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,479
Mr. Mo.

608
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,160
In fact, you are really kind to Mr. Jia.

609
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,400
That's worthy of the affection of your two families
for over 30 years.

610
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,160
You haven't given me the last report.

611
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,239
Your bonus this month is confiscated.

612
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,160
I...
