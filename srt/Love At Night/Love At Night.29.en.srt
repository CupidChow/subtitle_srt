3
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,919
Sleepy head,

4
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,279
get up for breakfast.

5
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,119
Morning, Mr. Mo.

6
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,479
Morning.

7
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,119
Director Xu.

8
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,720
You bought a mold

9
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,520
in the shape of a love heart, didn't you?

10
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,360
Do I look like a person

11
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,080
who would do such a naive thing?

12
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't you?

13
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,240
You know what?

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,160
Love makes people naive.

15
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,440
So,

16
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,119
be naive.

17
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,240
Don't be shy.

18
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,720
Director Xu.

19
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,479
Do you have to make me so embarrassed?

20
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,839
I'm not trying to make you embarrassed.

21
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm complimenting you for being so cute.

22
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,160
What?

23
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,199
Got it.

24
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,919
What?

25
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:43,830
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)

26
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,360
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
Power and sex transaction.

27
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,830
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)

28

Meng.

29
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,399
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
You saw the news?

(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)

31
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,520
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
I'm watching it.

(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)

33
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,960

Yu Ming.

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,360
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,800
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
Hurry up.

36
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,279
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
Look at the official account.

37
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:54,800
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,759
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
Who posted this? Take a look.

39
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,559
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
What nonsense is this?

40
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,039
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
Oh my gosh!

41
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,000
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)
Who tries to set Qingyou up?

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,200
(Power and Sex transactions in Shangger)

43
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:11,919
You go upstairs first.

44
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,320
I'll go later.

45
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,200
We are in the eye of the storm.

46
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm worried that the criticism will be even greater.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,359
Do we have any power and sex transactions?

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,399
Why should we avoid?

49
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,519
Come on.

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
Have you heard about the senior of Shangger?

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,880
I listened to gossip all the way today, exciting.

52
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,279
Those who have the capital
really know how to live it up.

53
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,399
Keep your voice down.

54
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,359
Someone might hear you.

55
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,239
It's fine. They didn't hear.

56
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,399
Mr. Mo.

57
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,320
Explain it.

58
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,760
We are in a relationship,

59
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,279
but there is no dirty dealing.

60
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,399
My private life has nothing to do with work.

61
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,920
The thing became so public that

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,640
several LPs

63
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,679
have asked this.

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
If not handled properly,

65
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,440
Shangger's reputation in the industry

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,200
will be greatly affected.

67
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,079
Take a look at

68
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,239
these headlines by these financial reporters.

69
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,040
Investment executive hooks up 
with female mid-manager.

70
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,440
Is there fairness in the capital market?

71
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,559
And this one.

72
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,640
A complicated background of Shangger's executive.

73
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,600
The project prospects are worrying.

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,839
My phone has been ringing this whole morning.

75
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,720
Those words are really unpleasant

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,839
like fortune and sex transaction.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,559
Fine.

78
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,119
Mo.

79
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,559
I don't care what you have to do.

80
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,079
Handle it quickly.

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,440
Before this issue is resolved,

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,279
the partnership affair is suspended.

83
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,679
Actions only on our side are not enough.

84
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,279
Shall we put pressure on Lemi E-commerce

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,000
and suggest them to suspend Xu Qingyou's work?

86
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,799
It's not a bad thing to lay low.

87
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,000
If the invested company suspends its employee

88
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:22,320
because of this,

89
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:25,200
Shangger will become a joke of the industry.

90
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,200
You have a good point.

91
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,760
We shouldn't worry about Lemi

92
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,519
but because of

93
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:34,320
the impact of Mr. Mo's unclear relationship

94
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,359
on Shangger,

95
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,359
we can't just let this be.

96
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,359
Several LPs

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
are already questioning

98
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,959
Shangger's normalization and professionalism.

99
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,760
Once we don't handle this matter properly,

100
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,399
these LPs

101
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,839
lose their trust in us

102
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:49,959
and divest.

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
The consequences will be disastrous.

104
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,720
Mr. Mo.

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,119
You made a severe mistake.

106
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:02,799
Mr. Luo.

107
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,640
I'll fix this.

108
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,480
I will bear all the losses

109
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,519
caused to the company

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,279
but employees in my department

111
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,760
have nothing to do with this matter.

112
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,640
I hope the company will handle it impartially.

113
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,640
What's going on over there?

114
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,239
Seems a bit serious.

115
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,880
Mr. Luo has been losing his temper.

116
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,380
(Gossip)

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,239
I heard some official accounts have exposed
the power and sex transaction.

118
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,079
No wonder she was promoted so quickly.

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,559
She lost the competition

120
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,959
and the company immediately

121
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,279
set up a development department for her to be the boss.

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Nonsense!

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,279
It's legal to spread rumors, right?

124
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,200
If you are capable...

125
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,119
A clean hand wants no washing.

126
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
Don't waste your words with them.

127
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
I heard this Mr. Mo

128
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,279
is a troublesome person.

129
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,320
Your sacrifice is big enough.

130
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,640
If we knew that Director Xu was so capable,

131
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,839
we should learn more from her.

132
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,519
Director Long.

133
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
If hearsay and

134
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,320
ulterior motive are all your abilities,

135
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,880
then you have to learn a lot from me.

136
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,079
If Shangger's reputation is damaged,

137
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
then Lemi's is inevitable.

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Everyone's jobs are all tied together

139
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,559
and there is no need to gloat.

140
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:27,959
How's it?

141
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't worry.

142
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
They are still in meeting.

143
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
I'll keep you updated.

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,239
Qingyou,

145
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,479
come to my office.

146
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:04,200
Are you looking for me because of Mr. Mo?

147
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,559
Is the company affected?

148
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,359
Qingyou.

149
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,679
Don't worry.

150
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,159
Have a cup of tea.

151
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:18,960
Here's the thing.

152
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,320
Mr. Li from Sanhao Beauty
has just notified me that

153
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,479
the cooperation with us on Lyuluo's live broadcast

154
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,039
will not be considered for the time being.

155
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,799
But the contract is about to be signed.

156
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,119
Let me talk to him.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,799
Everyone is watching now

158
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,919
and hoping it as exciting as possible.

159
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,359
If you go now,

160
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,960
no matter what you say or do,

161
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,400
it will add fuel to the fire.

162
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,080
Don't worry.

163
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,119
I know what should I do.

164
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,039
It's not that I don't believe in your abilities.

165
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,719
It's that the condition is special.

166
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
I've thought about it.

167
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,919
You should put this project aside for now

168
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,080
and let others do it.

169
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,960
You want to suspend my job?

170
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,159
That's not what I mean.

171
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,719
I want you to go to other departments

172
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,880
to coordinate other tasks first

173
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,440
so that the lower-level employees
will have more experience.

174
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,239
Besides,

175
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,719
if you go out at this time,

176
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,159
and even if people smile on the face,

177
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,479
you don't know what they think

178
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,719
in their minds.

179
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,400
I just fell in love.

180
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,479
What's wrong?

181
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:23,840
Qingyou.

182
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,479
I trust you.

183
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,640
I also trust Mr. mo.

184
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
But now the public opinion is booming

185
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,719
and the client's hesitation makes sense.

186
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:35,919
You should

187
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,840
be patient

188
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,479
and make a temporary tactical retreat.

189
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,320
When this is over,

190
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,960
I'll be your marriage witness.

191
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,679
Fish, shrimp, chicken.

192
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,880
Why are you here?

193
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,719
I came to visit my sister.

194
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,400
What are you doing here?

195
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,400
I came to see you.

196
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,080
Get out of here.

197
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,960
I will cook here.

198
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,039
We mind our own businesses today.

199
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,400
Let's not interfere with each other.

200
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,960
The main purpose is to make Xu Qingyou happy.

201
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,919
If anyone looks for trouble...

202
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,320
I need it.

203
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,960
I'll need it later.

204
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,559
Is there a problem?

205
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,750
(Wang Ji)

206
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,359
Hello, Mr. Wang.

207
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm not busy.

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,320
Qi.

209
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,320
I just want the project information.

210
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,719
Don't do this.

211
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,719
I was really happy on New Year's Day.

212
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,080
I really loved that surprise.

213
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,159
Really?

214
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,919
Okay.

215
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,719
Let's have dinner together tomorrow.

216
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,919
OK.

217
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,919
See you tomorrow.

218
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,359
Bye.

219
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,559
Did you go out with others
on New Year's Eve?

220
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah,

221
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,520
and I was extremely happy.

222
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,239
How about you?

223
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,000
Of course.

224
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,719
I couldn't be happier.

225
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,679
That's good.

226
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,359
What?

227
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,719
What's the matter?

228
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,200
I've answered the phone

229
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,679
and been asked about this all day.

230
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,159
Mr. Mo

231
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,159
was busy visiting LPs all day.

232
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,479
I can only give logistical support as much as possible.

233
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,840
He must be upset now, right?

234
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:57,719
I can ask my dad for help.

235
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,119
My dad doesn't have any other skills

236
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,520
but he is quite good at fooling people.

237
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,320
And he is the boss of Golden Sun Capital.

238
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,239
He must have some ideas.

239
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,880
Don't you have a bad relationship with your dad?

240
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
For Mr. Mo.

241
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,000
You can really lay down your face?

242
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,000
No.

243
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,960
I really treated him as my brother.

244
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,400
Although I call him

245
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,119
Lingze,

246
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
this "Lingze"

247
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,119
is really different from

248
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,880
that one before.

249
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,479
I just think he's having a hard time.

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
And he treats you so good.

251
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,080
If I help him,

252
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,440
I can pay back this favor for you.

253
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,599
Right?

254
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,919
I also want to help him

255
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,320
but we are on our own.

256
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,559
How can we help him?

257
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,479
Scold back.

258
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Didn't they

259
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
slander Lingze on the Internet?

260
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,960
Let's scold them all back

261
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,799
and clarify all the slanders.

262
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,760
Manipulating public opinion.

263
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,799
What's the difference
between us and those villains?

264
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,119
Mr. Mo won't agree.

265
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,799
What should we do then?

266
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,479
Mr. Mo is also working on it.

267
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,239
We will figure it out.

268
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,239
Qingyou, you're back.

269
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,000
Sister.

270
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:35,840
Come on.

271
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,440
-Have dinner. -Why are you two here?

272
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,159
Thanks for your hard work.

273
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,200
Come on.

274
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,280
Have dinner.

275
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,880
Try

276
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,559
my chef-level croaker first.

277
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,919
What's so special today?

278
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,559
And the black-bone chicken soup.

279
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,599
Metapenaeus ensis, 120 RMB a catty.

280
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,640
Black pig trotters, absolutely organic.

281
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,880
Fine.

282
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,359
Don't say anything.

283
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,640
Why did you two come to my house?

284
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,239
It's been a long time since I came to see you.

285
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,239
I came to deepen our relationship.

286
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,039
My hands are itchy today

287
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:11,760
and I want to cook.

288
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,520
Others can't take it.

289
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,679
Only you can take this honor.

290
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,520
Thank you.

291
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,679
Now that you know everything, don't hide it.

292
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,559
I didn't expect you two

293
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
to have such a tacit understanding.

294
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,039
Of course.

295
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,440
I am not the only one

296
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,799
who has a tacit understanding with him.

297
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,719
Let's eat.

298
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,280
Sister's hungry.

299
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,320
Come on.

300
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:40,760
Mr. Mo.

301
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,280
Please wait a minute.

302
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,359
Mr. Zhang is in a meeting.

303
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,119
He will come right away.

304
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:54,919
Mr. Mo.

305
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,840
I wondered how could such a private matter

306
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,599
blaze all over so quickly.

307
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,479
Sure enough, there is a pusher behind.

308
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,319
The corner digger

309
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,760
has to pay a price.

310
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:10,400
Right?

311
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
It will definitely not be me

312
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,719
who pays the price.

313
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,719
What about others?

314
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,719
Mr. Mo doesn't care?

315
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,880
It doesn't matter how you slander me

316
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,359
but it's another matter

317
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,160
if you hurt someone close to me.

318
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,199
Someone close to you?

319
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,680
If it weren't for you,

320
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,760
Youyou and I wouldn't get there.

321
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,560
It seems that you really don't know Xu Qingyou.

322
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,520
Not bad.

323
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,199
Who cooked the fish?

324
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,040
Me.

325
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,479
Try mine.

326
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,479
Good.

327
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,359
Any word from Poker Face?

328
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,599
Not yet.

329
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,760
He didn't reply my message.

330
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,880
Look at him.

331
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,319
He knows you are worried

332
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,400
but still ignores you.

333
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,160
Sister.

334
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,839
Mo Lingze ignores you?

335
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,959
Why are you so good at talking?

336
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,680
He is just too busy.

337
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,199
Too busy to

338
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,359
send a message?

339
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,400
I'll kick him for you.

340
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,319
That's right.

341
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,959
No time to send a message.

342
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,560
Who's gonna believe it?

343
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,079
The chicken is good.

344
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,839
Why the guitar is there?

345
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,719
Did you muck around with other's things?

346
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,160
You even protect Poker Face's guitar.

347
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,520
Are you a model girlfriend?

348
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,520
Of course I am the best girlfriend.

349
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,560
That guitar can only be touched by me.

350
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,520
No one else has the right.

351
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,640
And I practice from time to time.

352
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,439
Let me play you two a song.

353
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:19,839
No need.

354
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,160
I recently learned a song.

355
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,359
Let me sing it to you.

356
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,319
I've really made progress

357
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,760
in tone recently.

358
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,119
To accompany you through the world's scenery.

359
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:37,719
Xu Qingyou.

360
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:38,760
Xu Qingyou.

361
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,280
I think

362
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,199
everyone has

363
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,119
their own strengths.

364
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,719
You don't have to do everything well.

365
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,160
Sister.

366
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,400
Let's give up the road of music.

367
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,239
You really don't have any talent for it.

368
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,719
What are you talking about?

369
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,199
Don't talk if you don't know what to say.

370
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,599
There is still a little talent.

371
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,359
I think

372
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,199
where there's a will, there's a way.

373
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,439
Hypocritical.

374
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,680
I am hypocritical?

375
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,479
I'm not like someone who

376
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,400
has something in hand but also thinks about more.

377
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
Who thinks about more?

378
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,079
I want to have something in hand.

379
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,079
You won't let me.

380
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,319
So are you aggrieved

381
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,880
for that?

382
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:20,000
Stop.

383
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,239
What?

384
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,640
Did I come to see you two fighting?

385
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,439
Eat.

386
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,119
Or I will continue to sing.

387
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,760
Bye, Xu Qingyou.

388
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,560
Bye, sister.

389
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,800
What are you doing? Let go.

390
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,520
Wait.

391
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,400
Well...

392
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,640
I was too impulsive

393
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,199
to confess to my parents.

394
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,520
I apologize to you.

395
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,319
There is no such thing

396
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,000
as a female student.

397
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Sorry for

398
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,560
giving you a wrong impression.

399
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,640
I apologize to you.

400
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,719
I haven't contacted you in these days.

401
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,199
I can't stand it anymore.

402
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,880
Could you unblacklist me?

403
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,560
Do you have any misunderstandings
about apologizing?

404
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,079
If you say sorry to me,

405
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,439
I have to forgive you?

406
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,040
I did not break the appointment
on New Year's Eve.

407
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,760
I came to you.

408
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,439
Where did you go?

409
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,000
Me neither.

410
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,160
Never mind.

411
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,280
You were not with me.

412
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,800
It is already a regret.

413
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,079
Unless you turn back time

414
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,079
and we experience it again.

415
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,400
Then if I figure it out,

416
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,839
can you forgive me?

417
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,119
It depends on your performance.

418
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,359
What?

419
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,560
Private indemnity?

420
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,400
Don't worry too much.

421
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,640
He already has a plan.

422
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,280
He is going to find the LP.

423
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,760
With his eloquence,

424
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,640
I don't think it's a problem

425
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,760
to deal with it.

426
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,160
We gonna trust him.

427
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,920
Although he is a bit hard to deal with,

428
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,040
his business ability is still...

429
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,800
Fang Qi.

430
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
It's not my first day in the workplace.

431
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,560
Things won't be that simple.

432
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,400
It's a bit troublesome.

433
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,520
We all try our best to face it.

434
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,719
The result is hard to say.

435
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:32,880
Right?

436
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,239
I'm really clueless.

437
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,079
I can't help with anything.

438
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,359
Don't say this.

439
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,119
For Poker Face,

440
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,040
you're the biggest motivation
for him to do all this.

441
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,359
And

442
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,319
vice versa.

443
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:52,079
I don't want him to do this alone.

444
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,880
We'll go through this together.

445
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,640
Uncle.

446
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,040
Uncle,

447
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,160
don't worry.

448
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,319
It's not a big deal.

449
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:23,880
Not a big deal?

450
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,160
Then what is a big deal?

451
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,280
I am in the law business.

452
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,800
I've seen a lot.

453
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,520
This is really complicated.

454
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,319
I don't care what you do

455
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,479
but You is my daughter.

456
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,239
She's really worrying.

457
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,239
The problem is already being solved.

458
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,119
It is not as serious as you think.

459
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,319
I shouldn't interfere with

460
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,599
you young people's affair

461
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
but there's one thing you have to remember.

462
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,439
No matter what difficulties you encounter,

463
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,800
we will always be your family.

464
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,520
We face the difficulties

465
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,800
together.

466
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,479
By the way.

467
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,439
Your aunt

468
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,760
made ginseng chicken soup specially for you.

469
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,319
She asked me to bring it to you.

470
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,239
Drink it up.

471
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,680
OK.

472
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:20,760
Uncle,

473
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,800
take a seat upstairs.

474
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,000
No.

475
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,520
Right.

476
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,359
You

477
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,079
is sentimental.

478
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,439
Accompany her more

479
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
when you have time.

480
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,000
Uncle,

481
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:39,719
don't worry.

482
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,280
I will take good care of Qingyou.

483
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm relieved

484
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
with your words.

485
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:48,920
Bye.

486
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:28,920
What are you doing?

487
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,400
Arraying?

488
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:31,880
No.

489
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,199
There are so many things in the house.

490
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,199
I can't store them.

491
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm going to

492
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,400
simplify my life.

493
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,280
You can put them at my place.

494
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,160
Keep the old,

495
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,079
you get nothing new.

496
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,040
How is it?

497
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,079
Is it going well today?

498
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,400
All under control.

499
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:52,520
Right.

500
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,719
I'll show you something.

501
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,800
(Deposit: 523,231.32 yuan)

502
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
This is all my savings for so many years.

503
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,199
Awesome, right?

504
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,119
Director Xu can manage the family well.

505
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Of course.

506
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:03,920
Besides,

507
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,479
I hardly use these bags.

508
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,599
If they are all sold,

509
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,599
there should be a lot of money.

510
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,719
Fang Qi's a big mouth.

511
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,560
Didn't we make a deal that

512
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,520
you trust me and I trust you?

513
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,239
So if there is any difficulty,

514
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,640
we must face it together.

515
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,280
Right?

516
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,599
You have so little confidence

517
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,920
in your boyfriend?

518
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,119
Of course I have confidence.

519
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,520
This is just plan B.

520
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,160
Right.

521
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,680
What about you?

522
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,079
I heard Mr. Zhai stopped your project.

523
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,119
Didn't we make a deal that

524
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,119
you trust me and I trust you?

525
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,599
There will always be a solution to everything.

526
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,239
Right?

527
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,439
Got it.

528
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:46,560
Come here.

529
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:47,760
Let me show you something.

530
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:50,839
Put your shoes on.

531
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,000
Let's go.

532
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,319
Here.

533
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,760
My dad is here?

534
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,280
How do you know?

535
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,839
This is

536
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,599
unique to my family.

537
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,439
Yeah.

538
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,040
Your dad brought the soup downstairs

539
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,319
and left.

540
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,439
I asked him to come up and sit for a while

541
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,560
but he refused.

542
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,680
What?

543
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,640
Jealous?

544
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,040
No.

545
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,040
My dad is now partial to his son-in-law.

546
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,400
You want to drink?

547
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,359
No.

548
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:29,439
Well,

549
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,199
don't drink then.

550
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,400
I want to drink.

551
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:40,719
Here.

552
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,800
Thank you.

553
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,079
My parents treat you better

554
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,319
than me.

555
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,959
Smells good.

556
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,800
Of course.

557
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,199
The taste of the family

558
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,560
is incomparable

559
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,599
to any Michelin restaurants.

560
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,040
Xu Qingyou,

561
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,560
you can't bully me anymore

562
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,479
from today.

563
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,199
Why?

564
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:17,000
Because I have family at my back now.

565
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:21,880
Family.

566
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,719
Family is

567
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,199
no matter what you have to face,

568
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,079
the family will face it together.

569
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:30,719
Right?

570
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,839
Do this plan according to what I said.

571
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,479
Sa, everything's ready. See you tomorrow.

572
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,920
Come to the bar to rehearse at ten o'clock tonight.

573
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,119
Work overtime at night.

574
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
I have no time.

575
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,959
It seems that you can't see the surprise from Qingyou.

576
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:01,640
OK.

577
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,439
Wait for me.

578
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,239
There is no place for you on stage today.

579
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:38,400
Take a rest.

580
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:40,479
You didn't play as good as her.

581
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,400
Are you touched?

582
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,199
You must cherish her.

583
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:20,680
Of course.

584
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,959
How about it?

585
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,599
Better than me.

586
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,040
I have something to tell you.

587
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,160
I have a job

588
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,560
and deposit.

589
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,000
We don't have to worry about our life.

590
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,000
When you were in pain,

591
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,359
I've not been there for you.

592
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:10,719
But in the future,

593
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,439
I hope to be with you

594
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,920
as a family member.

595
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,800
Mo Lingze.

596
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,079
I solemnly ask you.

597
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,880
Do you want to be the person with me for the rest of my life?

598
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,599
I do.

599
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,599
I do.

600
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,400
Do you?

601
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,640
I do.

602
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:45,640
Is that because you didn't prepare me a diamond?

603
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,880
It doesn't matter.

604
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,280
You gave me this bracelet.

605
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,280
This is enough.

606
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,280
Qingyou.

607
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,239
I...

608
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,760
Sorry.

609
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,639
I can't.
