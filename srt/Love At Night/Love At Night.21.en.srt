00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:43,500
(Search ex: How to deal with ex?
Is ex really unforgettable?)

4
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,600
Xu Qingyou.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,520
It's just a song.

6
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,200
Not a big deal, right?

7
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,360
How many memories do you two still have?

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,599
Thanks to you.

9
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,879
I don't feel safe leaving my son at home for a day.

10
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
You're really annoying.

11
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
(Xu Qingyou: I have things to do.
I'll leave first)

12
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,760
Leaving without saying goodbye
is not a good habit.

13
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,519
Wait for me at home
and I'll bring you goodies.

14
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,400
It's a deal.

15
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll pick him up at 10.

16
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,519
Okay, let's go.

17
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,760
Lingze.

18
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,440
I never thought

19
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,879
we would still be so tacit after 10 years.

20
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,400
There is no longer

21
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,120
any tacit understanding between you and me

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,440
and it will be the same in the future.

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,239
May I have a glass of whiskey?

24
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,720
We are closed.

25
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,559
Still mad at me?

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,879
I only know,

27
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,279
once something is broken,

28
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,800
even if it is restored,

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,080
it will not return to the way it was before.

30
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,959
You left so decisively then.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,599
Why are you back now?

32
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,919
Work.

33
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,000
Work?

34
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,479
Then what kind of work was it

35
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,880
that made you let go of your relationship with him?

36
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,839
I left him for my own future,

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,160
but now I'm back.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,080
I'm going to get him back.

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,199
Have you seen this?

40
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,440
When you left,

41
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,240
(Mo Lingze: Tang Xi. I just want to know if you're safe)
he looked for you every day like a madman.

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,839
What a proud man he was!

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,880
How irritated he was

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,240
to become so humble?

45
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,960
(Mo Lingze: I will accept any decision you make)
There are really many ways to break up.

46
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,479
You didn't have to

47
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,839
choose this way.

48
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,639
Did you consider his feelings?

49
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,679
I'll pay him back

50
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,399
what I owe him.

51
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,279
You gave him the company he needed most,

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
but you also gave him the hardest blow.

53
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,559
He has found someone better for him now.

54
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,000
He doesn't need you anymore.

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,360
I can give him anything he wants.

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,960
I could

57
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,600
and I still can.

58
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
It was a really rewarding day.

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll take this one.

60
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,119
These are for you.

61
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,039
These...

62
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,240
Then I'll give this to my sister.

63
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
She'll like it.

64
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,440
What's wrong with you?

65
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,759
Speaking of your sister,

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,839
I haven't even figured out

67
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,720
how to tell her about us yet.

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,000
What do you think her reaction will be?

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,279
I know my sister best.

70
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,720
Look,

71
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,759
I am her beloved brother

72
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,960
and you are her best confidant.

73
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,000
Maybe she can't be happier.

74
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,399
I probably wouldn't be happy

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,320
if your sister was with my brother.

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
Then I don't care if she's happy or not.

77
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,279
But if she wants to punish us,

78
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
let her come at me and I'll protect you.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
No way.

80
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,920
If she wants to punish us,

81
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,679
I must take half of the blame with you.

82
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,480
No, I said

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,399
I'll take the blame for you.

84
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,160
You want to run away after you kiss me?

85
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,480
Xu Qingyou, open the door.

86
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,600
I heard the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

87
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,160
Nonsense.

88
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,440
The vacuum cleaner is not turned on at all.

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
How come there is a sound?

90
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,399
I bought your favorite.

91
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
What's that?

92
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,760
Don't think you can buy me off

93
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
with these sugar-coated bullets.

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,239
I have to go to bed early, good night.

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,040
Why are you in such a hurry?

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,279
I have a meeting tomorrow

97
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,119
and I need to prepare materials.

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,160
Are you jealous?

99
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,239
I'm not.

100
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,839
Let me down.

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,279
Do you know
that you are breaking into a private house?

102
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,679
You let me in.

103
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,160
Who knew that would set a fox to keep the geese?

104
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,359
Director Xu.

105
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,839
I demand to fulfill my privilege as your family.

106
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
What privilege?

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,799
Be your mind trash can.

108
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:47,079
I know it's bad for me to think this way, but

109
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm full of images

110
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,079
of you and Tang Xi now.

111
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,440
The longer I stay with you,

112
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,079
the more I realize that I don't know you at all.

113
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,920
I don't know anything

114
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,440
about your life and your colleagues.

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
I didn't participate in your life before

116
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,559
and I'm not sure

117
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,959
if I will be in your future life.

118
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,160
It's over.

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,799
Now you are my girlfriend.

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,720
But I may break up with you.

121
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,920
You're jealous.

122
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,399
The family's privilege is not fulfilled.

123
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,239
I'll punish you to watch something with me.

124
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,079
The song I wrote a few days ago.

125
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,200
I originally wanted to give it to someone

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,679
but now it seems that

127
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,200
it can't be given out.

128
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,959
Now that it can't be given out, just forget it.

129
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,559
Okay, then don't give it out.

130
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
Anyway, someone listened to it

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,679
and thinks it's normal.

132
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,480
Director Xu.

133
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,239
I want to apply for something.

134
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,480
Please.

135
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,760
It'll be the band's anniversary a few days later.

136
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,320
I have to take a family member with me.

137
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I'll think about it

138
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,720
and see if I have time.

139
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,839
Think about it?

140
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,720
Then how can you

141
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,880
make sure?

142
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,399
It depends on your performance.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,600
Received.

144
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,279
Director Xu.

145
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,359
Have you decided yet?

146
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,440
How can I decide like this? I can't.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,040
What about this?

148
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,839
It's fine.

149
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,480
Then it's settled.

150
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:59,279
Okay.

151
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:01,920
Thank you.

152
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,719
Hey, Xu Wei.

153
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,479
I'm running late.

154
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,520
Can we talk after work?

155
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,960
Look back.

156
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,880
If you have something to say, say it here

157
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,799
or we'll both be screwed if your sister sees us.

158
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,400
Yeah.

159
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,320
You haven't figured out how to tell her?

160
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,719
Okay.

161
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,799
What's the matter?
Why do you come all of a sudden?

162
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,200
I know that you go to work on time every day

163
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,479
and you don't have a good breakfast.

164
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,440
This is the love breakfast I made for you.

165
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,000
It's just a breakfast.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,679
I can order the takeout.

167
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,640
Can the takeaway be comparable to mine?

168
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,080
OK, I'm going to work.

169
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,799
Have breakfast first

170
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,479
and then drink coffee.

171
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,520
Got it.

172
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,000
And...

173
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,239
Do you have time after work?

174
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,000
Go to the studio.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,080
I will cook you chicken soup.

176
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,799
I have to work overtime at night.

177
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,440
But...

178
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,239
Fine.

179
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,039
I'll try my best, OK?

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,520
OK, go to work.

181
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,119
Bye-bye.

182
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,080
Miss Xu.

183
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,880
Do you have time to talk to me?

184
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,440
Do we have anything to talk about?

185
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,960
I have something you must want to see.

186
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,359
No problem.

187
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,840
Some routines in college.

188
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,280
You want me to see this?

189
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,359
But after all

190
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,159
I participated in his whole youth

191
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,840
but you know nothing about this.

192
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,159
Are you not curious?

193
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,080
Miss Tang, I'm really not curious at all.

194
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,679
On the contrary,

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,599
you seem to be very concerned about our present.

196
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,359
I won't let this trivial matter

197
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,719
affect our relationship.

198
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,719
Don't live in your memories.

199
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,119
Yours is

200
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,479
called past.

201
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,960
Miss Xu.

202
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,159
Mo Lingze was indifferent and closed
when he was in college.

203
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,799
He was totally a different person back then.

204
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,919
After he was with me,

205
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,440
he gradually began to change

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,719
and slowly grew into Mr. Mo

207
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,559
who is well-known in the industry.

208
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,359
So all you know

209
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,000
is his present.

210
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,400
Fang Qi, your phone keeps ringing.

211
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,159
It doesn't matter. I'll check it later.

212
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:02,159
Finally finished.

213
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,960
How is it?

214
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,599
Doesn't it taste good?

215
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,520
Why is it so delicious?

216
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,640
Why are you so virtuous?

217
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,200
I have to go. I've stayed for too long.

218
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,960
You haven't eaten the soup.

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,320
It...

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,880
It's raining outside.

221
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,119
I don't have an umbrella.

222
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,640
Why don't you stay here?

223
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,880
You have.

224
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,799
What is it if you don't have an umbrella?

225
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,239
What is it?

226
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Xu Wei.

227
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,440
You...

228
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,919
Screwed.

229
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,440
Am I hallucinating out of anger?

230
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,359
Well...

231
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,640
Xu Qingyou, listen to me.

232
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,000
Sister, Fang Qi and I are serious.

233
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,280
It's over. The Xu family is over.

234
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,000
Are you out of your mind?

235
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,520
Xu Qingyou.

236
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,640
Sister.

237
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,640
Xu Qingyou, listen to me.

238
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,760
Sister, wait.

239
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
Sister.

240
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,520
We didn't intend to hide it from you.

241
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,840
Really.

242
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,520
Yeah.

243
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,000
I can't wait to tell the world.

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,520
Wait a minute.

245
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,760
Don't say anything.

246
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,200
I need to chill.

247
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
If any of you follow me,

248
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I'll break up with you.

249
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,760
No.

250
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,119
If she has anything to do with you,

251
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,000
let her go for me.

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,599
Who's that?

253
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,880
What's wrong?

254
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,239
What happened?

255
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,520
Fang Qi and Xu Wei are dating.

256
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,159
I really can't understand.

257
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,960
Xu Wei used to follow me and Fang Qi

258
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,479
with bare buttocks.

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,479
At that time, he was still wearing open crotch pants.

260
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,039
As soon as Xu Wei provoked Fang Qi,
Fang Qi beat him.

261
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,640
But now what?

262
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,960
She stopped beating him, but she kissed him.

263
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,640
But what I care most about is that

264
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
no one tells me that they are in love.

265
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
They both hide it from me.

266
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,520
Maybe

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,200
they want to wait for the relationship to stabilize

268
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,119
before telling you.

269
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:18,960
Didn't we tell them

270
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,479
about us at the beginning?

271
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,039
Can it be the same for us?

272
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,080
And whose side are you on?

273
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,840
One is my brother and the other is my best friend.

274
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,039
We're done.

275
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,330
(Fang Qi)

276
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,359
So many missed calls,
are you sure not to answer?

277
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,840
No, I'm not ready.

278
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,880
If this is the case,

279
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,159
I will arrange more work for Fang Qi

280
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,919
tomorrow morning

281
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,919
to vent your anger.

282
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,359
Not a chance.

283
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,880
Fang Qi is my friend, and only I can bully her.

284
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,200
No one can bully her.

285
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,479
Depends on your performance.

286
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,719
Who's that?

287
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,199
I know that you

288
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,640
are busy with work every day,

289
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,119
so you didn't reply to my messages.

290
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,439
I brought your favorite fried chicken

291
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,479
and eight of your favorite sauces.

292
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,560
Sweet and sour sauce.

293
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
Youyou.

294
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,520
We were really about to tell you

295
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,199
but you found out a step earlier.

296
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,400
Look at me,

297
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,680
just give me an out.

298
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,439
I just rob the cradle.

299
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,280
And we are sincere.

300
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
We're not joking.

301
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,920
Why can't you make it through?

302
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,719
What?

303
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,199
If you apologize, I have to forgive you, right?

304
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Do you have any misunderstandings about apology?

305
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,319
And what I'm most angry about

306
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,640
is that you keep hiding it from me.

307
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,520
Speaking of hiding from you,

308
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,680
I suddenly remembered,

309
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,239
in the summer of the third year of high school,

310
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,199
the monitor of class two had a crush on you.

311
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,520
And you also hid it from me.

312
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,520
I didn't say anything then.

313
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,319
You want to talk about this?

314
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,239
You went on a date with Feng Yu.

315
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,000
Did you tell me?

316
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,599
Didn't you know that I hate him the most?

317
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,000
You forgot about my birthday in the sophomore year.

318
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,479
You don't have me in your heart.

319
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Do you have me in your heart?

320
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,160
If you do,

321
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
will you keep hiding it from me?

322
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,119
You picked up my brother.

323
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,319
Miss Fang, are you speechless?

324
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,040
Just go.

325
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,400
I...

326
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,199
Go.

327
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,560
My shoes, Xu Qingyou.

328
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you.

329
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,680
Lingze.

330
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,640
I ordered your favorite steak and shrimp.

331
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,359
Let's get to the point you mentioned.

332
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,920
About Taikang.

333
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,479
Can't we talk about that later?

334
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,319
Look,

335
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,959
I just got a dog from my friend.

336
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:22,959
Isn't it cute?

337
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's raise it together.

338
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,959
It seems that your asthma has been cured.

339
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Not really.

340
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,719
But now, it can mainly be raised by you

341
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,760
and I can come to see it from time to time.

342
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,920
Being good at relations is indeed Miss Tang's style

343
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,640
but it's useless to me.

344
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,160
But raising a dog, watering the flowers,

345
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,400
writing songs

346
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,400
and cooking together was our dream.

347
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,280
I don't like staying in the past.

348
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
It's not the past.

349
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,719
It's just an unrealized future.

350
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,959
We have missed some time,

351
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,160
but now it's not late to remedy it.

352
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,119
If Miss Tang doesn't plan to get to the point,

353
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,680
I'm not going to accompany you.

354
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,079
It's been three days on Taikang's side.

355
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,119
Are you sure you want to hold on to this?

356
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,199
I know,

357
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,400
as long as I am still useful to you,

358
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,800
you have no way to refuse me.

359
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,719
Miss Tang doesn't know that

360
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,560
I never make up for past mistakes

361
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,880
when I make investments.

362
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,800
I only pursue newer returns.

363
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,000
And I don't like small dogs.

364
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,959
I have tried my best

365
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,680
to apologize to her sincerely today.

366
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:08,439
She is still angry.

367
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,719
If you're in a bad mood, you should eat more sweets.

368
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,400
Try this. I've baked it on my own.

369
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,599
I have no appetite.

370
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,640
Fang Qi, don't worry about it.

371
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,319
My sister just doesn't figure it out

372
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,319
for now.

373
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,119
Really?

374
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:30,839
Yeah.

375
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
I don't know

376
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,880
if she will abandon her brother.

377
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,239
But it is absolutely impossible

378
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,199
for her to break up with her close friend

379
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,119
of twenty years.

380
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,760
It makes sense.

381
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,680
For the sake of your beauty

382
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,920
I forgive you for rejecting it just now.

383
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,079
The cream is pretty delicious.

384
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,560
Right?

385
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,959
(To Mo Lingze)
I'm here, where are you?

386
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,319
Why are you here?

387
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,760
This is what I want to ask.

388
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:46,599
Thank you.

389
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,119
Fried bamboo worm, please.

390
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,400
Fried intestines.

391
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,079
Stir-fried silkworm chrysalis.

392
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,319
Boiled pork giblets with baked wheaten paste.

393
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,599
Roasted grasshoppers.

394
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,199
Kidney egg soup. Thank you.

395
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,800
You know I don't eat viscera.

396
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,319
You know that I hate bugs.

397
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,800
Did you do it on purpose?

398
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,400
We don't have some of the dishes.

399
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,959
Would you like to change to something else?

400
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,280
Just serve what you have, thank you.

401
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,680
No wonder Poker Face

402
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,520
invited me to dinner so kindly.

403
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,640
It's good to have a meal.

404
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,160
Who is Fang Qi?

405
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,040
I am. What's the matter?

406
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,160
Where is Wei Yong?

407
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,359
Where did you hide him?

408
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,839
Mr. Wei in Hengli?

409
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,280
Is he eating here today?

410
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,439
I followed his car.

411
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:44,040
Stop pretending.

412
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,560
Coquette, I'll kill you.

413
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,640
How dare you seduce my husband?

414
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,400
Let go!

415
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,920
Honey.

416
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,280
-Honey. -Wei Yong.

417
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Explain to me.

418
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:58,839
You...

419
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,040
Don't talk nonsense.

420
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,680
Never mind.

421
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,160
Xu Qingyou.

422
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,680
Let go of me.

423
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,800
Are you OK?

424
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,319
Explain to me, Wei Yong.

425
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,359
Sorry, Miss Fang.

426
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:11,800
I won't leave if you don't explain.

427
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,400
Sorry.

428
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,800
Stop, please.

429
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,920
Are you out of your mind?

430
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,280
I'm sorry.

431
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,839
Coquette.

432
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,599
You have never been able to fight since you were young.

433
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,920
Every time I fought them back.

434
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,920
Why did you bluff today?

435
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,640
Someone takes the lead.

436
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,920
Isn't it you who have been beaten up a lot
since childhood?

437
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,839
Every time I have to help you heal your bruises.

438
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,760
If you don't apply ice to the bruise,

439
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
it will quickly swell up.

440
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,119
Who is Miss Fang?

441
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,160
I am.

442
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,920
This is the medicine you ordered.

443
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,079
I didn't order it.

444
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,079
Kill you three thousand.

445
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
I know you won't leave me alone.

446
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,880
I was wrong.

447
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,599
Don't be angry, OK?

448
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,359
Actually, I'm not very angry.

449
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,400
It's just a little hard to accept it.

450
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,160
Besides,

451
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,000
you know why I'm angry.

452
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,079
I know I shouldn't hide it from you.

453
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,760
I really didn't want to hide.

454
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,119
I was thinking about how to tell you.

455
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,040
You found out

456
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,560
before I figured it out.

457
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:34,839
Does it hurt?

458
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,319
No.

459
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,319
You see, I was scratched.

460
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,359
Fang Qi.

461
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,359
What happened?

462
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,359
Sister, what happened?

463
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,640
What's the matter?

464
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,680
Did you two fight?

465
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:27,760
Sit.

466
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,599
Let me tell you a joke.

467
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:47,680
Do you know why vampires don't go to Sichuan?

468
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,160
Because they only eat blood(Similar sound as not spicy).

469
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,479
Don't be angry.

470
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,400
Don't be unhappy, okay?

471
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,680
Director Xu is so worrying.

472
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,439
I can hardly be happy.

473
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,760
I'm not.

474
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,520
You are not? I watched the monitoring.

475
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,839
Director Xu, you are really a warrior.

476
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,160
Went up and fought with her at once

477
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,760
and not afraid of her excessive behavior.

478
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,359
Right?

479
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,880
Actually, my strength was okay

480
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,439
and I couldn't

481
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,839
watch Fang Qi being bullied, right?

482
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,880
In this case,

483
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,760
you should just pull Fang Qi to the side

484
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,520
and call the police.

485
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:30,520
I think so.

486
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,959
I will do so next time.

487
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,160
I promise. I swear.

488
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,319
Don't be angry.

489
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:49,920
Don't miss the band's hot pot dinner tomorrow.

490
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,520
Of course.

491
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,119
You're so good-looking.

492
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,880
Don't be angry.

493
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,640
Does it hurt?

494
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:05,119
No, I'm pretty good.

495
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,199
Today is a blessing in disguise.

496
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,439
The good thing is that my sister finally accepted it.

497
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,640
But the bad thing is that

498
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,280
you were aggrieved.

499
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,599
Blame me, I didn't protect you well.

500
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,880
It doesn't matter. If there weren't so many onlookers,

501
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,800
I could fight another 800 rounds.

502
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Fang Qi, you are with me

503
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,119
not for you to protect yourself.

504
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,920
If you encounter this kind of thing next time,

505
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,079
tell me as soon as possible

506
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,160
and hide.

507
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,280
I'll help you fight.

508
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,439
OK.

509
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,680
So good-looking.

510
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Do you have anything you really want to do?

511
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,680
Nothing specifically.

512
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Then

513
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,119
let's do what I especially want to do.

514
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,640
What do you want to do?

515
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,119
Watch a movie

516
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:32,800
with you.

517
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,280
That's it?

518
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,119
No problem.

519
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,160
Let's go back early today

520
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,239
and watch the movie together tomorrow.

521
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,400
It's on me.

522
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,599
I'm used to it.

523
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,520
I mean

524
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,359
I'll buy you ticket

525
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,160
and you buy me popcorn, okay?

526
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,520
OK.

527
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,199
What are you doing? Arresting the prisoner?

528
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,239
Easy.

529
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,239
Let's go.

530
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,479
Come on, cheers.

531
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,319
Today is really a good day.

532
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,839
We finally have the opportunity to be with white...

533
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,520
No, we can't call you white-collar.

534
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,239
We have dinner with our sister-in-law.

535
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,800
To be honest,

536
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,000
since the last time you came to our bar

537
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,880
and broke Momo's game record,

538
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,280
I said this girl is unusual.

539
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,199
Right?

540
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,359
Only this kind of unusual girl

541
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,680
can make Momo enlightened.

542
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,280
He's finally willing to find a girlfriend.

543
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:44,439
So right.

544
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,839
Since you know she's your sister-in-law,

545
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,599
be careful not to talk too much in the future.

546
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,119
Come on, let's eat.

547
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,000
Come on.

548
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:55,760
Come on.

549
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,280
Thank you.

550
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,239
Such a nice dinner.

551
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,079
Boss...

552
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,040
Same sauces?

553
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:05,719
OK.

554
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,319
How mincing you are!

555
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,560
Mincing.

556
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,319
Although Lao Luo looks like this now,

557
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,920
he is the one who has done
the greatest business among us.

558
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,959
What do I look like?

559
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,079
Look in the mirror.

560
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,280
It's him.

561
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,359
When he started this hot pot restaurant,

562
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,160
he just wanted to open a canteen for the band

563
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,920
but he didn't expect that it's getting bigger and bigger.

564
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,199
You see, I opened a canteen

565
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,040
but was teased by them every day.

566
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,400
I got a phone call.

567
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,800
Here, try this.

568
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:40,560
What's wrong?

569
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:42,479
Things have changed in Taikang.

570
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:43,959
I'll be waiting for you at Shangger.

571
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,439
Be here in 30 minutes

572
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,359
or the project will fall through.
