00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:39,519
What's up?

4
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:41,440
Things about Taikang have changed.

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,919
I'm waiting for you at Shangger.

6
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,400
Be there in thirty minutes,

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,319
or this project will be lost.

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,239
OK, I'll come over now.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,440
As soon as the waiter came up,

10
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,760
he changed his attitude.

11
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,199
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,080
There is something urgent in the company.

13
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,120
I have to go back.

14
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,319
Please take care of her.

15
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,120
I'll be back later.

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,959
There is something urgent.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,279
I'll pick you up when I'm done.

18
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,600
Come on, eat more.

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,279
Qingyou, eat some noodles.

20
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,080
Come on, let's eat.

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,199
Let's keep eating.

22
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Watch the news.

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,000
(Shangger invested in Taikang
and reached cooperation)

24
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,880
They leaked the news deliberately,

25
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,039
trying to use public opinion
to force me to sign the contract.

26
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,000
Be careful of asking for trouble.

27
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,479
It seems that besides you,

28
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,639
Taikang also has insiders in Shangger.

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,479
Let's see who is more patient.

30
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,080
In this case, the psychological tactics you prepared

31
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,360
are completely useless.

32
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,440
The reason for releasing such public opinion news

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,839
is to tell everyone,

34
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,600
if there is no conclusive evidence,

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,720
there is no way to turn around.

36
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,279
How about cooperating with me?

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,440
It's not that I want to cooperate with you,

38
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,320
but you want to cooperate with me.

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Ruiying Technology, an affiliate of Taikang,

40
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,479
is your company with the largest investment share.

41
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,039
If something goes wrong with Taikang,

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,240
Ruiying Technology will definitely not be able to escape.

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,800
At that time,

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,279
I will resign at most,

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,960
but you will go bankrupt.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,240
How many surprises does Mr. Mo have for me?

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,600
Sure I do.

48
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,639
Excuse me.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,919
In theory,

50
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,119
the serial number of the last receipt before closing

51
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,320
minus the serial number of the first receipt
when opening

52
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,880
is the sales volume of the day.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,360
Look here.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,399
Here are internal actual sales data and receipts

55
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,399
on the 21st,

56
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,160
the serial numbers of two consecutive receipts

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,759
are disconnected.

58
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,520
The serial number of the previous receipt was 26,

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,720
but the next one jumps directly to 28.

60
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,839
In other words,

61
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,039
the statistical sales data is higher than

62
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,360
the actual sales data.

63
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,800
However, if they want to cheat by skipping bills,

64
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,240
there must be a cooperation

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,360
with the third-party stakeholders.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,880
For example...

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,559
The Auditing Department.

68
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,760
That's why I was sure

69
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,959
they would show the cloven foot.

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,600
Because once they hear the news,

71
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,279
the audit will be anxious to cover up.

72
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,799
So now we have enough evidence

73
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,480
to suspend

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,920
Shangger's investment in Taikang.

75
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,559
Next, it can be regarded as a reason.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,640
We can ask a third party to intervene

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,839
in the legal process

78
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,040
and investigate the audit problems.

79
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,640
I'll inform the third party to be ready to intervene.

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,839
I'll help you with it.

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,079
Are you full?

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,959
Mo hasn't come back yet.

83
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,200
Qingyou, let's take you home first.

84
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,200
Don't bother, I'll bring Lingze something to eat.

85
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,040
You two go first.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,359
That's okay, bye, Sa.

87
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:01,880
Bye bye.

88
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,200
Bye.

89
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Bye bye.

90
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,399
Are you all right?

91
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm OK.

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,760
Lingze has a sense of propriety. Let's go.

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,559
You know what,

94
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,519
I've known Lingze for a long time

95
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,440
but I haven't seen him fall in love with any woman,

96
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,559
except for you.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,640
He's the kind of person

98
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,359
who won't change easily once he's determined.

99
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,760
I see.

100
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,440
It's done. I'll print it.

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,119
You can go now.

102
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,200
Hard work.

103
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,559
Lingze.

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,079
What's wrong with you?

105
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:20,600
Asthma?

106
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,040
Where's the medicine?

107
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,320
I don't have any medicine.

108
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,559
I'll get some.

109
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,640
Lingze.

110
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,079
It's too slow to untie the buttons one by one.

111
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,119
This is more direct.

112
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,320
I thought

113
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,119
you would have some clever means.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,640
Unexpectedly, that's all.

115
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,839
Showing weakness to redeem the relationship.

116
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,839
If you want to make me angry,

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,079
you made it, congratulations.

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,399
But it's still far from redeeming his heart

119
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,720
by these means.

120
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,559
The stage is for you. Go on acting alone.

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,279
Are you staying here for the night?

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,519
Fire away. I'll speak without reserve.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
When were you together?

124
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,160
If I remember the anniversary with my ex

125
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,480
so clearly,

126
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,600
someone will be unhappy.

127
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,679
Definitely not me.

128
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
When did you break up?

129
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,119
Eight years ago.

130
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,040
Who mentioned it?

131
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,079
She left without saying goodbye.

132
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,079
She appears again now.

133
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,880
Is there mood swing in your heart?

134
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,119
Yeah, there was.

135
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,559
Well,

136
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,239
you're so unsure of yourself.

137
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,919
Don't change the topic.

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,200
I just appreciate her working ability.

139
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Aren't you curious about the details?

140
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,599
What details do I have to be curious about?

141
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,840
That would make me unhappy.

142
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,679
What I care about is that

143
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,640
you won't be connected with her now and in the future.

144
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:06,960
Of course.

145
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,760
If we break up in the future,

146
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,919
no matter who you contact,

147
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,719
it will have nothing to do with me.

148
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
Xu Qingyou, you thought about breaking up?

149
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,000
What if you have an affair?

150
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:28,320
Don't worry. You're attractive enough.

151
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,080
I won't be interested in others.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,679
What if

153
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,640
I fall in love with others in the future?

154
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,520
Xu Qingyou, are you crazy today?

155
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,719
Anyway,

156
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,239
I won't leave you without saying goodbye in the future.

157
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,039
Of course, I won't have an affair.

158
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,559
Good night, Mr. Mo.

159
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,760
Go to bed early.

160
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,479
Xu Wei, this is your first formal date

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,080
in 22 years.

162
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,880
Don't be cowardly.

163
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,479
Xu Wei.

164
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,039
Fang Qi.

165
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,039
Come on, carry it please.

166
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,679
Let's go.

167
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,400
Why not have some popcorn first?

168
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,440
No, I haven't finished
reading the financial statements yet.

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,039
Hurry up.

170
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,679
Thanks.

171
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,159
Fang Qi,

172
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,880
this is our first date since we were together.

173
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,520
It's precious.

174
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
I know you are busy with your work.

175
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,400
But you promised me yesterday, didn't you?

176
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,119
Just give me two hours.

177
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,960
Can we concentrate on dating?

178
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,679
Date costs money, but work can make money.

179
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,400
Which is more important?

180
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,840
Work.

181
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,200
How about

182
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,479
going skiing and enjoying a hot spring this weekend?

183
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,599
I really can't.

184
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,919
Many projects have not been finished yet.

185
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,880
It's not the time to relax.

186
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,359
Help me put it in.

187
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,520
Xu Wei, others are intermittently crazy.

188
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,039
You are intermittently timid.

189
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,119
How do you feel, my boyfriend? Are you happy?

190
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,320
Youth is good.

191
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,359
Am I really that good?

192
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,159
You're silly and easy to cheat.

193
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:44,880
Let's go.

194
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,919
Look!

195
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:07,400
Fang Qi, this movie is too scary.

196
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,039
Since you're afraid,

197
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,679
why do you watch horror movies?

198
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,719
I knew this is our first date.

199
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,799
Gu Dayan said

200
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:20,400
horror movies

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,960
help promote the relationship between couples.

202
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:29,840
Did you see that?

203
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,479
Watching horror movies

204
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,400
to promote the relationship between couples

205
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,640
is only applicable to girls under 25 years old.

206
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,159
Then what scares you?

207
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,679
I think no money is the scariest.

208
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,039
Except for this.

209
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,119
It's especially scary that slides are not saved.

210
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Give it to me.

211
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:58,880
Give me.

212
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,440
You...

213
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,239
Since we're watching horror movies,

214
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,320
I need to give you a little scary atmosphere.

215
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,320
Xu Qingyou and I are really poor sisters.

216
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,440
We fall in love with

217
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,000
a Poker Face and a naive fool respectively.

218
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
My sister is in love, right?

219
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,239
With whom?

220
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,719
The...the popcorn is delicious.

221
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,320
Who?

222
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,280
Eat it.

223
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,760
This is horrible.

224
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,640
I feel so horrible, too.

225
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,919
Hello, a glass of whiskey.

226
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
As usual, no ice.

227
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,840
Sa.

228
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,119
It's too little, isn't it?

229
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,559
Add more.

230
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,880
You made that call just now, right?

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,159
I thought things are gonna change as long as he came.

232
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,239
And then?

233
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:48,960
He's gone

234
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,440
with her.

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Give up.

236
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,719
Never mind.

237
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,679
They are like

238
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
eggs and stones.

239
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,400
They are clearly not the same kind of people,

240
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,599
but they have to get together.

241
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,039
They will fall apart

242
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,960
without my external force.

243
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,039
What about after falling apart?

244
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,919
Can you accept

245
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,599
Mo Lingze

246
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,080
when he loved other women?

247
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,200
But I loved someone else, too.

248
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,960
I've hurt him before.

249
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,719
So now I'll treat this

250
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,200
as a little revenge on me.

251
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,159
It's fair. I can accept it.

252
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,640
You are still so self-righteous.

253
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,080
Am I?

254
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Don't you have a drink with me?

255
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,400
I will keep my promise

256
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,919
about Taikang.

257
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,239
You have three days to prepare to quit.

258
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,479
Shangger

259
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,679
will delay the contract over legal issues

260
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,280
to avoid leaks.

261
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,359
I don't want these.

262
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,840
When Mr. Luo came to me,

263
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,599
he asked me to make a request.

264
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,200
I didn't ask for a penny.

265
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,840
I just asked for this access card.

266
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,520
Do you know why?

267
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,520
Because no matter who I want to approach,

268
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,479
the initiative must be in my own hands.

269
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,479
What's up?

270
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,599
Qi,

271
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,559
that woman came again.

272
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,640
Why has she been pestering Mr. Mo?

273
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:03,719
You,

274
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,920
go in and ask the boss

275
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,079
how to solve the problem of Taikang.

276
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,160
They are obviously in conference now.

277
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,719
It's not appropriate for me to go in now.

278
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,640
You just go in and ask.

279
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,599
Is it completely solved?

280
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,599
Does he need our help?

281
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,479
Isn't that more important than

282
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,040
the two of them staying in a room?

283
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,040
(Lin Siyu)

284
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:30,839
Qi,

285
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,839
I still have something else to do.
I'll leave first.

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,439
Do you have a minute?

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,959
Go shopping with me at noon.

288
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,920
Hey, what's the matter?

289
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,000
Are you available tomorrow?

290
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,079
Tomorrow,

291
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,239
I should go to work normally.

292
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,199
You take a leave

293
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,239
and go somewhere with me.

294
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,760
I have something important to tell you.

295
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,079
OK.

296
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,079
Ms. Tang,

297
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,040
where you want to go is your freedom.

298
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,199
But I kindly remind you

299
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,520
choosing the wrong target

300
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:21,079
is likely to lead to a dead end

301
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,119
and wasting effort.

302
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,839
You think you know me well, don't you?

303
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,439
I admit that

304
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,280
I agree with consequentialism.

305
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,880
If I find that the front is a dead end,

306
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,599
I won't waste a bit of effort.

307
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,239
And before the age of thirty,

308
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,439
I think there were only two ways to choose,

309
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,640
either right or wrong.

310
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,319
And I must be the one

311
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,560
who always chooses the right way.

312
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,719
But I have experienced a lot

313
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,880
over the years.

314
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,760
I gradually understood a truth.

315
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,359
In fact, right and wrong are not important,

316
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,400
what you want in your heart

317
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,880
is the most important.

318
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:18,079
Ms. Tang,

319
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,359
don't put things

320
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,199
in wrong place,

321
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:26,800
especially things that don't belong to you.

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,680
Do you have to treat me like an enemy?

323
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,800
As long as we are in a pure working relationship,

324
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,079
we won't be enemies.

325
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,880
If you insist on crossing the boundary,

326
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,640
then I have to obey my rules.

327
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,119
I gave you the confidential data,

328
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,359
because you are Mo Lingze.

329
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,959
But if

330
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,800
the person standing in front of me is a stranger,

331
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,119
everything will be different.

332
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,319
I thought

333
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,239
I had the biggest crisis

334
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,400
of my career.

335
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,160
I didn't expect Poker Face to solve it for me.

336
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,119
He hasn't blamed Wang Ji and me.

337
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,959
Are you still upset?

338
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,839
No, I'm happy.

339
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,880
That's why I asked you to come out for a big meal

340
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,760
to celebrate it.

341
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,719
But,

342
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,199
but...

343
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,400
this green dress is so beautiful.
(*Green sometimes means being cheated）

344
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,040
It suits you a little.

345
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,319
Isn't this color too tender?

346
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,160
Not for me.

347
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,800
This pair of shoes.

348
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,640
These two match well.

349
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,119
Great!

350
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:40,719
Fang Qi,

351
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,959
take it.

352
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:45,959
I wonder

353
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,400
why is this hat not green?

354
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,239
I didn't notice it.

355
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:51,880
I...

356
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,400
just want to give you something.

357
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,439
Pay more hearts to it, please.

358
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,839
Thank you.

359
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,560
What do you mean?

360
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,760
Tang Xi came to Shangger, right?

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,119
You know her?

362
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,959
Of course I know.

363
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,400
I've dealt with her before.

364
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,359
Are you bullied?

365
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:23,959
I won completely.

366
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,199
Is it true or not?

367
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,439
Of course it's true.

368
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,319
She is the queen of our investment industry.

369
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,319
She is cold-blooded.

370
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,359
How can you win her?

371
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,479
So you want to come out

372
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,839
to buy clothes during your lunch break.

373
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,359
Then prevail over your rival in love.

374
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,119
I bought this for Tang Xi.

375
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,680
I tore her shirt.

376
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,560
What?

377
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,520
You're so tough now.

378
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,079
Did you learn it from Poker Face?

379
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:56,680
Forget it.

380
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,439
I have to remind you that

381
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,640
boys will never forget

382
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,880
their first crush.

383
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,719
So you have to be vigilant if there is any trouble.

384
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,280
Stop it at the beginning.

385
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,239
Do you read too many romance novels?

386
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,599
As soon as first crush appeared, the world is turbulent.

387
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Never mind.

388
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,479
And I believe Mo Lingze.

389
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,359
If you love someone, don't doubt him.

390
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,160
What you just said

391
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,040
is the same as what Xu Wei said.

392
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,160
You two are absolutely...

393
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,199
Why did you suddenly mention Xu Wei?

394
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,760
You two?

395
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,239
What's wrong with us?

396
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,040
It's unacceptable,

397
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,079
unimaginable.

398
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
Tang Xi has sent a message.

399
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,359
Take a look.

400
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,050
(See you in the archery range at 7PM)

401
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,839
Miss Xu, I'm sorry.

402
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,239
I can only ask you here.

403
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,119
Because my training time is fixed.

404
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,479
No problem.

405
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,920
Miss Tang,

406
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,760
I broke your clothes last time.

407
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,839
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,079
Thank you.

409
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,520
But clothing is like armor.

410
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,520
People will judge you by what you wear.

411
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,199
I only wear my own clothes.

412
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,160
Is it?

413
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,079
But the things sent out

414
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,719
are old things.

415
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,800
If Miss Tang doesn't like it,

416
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,160
just throw it away.

417
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,040
Miss Xu, you surprised me a lot.

418
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,959
It's better to be open and honest.

419
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,280
I asked you here this time

420
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,239
because I wanted to talk something with you.

421
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:13,719
Go ahead, please.

422
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
If ten is a perfect mark,

423
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
you're beautiful.

424
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,000
Appearance scores 8.1 points.

425
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,079
IQ,

426
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,280
five points.

427
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,400
EQ is 4.5 points.

428
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,400
As for your means,

429
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,000
three points.

430
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,040
On average,

431
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,199
you haven't passed yet.

432
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
I just want to know

433
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,239
why Mo Lingze fell in love with

434
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,680
a woman like you?

435
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,800
It seems that Miss Tang's opinions on women

436
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,359
are not so objective.

437
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,959
You judge the situation and weigh the pros and cons.

438
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,239
What is the result?

439
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,119
What you have gained and what you have lost,

440
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,280
you know better than me.

441
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,560
Excuse me, your coffee.

442
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,199
Thank you.

443
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,000
Thank you.

444
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:09,479
Delicious.

445
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,520
Miss Xu has good taste.

446
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,439
The beans in this café are baked very well.

447
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,839
The taste is particularly delicate.

448
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,719
When I brought Lingze here for the first time,

449
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
he loved it.

450
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,439
I said this cup of coffee is delicious.

451
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,359
It has nothing to do

452
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,520
with you and Mo Lingze.

453
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
I won't say it tastes bad

454
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,599
because it is recommended by you.

455
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,599
Because I never

456
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,319
lie to myself.

457
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,119
The reason is pretty good,

458
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,439
but does Miss Xu really not mind at all?

459
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,280
Do you know

460
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,199
why Lingze always wears black suits?

461
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,239
Because I chose this color for him,

462
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,239
which suits him best.

463
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,680
Lingze was created by me.

464
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,920
Is my aesthetic good?

465
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,520
It's really great.

466
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,839
But since he is with me,

467
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,359
he will have his own appearance.

468
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,040
What I love is the real him,

469
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,479
not the formula that has been worked out.

470
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,800
The real him,

471
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,479
do you know the real him?

472
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,199
Do you know why Lingze

473
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,160
never believes in long-term relationships?

474
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,719
Miss Xu,

475
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,880
why not wait for me to win him back?

476
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,479
Miss Tang,

477
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,119
if you can handle Mo Lingze,

478
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,280
why bother to tell me this?

479
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,479
The result is already clear.

480
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,040
I still have something else. I'll go first.

481
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,640
Thank you for the coffee.

482
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,359
Why are you out?

483
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,319
I made an upgraded caramel cake,

484
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,400
waiting for you outside.

485
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,040
I'll try it.

486
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,000
Why did you change your suit?

487
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,680
You didn't wear this in the morning.

488
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,880
Do you remember so clearly what I wear every day?

489
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,079
Of course.

490
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,640
I remember what you wear every day.

491
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,079
Reward a bite.

492
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,079
Wait a minute.

493
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,199
You answer me first.

494
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,760
Why did you change your clothes?

495
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,319
I went shopping with your sister.

496
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,359
Then why don't you take me when you go shopping?

497
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,520
Why should I take you?

498
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:40,599
Will you pay me the bill?

499
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,439
Do you have money?

500
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,920
I do.

501
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
My money is in Gu Dayan's pocket.

502
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,640
He hasn't given it to me yet.

503
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,880
I'm joking with you.

504
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,079
We talked about adults' things.

505
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,959
It's not adults' business.

506
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,880
It's girls' topic.

507
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,160
Gossip about rival in love.

508
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,359
You can't understand.

509
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,040
Rival in love?

510
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,040
Who?

511
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,839
It has nothing to do with me.

512
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,520
Then it has something to do with my sister.

513
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,160
Who is the rival?

514
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,560
Can you let me have a bite first?

515
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,160
You can talk while eating.

516
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,760
It's a long story.

517
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,560
Take a bite and tell me.

518
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,640
Hang it up. Don't drop it.

519
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:35,880
All right, let's go.

520
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
(We wish each other a long life
to share the beauty in life, even miles apart)

521
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
You look so formal today.

522
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,640
You also wear perfume, right?

523
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,760
Do you want to attract attention?

524
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,599
I'm trying to

525
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,000
prevent mosquitoes.

526
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Although it's a little artificial,

527
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,680
it's okay

528
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,160
as a farewell ceremony.

529
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,839
Farewell ceremony?

530
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,599
Since I have given up Mo Lingze,

531
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,880
our cooperation is coming to an end.

532
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,880
So it's over?

533
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:29,880
You still want me to hold on, right?

534
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,040
You really want me to be a mistress, don't you?

535
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,000
No.

536
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,560
How could I make you a mistress?

537
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,239
So from today,

538
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,079
Wang Ji and Lin Siyu's love-chasing alliance

539
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,000
has officially ended.

540
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
But I believe that

541
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,880
you, as an excellent Party B,

542
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,319
will definitely fulfill Party A's last requirement

543
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,680
before the contract expires.

544
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:03,680
What requirements?

545
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,479
Come with me.

546
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,839
Miss Lin,

547
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,599
why do you want to play this?

548
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:23,119
Are you scared to walk so slowly?

549
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,040
I just want to try your courage.

550
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,160
I walked behind you to protect you.

551
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,920
Really?

552
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,800
If you're not afraid, just take two steps forward.

553
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,280
Don't hold on to it.

554
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,160
You leave it first.

555
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,239
Why should I leave it first?

556
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,319
You're a man, so you leave it first.

557
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,920
What does this have to do with men?

558
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,719
You...

559
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,800
It seems that I have to take measures

560
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,880
to exercise you.

561
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,119
Wang Ji.

562
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,959
What's the matter?

563
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:57,839
I have a stomachache.

564
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,079
I seem to have appendicitis.

565
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,479
Let's go to the hospital.

566
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,719
Go.

567
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,680
Go.

568
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,359
Are you looking for your sister?

569
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,439
For you.
