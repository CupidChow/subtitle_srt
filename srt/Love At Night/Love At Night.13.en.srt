=Episode 13=

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,559
Master, calm down.

4
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,680
Take care of yourself.

5
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:40,599
Youyou, be seated.

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,519
Take your time.

7
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,080
Dad.

8
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,239
I got it all right,

9
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,400
didn't I?

10
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,120
You started to arrange Xu Wei's and my life 
when we were young

11
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,800
because of your prestige and vanity, right?

12
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,879
I won't marry Fan Yunxi.

13
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,959
In the matter of choosing my husband,

15
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,480
I have to make you disappointed.

16
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,120
You...

17
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,720
Master, calm down.

18
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,520
Youyou said that just in a moment of anger.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,199
Quarrels between father and daughter are soon mended.

20
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,440
Don't be worried.

21
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,679
I will persuade her.

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,919
Yunxi.

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,559
I asked you to meet me today for...

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,839
I didn't expect that the matter 
would come to this ending.

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,679
I'm sorry to you!

26
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,720
Master, don't say that.

27
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,720
Whether I can be your son-in-law or not,

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,520
I am always your student.

29
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:43,880
Please be relieved.

30
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,240
I won't make you disappointed

31
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,600
about the matter of Youyou and I.

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,720
Let's go and see it.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,479
Okay, let's go.

34
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,800
Star Tent.

35
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,320
This is the door.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Don't touch it.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,559
You can't get in.

38
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,639
Why?

39
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,440
Can I ask you

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,520
how much is it?

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,399
It's free.

42
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,440
But you can't get in.

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,520
This sign is the instruction to let people in, isn't it?

44
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,360
Exactly.

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,039
We use it privately, can't we?

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,880
Exactly.

47
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,880
You are insane.

48
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,520
Let's go. They are insane.

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,600
Miss Xu and Mr. Mo are not coming for so long a time.

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,559
Is it possible that they won't come?

51
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,080
Are they just colleagues?

52
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,399
How about leaving here?

53
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,720
It would be a waste of my tent.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
It's raining.

55
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,600
It's not.

56
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,279
It's definitely raining.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,479
Come on.

58
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,320
Why is it raining so heavily all of a sudden?

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,199
Yes.

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,880
I remember that when I was a child,

61
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,760
my parents just went out when it was fine,

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
and suddenly it was raining heavily.

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,799
There was a lot of water in my house at that time.

64
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,760
My sister and I were hiding on the table.

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,519
I was very frightened then.

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,559
But I still reassured my sister

67
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,679
and told her not to be scared.

68
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,880
Can you be romantic?

69
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,799
This is a star tent that I ordered.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,760
Although there are no stars right now,

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
you can imagine the raindrops

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
as stars.

73
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:52,720
Look at

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,480
that.

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
Does it look like the Big Dipper?

76
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,760
And that one.

77
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,480
It is shining because of the street lamps.

78
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,399
Does it look like a rhinestone?

79
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,839
Yes, it does.

80
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
I don't need it.

81
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:21,959
Just give it to me.

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,040
You didn't listen to my advice
when choosing a major in college.

83
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,279
And you didn't listen to my advice
when you were looking for a job after graduation.

84
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,760
Why don't you learn the lesson?

85
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:20,200
Look at what you are doing every day

86
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,000
in a small company.

87
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,679
Why did I foster

88
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,200
a disappointing daughter like you?

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,200
What happened?

90
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,119
Is it a business or personal matter?

91
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,720
Dry yourself.

92
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,399
I'll take you to a place.

93
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Where?

94
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,440
Just follow me.

95
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,320
Where are we headed?

96
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,399
My secret base.

97
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:44,799
That's it.

98
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,279
When I was a child,

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
I would say to it when I was unhappy.

100
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,200
If Director Xu doesn't feel childish,

101
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,399
you can have a try.

102
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,559
Hello.

103
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,480
Is that the 18-year-old Xu Qingyou?

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,519
I'm you ten years later.

105
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,440
Since childhood,

106
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,840
everyone praised you for your good behavior,

107
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
obedience and intelligence.

108
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,119
But only I know that

109
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,840
those are the adjectives you hate the most.

110
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,320
So you want to make your own choices

111
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,640
when choosing a major in college,

112
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,119
job and marriage.

113
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,280
Because you don't want your life

114
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,200
to be arranged by others all the time.

115
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,880
Unfortunately, to be yourself

116
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,119
is only the right of children.

117
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,479
When you grow up,

118
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,039
you are not qualified.

119
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,760
If living in accordance with the expectations of others,

120
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,280
is that still your life?

121
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,159
Actually, I think...

122
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,880
I think it's hard to live well on your own.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Your life is always interfered by others,

124
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,919
while you hope that others can understand you.

125
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,239
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,559
I would have talked to you about something happy.

127
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,599
But I'm sorry.

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,640
There is nothing happy recently.

129
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,960
Director Xu.

130
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,919
Don't digest by yourself
when you face something difficult in the future.

131
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,359
Let's go.

132
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:48,960
Youyou.

133
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,039
Don't be angry, okay?

134
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,760
What Master did is for your good.

135
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,000
What I did makes you sad.

136
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:54,919
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,479
Forgive me, will you?

138
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,159
Please give me another chance.

139
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,719
You know that I love you.

140
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,039
Xiaowei.

141
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,679
Two bottles of whiskey for emergency.

142
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:07,799
Okay.

143
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,239
You are drinking single malt whiskey.

144
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,119
You should have gone to my bar.

145
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,039
I still can control

146
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,359
which bar I go to and which bar I don't.

147
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,239
It's a pity!

148
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm afraid that you might miss

149
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,679
the good wine in my bar.

150
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,440
I will take back

151
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,039
the one that shouldn't be missed.

152
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,000
Until now,

153
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,799
everything

154
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,760
is going the way I want.

155
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
This time,

156
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,719
there's no exception.

157
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,760
Don't force yourself.

158
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,320
Let it go.

159
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,320
Why should I let it go?

160
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,359
I have never given up the fight.

161
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,719
I will not lose this time.

162
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,119
As a nodding acquaintance, I give you a piece of advice.

163
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,159
After tonight,

164
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,880
just let it go.

165
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:28,799
Sa.

166
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,080
Thank you.

167
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:30,760
Never mind.

168
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,000
You sit here and wait for me.

169
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:18,760
I didn't notice it.

170
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,080
You are accustomed to putting up with it.

171
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,320
Although change can be troublesome,

172
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,919
it's better than suffering.

173
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,440
What are you thinking about?

174
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
I once said that

175
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,559
you are dangerous.

176
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,320
You also

177
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,440
hoped that I

178
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,520
could get away from your life.

179
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
It seems that you didn't get what you wanted.

180
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,960
You also said that

181
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
life is composed of

182
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,400
one accident after another.

183
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,080
So,

184
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,479
what are you scared of?

185
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm scared of coldness, darkness, dangers,

186
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,200
and accidents in my life.

187
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,679
I didn't expect that you are so timid.

188
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,080
Then you're with me so late.

189
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,679
Are you scared?

190
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,559
Nothing scared.

191
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,880
You are not the one who takes advantage of others.

192
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,400
Or else at the bar...

193
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,520
Are you pleasing me?

194
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,000
But I don't want it.

195
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,960
Xu Qingyou.

196
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,080
I've been waiting for you to make a decision.

197
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,200
But I don't want to wait now.

198
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
There will be a performance at the bar 
at nine o'clock tomorrow night.

199
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,559
Come to me if you have the answer.

200
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,679
It's up to you.

201
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,080
I believe that you won't cheat yourself.

202
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,400
Hello.

203
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,760
I'll fetch the necklace tomorrow.

204
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,960
You finally decided to send it to someone.

205
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,159
It seems that something serious will happen.

206
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,159
Unless something unexpected happens,

207
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,840
it should be.

208
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,559
There is only one necklace like this.

209
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,320
I really want to meet

210
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,559
your Kepler's Supernova.

211
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,400
Let's flip a coin to decide.

212
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,400
If head is up, I will send you home.

213
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,520
If tail is up,

214
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,800
I will send you to the police station.

215
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,680
Head up, go.

216
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,880
Tail up, stay.

217
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,400
Sa.

218
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,239
You have to talk with Luo.

219
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,599
He doesn't rehearse carefully every day.

220
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
He doesn't practice the bass either.

221
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,920
Who are you speaking ill of?

222
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,359
I said it so slightly. How come you hear it?

223
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,479
Nonsense.

224
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,160
My hearing is good as a bass player, okay?

225
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,560
Enough.

226
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,719
You should...

227
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,479
Reserve the Seat One for me.

228
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,920
Okay.

229
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,239
Something will happen today.

230
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,460
(Reserved)

231
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:32,960
(Reserved)

232
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,839
Hello.

233
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,599
Hello.

234
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,280
You come here so early.

235
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,719
The band is rehearsing.

236
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,239
What do you want to drink?

237
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,119
Which one is popular?

238
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,479
There you go.

239
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,839
I will make you special flavoring.

240
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,119
Be sweeter.

241
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:13,599
Okay.

242
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,830
(Nana, curly hair, elegant but tough)

243
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,530
(Yangyang, lovely and  obedient)

244
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,920
This is the Peach Blossom Treasure of Lingze.

245
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,959
Bobo has recorded it carefully for several years.

246
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,920
This is the treasure of guarding the bar.

247
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,319
Is this Mo Lingze's?

248
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,280
(Lin Siyu, spoiled, silly but rich)
This is mine.

249
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,500
(Lin Siyu, spoiled, silly but rich)

250
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,359
Don't you mind?

251
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,119
Of course not.

252
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:51,599
Even if there are many women who like him,

253
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
I am always the most special one.

254
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,760
Xu Qingyou.

255
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,400
A prudery female white-collar

256
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,839
between maturity and naivety

257
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,319
who doesn't like challenging,

258
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,359
and gets used to escaping.

259
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,079
Are you at the bar?

260
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,119
Why didn't I see you?

261
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,359
Good morning.

262
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,319
Good morning, Director Xu.

263
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,079
Director Xu, why do you have dark circle?

264
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,520
Didn't you have a good sleep yesterday?

265
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,319
I didn't sleep well.

266
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,079
Wang Ji.

267
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,199
Go to the car and bring me Fang Qi's

268
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,599
resource due diligence report.

269
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:45,680
Okay.

270
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:53,640
What are you doing?

271
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,040
What exactly do you mean?

272
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,760
I want to ask you what exactly you mean.

273
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,800
Mr. Mo, I appreciate that

274
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,640
you helped me a lot before.

275
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,079
I will do my best

276
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,479
at work in the future.

277
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,640
In addition to work,

278
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,079
let's keep up distance.

279
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,880
Do you want to draw a demarcation line with me again?

280
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:15,640
Mr. Mo, you must be joking.

281
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,520
Isn't there always a line between us?

282
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,000
Qingyou.

283
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,400
Yu Ming asked me to take a leave of absence for him.

284
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,160
Something happened at his home.

285
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,359
Has he finished writing the script 
of the joint live broadcast yet?

286
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,560
Well.

287
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,760
Qingyou, I'll write it for him.

288
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,640
I have ever written the script of the live broadcast.

289
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,760
I guarantee to fulfil the task.

290
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,040
Dapang.

291
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,199
Didn't you say you are meeting your friends
to watch football tonight?

292
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,800
Work first,

293
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,760
and life second.

294
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,040
By the way, Qingyou.

295
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,280
The list of the live broadcast has not been checked.

296
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,479
I am familiar with it.

297
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,079
I'll do it.

298
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,359
How about this way?

299
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,719
You cooperate to write the script of the live broadcast.

300
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,199
I'll check the list.

301
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,400
Okay.

302
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,000
Go ahead.

303
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,400
Let's go ahead.

304
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,839
Hello, what's the matter with you, my lord?

305
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,400
Qingyou.

306
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,719
Do you know

307
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,040
what Fang Qi's unknown hobbies are?

308
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,280
What do you intend to do?

309
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:17,880
Listen to me.

310
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
Fang Qi helped our family

311
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,599
to solve so big a trouble.

312
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,239
I have to express my gratitude.

313
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,520
Personally speaking,

314
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,880
we are siblings.

315
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:27,880
Generally speaking,

316
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm a down-and-out artist,

317
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,520
while you're an urban female white-collar.

318
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,760
What's wrong with a female white-collar?

319
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,680
People who label others casually

320
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,640
and don't know how to respect others 
should be despised.

321
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,920
What did I do to piss her off?

322
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,319
I am keeping

323
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:55,599
having meetings,

324
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:55,719
and having meetings.

325
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,439
I can't bear it anymore.

326
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:59,319
It's inhumane.

327
00:23:59,319 --> 00:23:59,920
Exactly.

328
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,599
Why do you abhor evil as a deadly foe today?

329
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,119
Is it possible

330
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,119
that we are both thinking of the same person?

331
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,599
Do you know that Poker Face

332
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,119
has a roster full of girls' names?

333
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,599
The one who doesn't like challenging

334
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,400
and gets use to escaping

335
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,479
is me.

336
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,599
You label yourself

337
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,880
just because of those words on it.

338
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:27,520
Are you kidding me?

339
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,599
Isn't the cream expensive?

340
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,920
It's unworthy to make you grow wrinkles.

341
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,599
Besides,

342
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,160
he said that I am a prudery female white-collar.

343
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,920
Am I prudery?

344
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,160
I dare to give you a guarantee that

345
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,040
you are real from head to toe, okay?

346
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,160
Tell me.

347
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,800
Am I a girl between maturity and sexuality?

348
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,400
No.

349
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,680
Between naivety and sexuality.

350
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,839
A thing is valued if it is rare.

351
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,520
Do you understand it?

352
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,119
A thing is valued if it is rare.

353
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,520
He labels women casually.

354
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,959
Does he think that we will

355
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,280
always live in their evaluation?

356
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,839
Vulgar and narrow-minded.

357
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,560
He just thinks that he's handsome.

358
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,479
So, he thinks that the beautiful women in the world

359
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,640
are waiting to be selected by him.

360
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,079
he needs to take a good look at himself in the mirror.

361
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,680
He can't look himself in the mirror.

362
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,640
After looking himself in the mirror,

363
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:36,119
he will be confident.

364
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,760
I had thought that

365
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,920
life had given me a prize.

366
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,640
But when I scratched it,

367
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,079
it still writes "thank you".

368
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,839
Xu Qingyou.

369
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,839
The water shrinking from your bosom

370
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,959
is all flowing into your brain.

371
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,719
No personal abuse.

372
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,439
You and I are the same.

373
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,540
(Xu Wei)

374
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,800
Xu Qingyou.

375
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,719
In my view,

376
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,479
you

377
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,319
have to dry the water in your head as soon as possible.

378
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,920
Poker face is not fit for you in character.

379
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,959
It's true. You must listen to me.

380
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,359
Listen to me.

381
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,199
I don't care about what losses I have suffered before.

382
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,959
But I can't stand to

383
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,560
suffer losses from him.

384
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,160
Beat him.

385
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,959
Beat him.

386
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,880
Good job!

387
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,880
Good job!

388
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,079
Can't you just let me go?

389
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,959
It's really not interesting to play games with you.

390
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,760
I don't want to play with you.

391
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,560
If you leave,

392
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,680
I'll invest in the hot pot restaurant 
across the street from yours.

393
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,680
You know that

394
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,400
my family lives on the hot pot restaurant.

395
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,239
She just didn't figure it out

396
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,160
instead of drawing a demarcation line with you.

397
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,920
Why are you so angry?

398
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,640
Even if she draws a demarcation line with you,

399
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,119
she doesn't make a final decision.

400
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,439
Why are you angry alone?

401
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,160
Get in.

402
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,959
Move. Quickly.

403
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,839
What are you doing?

404
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,400
Listen to me.

405
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,359
Later on, if I

406
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,520
look at Mo Lingze again, I admit defeat.

407
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,000
Did you get it?

408
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:34,719
Hello.

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,599
Let's go.

410
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:39,040
I have kept your license plate number in mind.

411
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,000
Call me when you arrive home.

412
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,040
You always like to stare at the outside by yourself.

413
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,880
It's not interesting to see the darkness.

414
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,839
I'll light it up for you.

415
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,359
And you will be more pleased.

416
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,000
Hello.

417
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,400
Hello.

418
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,239
Hello.

419
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,280
Do you know about love?

420
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,359
Love.

421
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,479
Do you know about it?

422
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,000
Miss.

423
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,400
You need to pay 200 yuan to me if you vomit on my car.

424
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,319
You understand nothing.

425
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,199
I will pay you 200 yuan if you play games with him.

426
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,319
No. I don't want to play it.

427
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:47,800
Two hundred yuan.

428
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,079
I don't want to ask for an insult.

429
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:49,719
Please.

430
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,199
Round one.

431
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,000
Ready, go.

432
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,000
Why a girl

433
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,319
who had a good attitude

434
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,520
suddenly changed her attitude?

435
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,520
White-collar?

436
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,760
Reply to me.

437
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,880
She has more than one option, 
so she can choose anyone.

438
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,439
You can never judge someone by appearance.

439
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,959
The sea cannot be measured with a bushel.

440
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,520
Maybe she is a playa.

441
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,400
It's not easy for me to defeat you. Don't go.

442
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,199
Mo, your coat is here.

443
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,000
Don't forget it later.

444
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,640
Bobo.

445
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:39,640
What's that?

446
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,560
Mo.

447
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,280
What's this? Is it customized?

448
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:44,319
I am going to open it.

449
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,000
Hot pot restaurant.

450
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Your phone keeps ringing.

451
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,300
(17 missed calls from Xu Qingyou)

452
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,439
Who are you?

453
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,640
Come down.

454
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,800
You don't know me?

455
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,959
Do you live in the neighborhood?

456
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,640
Of course, yes.

457
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,400
Which building do you live in?

458
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Just guess it.

459
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,719
I'll show you a performance.

460
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,760
Actually, I'm good at it.

461
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,760
One, two, three, four.

462
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:43,119
You don't need to wear clothes of famous brand.

463
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,880
It's brilliant if your hair dances with wind.

464
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
Dude, do you know her?

465
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,680
I don't know her.

466
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,560
I know him.

467
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,239
Don't go, dude.

468
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:55,280
Just let him go. It's okay.

469
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,119
I'll call him.

470
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,560
He will come here once I call him.

471
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,599
Quarrels of youngsters

472
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,800
can be understood.

473
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,079
But it's irresponsible

474
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,079
to let a girl drink booze.

475
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,119
I...

476
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,680
A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets.

477
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:11,680
If a man

478
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,599
wants to keep the love of a woman,

479
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,439
he can't only depend on appearance.

480
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Take her home quickly.

481
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,560
Hurry up!

482
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:20,719
Hurry up!

483
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,239
Okay.
