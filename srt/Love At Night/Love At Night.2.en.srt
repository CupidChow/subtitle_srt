3
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:37,480
Director Xu.

4
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:39,680
Remember to pay me for the room.

5
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,580
( Director, Department I)

6
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,980
( Products Introduction of Lemi )

7
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,520
Director Xu.

8
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,759
Remember to pay me for the room.

9
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,559
(Sending friend request)
For the room charge.

10
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,320
(Mo Lingze)
Still remember what happened last night.

11
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,479
I hope we're quits

12
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,279
and let it go as soon as possible.

13
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,000
Excuse me.

14
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,600
Could you please give this to that man?

15
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Who's "that man"?

16
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
A member in the band.

17
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,479
Sa...

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Could you tell me where Lingze is?

19
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,320
He's yours.

20
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,440
Not mine.

21
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,279
How could I know where he is?

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
He never answers my calls

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,119
or texts me back.

24
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
He was purposely ignoring me?

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Girl.

26
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,839
You have to hurry.

27
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,759
Mo is particularly popular.

28
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,800
Sure enough, a playboy.

29
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm not in a hurry.

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,080
Sorry to bother you.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
You're the white-collar, aren't you?

32
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,639
You also come to Mo?

33
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,600
No.

34
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,759
I just come to return something.

35
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,320
Thank you.

36
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:50,800
See?

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,039
The fourth girl in this month.

38
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,639
What a playboy!

39
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,520
I have to write it down.

40
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,720
Even such a trifle?

41
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,800
It's what I should do as a mate.

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,639
What did she ask you to hand over?

43
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
How can I know?

44
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,639
(Fan Yunxi)
Youyou.

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,519
I'm waiting for you in the bridal chamber.

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,399
Let's talk calmly.

47
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
How can we give up the ten-year relationship?

48
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,359
I won't leave until you come.

49
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,760
What do you want to talk?

50
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,359
You told me, right?

51
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,559
You want to marry before you're 30.

52
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,679
You want to move out.

53
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,040
I've imagined numerous times the life

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,040
after we live together.

55
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,160
Our dream is coming true.

56
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,200
Please forgive me.

57
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,799
I can't.

58
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,359
Youyou.

59
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,679
It's just an incident in our life.

60
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,959
Believe me.

61
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,079
It's gonna be over soon.

62
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,119
Fan Yunxi.

63
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,279
It's not an incident.

64
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,399
Not everything's gotta to be over.

65
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,959
Maybe you can make it.

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,679
But I can't.

67
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
No one can promise

68
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,600
he will never make a mistake.

69
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm just hoping you give me a chance.

70
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,920
Look at everything in this house.

71
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,760
They're your favorites.

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
We've been looking forward to the day for so long.

73
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,320
Are you really willing to give up?

74
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:32,799
You're right.

75
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,079
Life is so long.

76
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,920
Once I accept the false beauty,

77
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,079
I may live in the sham all my life.

78
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,000
Like your lie,

79
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,200
it broke with a simple touch.

80
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,160
I won't break up with you.

81
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,359
Is there any follow-up of Fan Yunxi?

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,640
Yes.

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,160
He told me a lot.

84
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,119
But it didn't work.

85
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:27,839
Well.

86
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,079
Let's go for something exciting this weekend.

87
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,239
Roller Coaster

88
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,160
or Room Escape?

89
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,679
Stimulus is called for.

90
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,200
Go to Room Escape on your own.

91
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,279
Don't worry. I'm here.

92
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,200
So what?

93
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,079
And I just feel bored.

94
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,679
Precisely why you need to go now.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,279
The more exciting, the...

96
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,799
Good morning, Mr. Mo.

97
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,640
Come in.

98
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Go ahead.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,480
What's up?

100
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:22,839
Mr. Mo.

101
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,760
Let's get straight to the point.

102
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,720
I hope you can forget what happened before.

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,200
Otherwise, it will affect our work.

104
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:30,880
Forget what?

105
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,760
Forget what you shouldn't remember.

106
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,039
What if it's too impressive to forget?

107
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,200
Mr. Mo.

108
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,640
We're just for fun.

109
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Don't take it serious.

110
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,440
It seems you're quite a dab hand.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,919
Takes one to know one.

112
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:52,039
Your ears are hot already.

113
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Why not come in, Director Xu?

114
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,440
Hello, Shangger.

115
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Leader is a promising enterprise

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
after preliminary screening.

117
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,239
Its business includes amusement arcades and parks,

118
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,559
cinemas and situational games.

119
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,799
A complete product line.

120
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:29,880
A promising prospect.

121
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,359
Amusement parks are small.

122
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,880
Facilities are stale.

123
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,479
The target acceptors are not made determinate.

124
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,880
Cinema profits are passable at the first glance.

125
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,520
But in this area

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,799
it's much lower than nearby Wanda and Stellar.

127
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,359
Attendance is poor.

128
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,679
Target sales are lower.

129
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,400
Is this the result of your due diligence?

130
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,400
The poor attendance

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
is because they haven't updated the decoration.

132
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,520
Advertising has failed to keep pace.

133
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,239
I think these disadvantages are potentialities.

134
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,159
We can improve them one by one after our investment.

135
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,799
I don't care about your standard

136
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,080
before I get here.

137
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,599
But I have to tell you.

138
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,799
Shangger is an investment firm

139
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,119
not for charity.

140
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,000
Tapping and cultivating potential projects

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,799
is also one of the businesses of us.

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
If 80 percent of our projects

143
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
are hard to handle,

144
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,200
I wonder how we can get our annual profits.

145
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,119
But...

146
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,880
Give me a new

147
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,080
due diligence instruction in three days.

148
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,599
No problem.

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
Miss White-collar is generous!

150
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,359
Mo is worth so little?

151
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,880
It seemed she received poor service.

152
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,200
A bad experience.

153
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,320
No wonder she said

154
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,280
she didn't want to get involved in your business.

155
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,559
Go to Room Escape on your own.

156
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,479
Don't worry. I'm here.

157
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,479
So what?

158
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,880
Precisely why you need to go now.

159
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,159
The more exciting, the more interesting.

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,000
You said there were situational games in Leader?

161
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,960
Yes.

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,559
The situational game

163
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,960
is the most popular Room

164
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,200
on social networking websites now.

165
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,359
The ace project of Leader.

166
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,080
Style?

167
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,559
It focuses on real scene restoration and thrill.

168
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,880
I'll conduct field research if you want more details.

169
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Leave it to me.

170
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,960
It may be inappropriate if you go to finish it, Mr. Mo.

171
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,280
The more exciting, the more interesting.

172
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,479
Right?

173
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,159
Qingyou.

174
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,479
Here's the proposal of Meeting Your Match.

175
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,159
Please look it over.

176
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,520
If there are no problems, please sign here.

177
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Great progress, Meng.

178
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,640
OK.

179
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,919
Let's follow this plan first.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,479
OK.

181
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,039
(Mo Lingze, Themed Room Escape)
Come here.

182
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,719
Mr. Mo.

183
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Text the wrong person?

184
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,119
We're even if you come.

185
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,440
I've paid for the room.

186
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,719
Director Xu.

187
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,200
It's from Shangger.

188
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,320
Thanks.

189
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,119
What do you want from me?

190
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Don't you want to let it go?

191
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,840
Sorry, sorry.

192
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,400
Sorry.

193
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,000
My bad. My bad.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,280
My bad. Please.

195
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,119
It's me.

196
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,080
Mo Lingze, why do you choose this place?

197
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,239
I thought Director Xu wanted to make it clear

198
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,320
with nobody listening to it.

199
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,520
I do like quiet places

200
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,440
but not here.

201
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,760
So? You're afraid?

202
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,119
I thought you were good at playing.

203
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:18,919
Speak up.

204
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,840
What do you want me to do?

205
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,960
To beat the game.

206
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,440
Then I'll let it go.

207
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,320
Do you think I'm idle

208
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,200
or you're idle?

209
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,280
Of course I'm idle.

210
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,119
I haven't met such an interesting woman for so long.

211
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,799
It is understandable.

212
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:31,880
OK.

213
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,039
No problem.

214
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,479
You'll forget it if I beat the game, right?

215
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,559
You got my word.

216
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,159
Go ahead.

217
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,000
You.

218
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:39,679
Fine.

219
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,799
Don't try to test me.

220
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,919
I will not give other women

221
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,400
any chances as the princess of Gold Sun.

222
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,239
Lingze's car.

223
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Don't try to get rid of me.

224
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,039
You nearly caused a crash!

225
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,479
Where's Lingze? Are you his driver?

226
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm the investment manager.

227
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,760
You're the fangirl of Mr. Mo.

228
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,840
His girlfriend in the future.

229
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,000
Golden Sun Capital.

230
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,440
The same trade.

231
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,520
But

232
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,880
your title is a little low as a trainee.

233
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,010
(Wang Ji, Shangger)

234
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,039
Did Shangger let anyone

235
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,239
be the manager these days?

236
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,000
Although I'm an intern,

237
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,919
Mr. Lin of Golden Sun is my Dad.

238
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,520
You're Miss Lin.

239
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,320
Shall I call my Dad?

240
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,919
No no.

241
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:11,919
Nice to meet you.

242
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,479
How's Lingze doing?

243
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,520
Did he eat well?

244
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,239
Did he sleep well?

245
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,359
Is there any woman badgering him?

246
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,400
Miss Lin.

247
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,159
These are Mr. Mo's privacy.

248
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,799
It's nothing serious.

249
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,239
I mean we go way back.

250
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,640
You're Mr. Mo's...

251
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,679
You've finally realized it.

252
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,159
No wonder he's smiling a lot lately.

253
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,000
Really?

254
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,280
It's true to overcome firmness by gentleness.

255
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,799
To overcome firmness by gentleness? How?

256
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,799
It's not late to quit now.

257
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,359
I won't.

258
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,280
Do you need any help?

259
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:08,680
No.

260
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,119
Keep your hands off me.

261
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,920
But you never kept your hands off me.

262
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,920
It was totally a mistake that night.

263
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,920
Forget it

264
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,719
if I beat the game.

265
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,920
On the premise of beating the game.

266
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,160
OK. No problem.

267
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,319
OK.

268
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,439
Dear players.

269
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,520
Time's up.

270
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,920
The exit will open for you.

271
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,640
Challenge failed.

272
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,920
Welcome to come here again.

273
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,160
Mr. Mo.

274
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,079
Actually you're enjoying making me look like a fool.

275
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,040
I didn't expect you have such a strong prejudice 
against me.

276
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,239
Prejudice?

277
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,160
I don't think so.

278
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,560
You had an urge to let it go?

279
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:27,680
Yes.

280
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,400
Because it should not have happened.

281
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,400
But it happened for sure.

282
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,400
We can erase it.

283
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,560
There shouldn't be so many connections between us.

284
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,400
But the challenge failed.

285
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,359
It would let you down, Director Xu.

286
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,719
I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

287
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,199
Hey, hey, hey!

288
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,640
It's me.

289
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,160
Xu Wei, you're killing yourself.

290
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,920
You're not supposed to be so faint-hearted.

291
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,400
Afraid of darkness, ghosts and Dad.

292
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,920
I'll wring your neck.

293
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,839
Qingyou.

294
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,560
Qingyou, my bad, my bad.

295
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,920
It's all my fault.

296
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,199
Now I see that I was wrong.

297
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
Because of what?

298
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:52,800
What's wrong with your luggage?

299
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,000
Go home.

300
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:55,800
Go home?

301
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,599
You quit school?

302
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,040
I've graduated.

303
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,239
You're talking nonsense!

304
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,400
You should spend five years on college.

305
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:08,920
I, your younger brother, am a genius.

306
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,839
It took me four years to finish the five-year study.

307
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,239
And I got the first prize.

308
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,119
Really?

309
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,880
You're not cheating, are you?

310
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,239
Art will never tell a lie.

311
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:22,000
You said you would become a master before.

312
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,719
What happened? You gave up your dream?

313
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,400
I came back for inspiration

314
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,760
because of my dream.

315
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,959
Are you artists so metaphysical?

316
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,079
I refused all admissions of MFA.

317
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,400
I'm not kidding.

318
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,520
You won't get an MFA's degree? 
Do parents know about it?

319
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:35,800
No.

320
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,760
Never tell them the truth.

321
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,920
If they know about it,

322
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,119
I will die undoubtedly.

323
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,199
Then you'll lose

324
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,400
your cute and attractive younger brother.

325
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,239
They'd better throw you away.

326
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
You're so cruel.

327
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,239
Do you know

328
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,800
my dream since my childhood?

329
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,160
What?

330
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,880
To be an only child.

331
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,800
How can you say that to your brother?

332
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:01,920
All right.

333
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,439
Dad and Mom will be back in two weeks.

334
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,599
Keep your secret.

335
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,520
Don't spill the beans.

336
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,040
OK.

337
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,040
Qingyou.

338
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,319
Can you do me a favor?

339
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,520
Please help me find out if your firm

340
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,800
or my brother-in-law needs someone

341
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,199
to draw decorative paintings.

342
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,119
I'll go to work with Gu Dayan.

343
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,000
He deserves to get some businesses.

344
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,079
Don't bother Fan Yunxi.

345
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,920
I will help you with what you said.

346
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,280
But your efforts are the most important.

347
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,079
What's wrong with you?

348
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,239
He'll become our family soon.

349
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,119
Isn't it natural to ask my

350
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,719
brother-in-law to help me?

351
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,160
Why are you so independent?

352
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,560
Don't guess what women think.

353
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
OK. I can't read your thoughts.

354
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Any follow-up?

355
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:58,920
Who?

356
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,359
The white-collar.

357
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,160
She didn't hit your fancy?

358
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,880
That's natural.

359
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,439
Not your type at a glance.

360
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,199
What type should I be attracted to?

361
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,920
Sago cycas seldom blossoms.

362
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,959
Hello, Sa.

363
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,839
I want to book the whole bar for a party this weekend.

364
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,040
Weekend?

365
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,599
How many people?

366
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,119
Mask party.

367
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,599
About 60 people.

368
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Will the Sad Band

369
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
perform at that time?

370
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,239
Pay extra for it.

371
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,239
Money is not an issue.

372
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,479
It's enough that the band can perform.

373
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,239
Especially the good-looking guitarist.

374
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,479
OK.

375
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,280
That's settled then.

376
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,880
OK. Thank you.

377
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,439
Keep your place for me.

378
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:09,920
There will be an event?

379
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,839
A girl will have a party.

380
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,400
And you're asked to be present.

381
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm busy.

382
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,479
You have to come.

383
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,520
No way.

384
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,640
Who's it?

385
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,959
What are you doing?

386
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,920
Xu Wei.

387
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,520
You've been back.

388
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,959
You still have one year left, right?

389
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,040
You still remember the date I come back.

390
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,400
You were expelled from school

391
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,760
or repatriated?

392
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,719
Don't jinx me!

393
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,119
I've completed my credit

394
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,359
and graduated one year ahead of time.

395
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,959
Fine. All in all, it's great.

396
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,760
What is the smell?

397
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
You're killing me.

398
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,479
Where's your elder sister?

399
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,160
She's sleeping.

400
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,400
Who is it that you drew?

401
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,560
Just a person.

402
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,880
Tell me the truth.

403
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,520
A girl.

404
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,239
You have a girl in your heart.

405
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,239
Kid.

406
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,040
I'm not a little boy.

407
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,160
Fine.

408
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,680
Princess Xu.

409
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,319
Time to get up.

410
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,280
Time to get up.

411
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,000
No no no.

412
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,319
Just a disappointment in love.

413
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,079
You're decadent now.

414
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,560
Hurry up. You've slept for so long.

415
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,640
Don't look down upon me.

416
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm too tired and busy at ordinary times.

417
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,560
Come and sleep with me.

418
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,239
I must get my beauty sleep.

419
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,319
Your words don't matter.

420
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,719
Hurry up.

421
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,280
I'm going to dress you up and

422
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,560
go to a party today.

423
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,439
Come on.

424
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,760
Every time we go to a party

425
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,479
you're looking for handsome guys.

426
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,239
Then I'm looking for you.

427
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,119
I won't go.

428
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,479
So boring.

429
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,920
Who told you that?

430
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,800
You have to be with handsome guys

431
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,319
so that you can get rid of

432
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,079
the memory about Fan Yunxi.

433
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,800
I don't have to.

434
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,719
I need sleep.

435
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,079
Youyou, look at me.

436
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,119
Charming, attractive but weak.

437
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,640
Who will take me home if I'm drunk?

438
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,560
You? Charming and weak?

439
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,000
You would be Mulan
(*A strong girl who disguised as man in the army)

440
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,800
if you were born in ancient times.

441
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,319
-Go with me or not?  -I'll go.

442
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,079
I'll go.

443
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,160
Take me with you.

444
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,439
I can take you home

445
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,439
if you're drunk.

446
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,680
Stay out of it.

447
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,280
We won't take a child.

448
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,800
Get out.

449
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,760
Get out.

450
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,520
Can you move quickly

451
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,040
since we've reached the door?

452
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,359
Are you sure I should dress like this

453
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,719
to come to the mask party?

454
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,680
Are you questioning my taste?

455
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,239
Besides,

456
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,640
what are you afraid of since we'll wear a mask?

457
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,680
I worry that you're sad alone at home.

458
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,800
I'm telling you.

459
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,400
There's a special event tonight.

460
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,920
Just for once.

461
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,119
Let's go.

462
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,719
I'm the VIP here. No queuing up.

463
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,719
I'm telling you.

464
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,239
All present today are social elites,

465
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,359
investment leaders

466
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
and financial celebrities.

467
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,520
You have to take one

468
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,400
since I've dressed you up.

469
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,160
Otherwise

470
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,920
you'll never rise to the very top.

471
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
I've long stopped daydreaming.

472
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,880
I think it's better to get a promotion or a raise.

473
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,719
You've depended on yourself for 30 years.

474
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,800
I hope this isn't too much.

475
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,119
How about you?

476
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,359
You!

477
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,439
The two o'clock position.

478
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,880
Elegant and moderate.

479
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,400
A high-flyer deserves your investment.

480
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,119
You can see him clearly even he's with such a big mask?

481
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,479
Of course.

482
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,839
Hurry up!

483
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,439
Go!

484
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,359
What's this?

485
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,760
Lottery.

486
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,920
Everyone has one.

487
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:12,760
Hello.

488
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,599
I'm Sa, the boss here.

489
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,119
Welcome to Sad Bar.

490
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,439
Have fun tonight

491
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,439
and enjoy the mask party.

492
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:26,359
Now let's give a round of applause to

493
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:28,640
Miss Lin, the protagonist today.

494
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,719
Lin Siyu, the daughter 
of the chairman of Golden Sun Capital.

495
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,680
Let's have a good time

496
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,479
and enjoy ourselves tonight.

497
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,520
My treat.

498
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,520
Terrific!

499
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,479
Average-looking.

500
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,319
Not as pretty as you.

501
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,479
-Miss Lin...  -Stop teasing.

502
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,040
She prepared a special surprise for you.

503
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,760
You've got your number plate.

504
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,439
After a while, we will draw two lucky ones.

505
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,280
They'll become the special couple tonight.

506
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,280
You didn't tell me that.

507
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,439
I didn't know, either.

508
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,199
I was thinking

509
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,719
why I got a plate of public baths.

510
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,839
It was for this.

511
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,599
You told me it was for lottery.

512
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,520
Yes.

513
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,640
The special couple is the prize.

514
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,680
Boring.

515
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,920
It may not be you.

516
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,079
Come on.

517
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,560
What I got was No. 99 and No. 17.

518
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm No. 99.

519
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,760
What a coincidence!

520
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,280
Congratulations!

521
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,760
Thank you.

522
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,920
It is too fake.

523
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,000
Where's my No. 17?

524
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,839
Where's my No. 17?

525
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,119
Where's my couple?

526
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,560
Who did it?

527
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,479
That's all for your marriage.

528
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,959
Plate lottery for you.

529
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,079
Where's my No. 17?

530
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,560
Where's my couple?

531
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,000
Lin.

532
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,719
You're not No. 99.

533
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,880
It's No. 66.

534
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,119
I'm not No. 66?

535
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,359
You're No. 99.

536
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,439
Congratulations! Hurry up!

537
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,680
Where's the No. 99?

538
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,880
Here!

539
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,680
She's the No. 99.

540
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,079
Are you crazy?

541
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,119
I'll give the opportunity to you, girl!

542
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,680
-You're welcome. Go ahead.  -Fang Qi.

543
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,239
Fang Qi.

544
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,439
Come on!

545
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,680
So unreliable is Bobo.

546
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,560
He even confused No. 99 and No. 66.

547
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,239
Where's No. 17?

548
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,719
-Here!  -He's here!

549
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,040
-He's here!  -I won't go!

550
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,439
I'll help you take off the mask.

551
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:50,959
Come on.

552
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,640
Hold out your hands.

553
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
Your hands, please.

554
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,640
It doesn't matter.

555
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,079
She needs practice.

556
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,599
You can make it!

557
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,079
Now that our guitarist has been drawn,

558
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,839
shouldn't you perform for us?

559
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:23,239
Performance! Performance! Performance!

560
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:24,880
Come here.

561
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,199
What are you going to do?

562
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,280
To play the guitar.

563
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,959
I can do nothing. What should I do?

564
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,119
Don't move. Follow me.

565
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,160
Hold it tight.

566
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,160
Are you ready?

567
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,959
(Fang Qi)
Do you want me to pick you up?

568
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,040
I'll give an opportunity to you.

569
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,280
It's on the way after dinner.

570
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,199
What do you want from me?

571
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,800
I just want to help you solve the problem.

572
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,479
If you really want to do that,

573
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
then forget what happened.

574
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,920
You're good at flattering yourself.

575
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,520
What did you think

576
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,880
happened to us that night?
