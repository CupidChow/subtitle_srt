=Episode 12=

3
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,839
Bye.

4
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,519
Bye-bye.

5
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,039
See you next time, superstar.

6
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,000
Bye-bye.

7
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,320
Hello,

8
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,440
what's up?

9
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,960
Your behavior

10
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,279
has caused damage to others' health.

11
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,600
According to the noise management measures,

12
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,800
the noise control time is

13
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,399
from 10PM to 6AM of the next day.

14
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,440
If the communication is invalid,

15
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,160
you will face

16
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,240
legal prosecution

17
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,679
and compensation

18
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,039
for the victim's examination and treatment costs.

19
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,399
The owner next door complained that

20
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,559
someone was making noise.

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,160
These are all his original words.

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,320
He asked me to convey what he said exactly.

23
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,199
In fact, if there is any problem,

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,039
he can communicate with me directly.

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,039
He said he didn't want to waste time.

26
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,720
OK.

27
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,240
Well.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,160
I see. Thank you.

29
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,080
Thank you.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,399
According to public property regulations,

31
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,600
it is forbidden to pile sundries in public walkways.

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
If you don't clean them up within a day,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
I will sue you.

34
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,440
These are also his original words.

35
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,199
I'm running errands for him.

36
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,080
Okay, I'll clean them up right away.

37
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,199
Please help me tell the owner that

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
I have caused him trouble.

39
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,000
But he doesn't need to focus on me.

40
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
OK, thank you for your cooperation.

41
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,199
Can I help you?

42
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:07,919
No,

43
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,399
I can do it.

44
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:09,440
OK.

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:09,880
Thank you.

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,440
Xu Qingyou?

47
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,320
Mr. Mo?

48
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:35,200
So you reported me, right?

49
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,399
What a surprise.

50
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,519
Every time you appear

51
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,799
in a special way.

52
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,399
Likewise.

53
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,359
It's not easy to be your neighbor.

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
In this case,

55
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,880
we are all acquaintances.

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,119
I'll withdraw my prosecution.

57
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:51,959
Thank you.

58
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,559
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,200
Mr. Mo?

60
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,079
Miss Xu?

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,480
You two know each other?

62
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
No.

63
00:04:59,119 --> 00:04:59,760
Mr. Mo,

64
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,640
do I need to

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,320
convey your complaint

66
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,559
about Miss Xu's unauthorized occupation
of the public aisle?

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,839
No.

68
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,720
OK.

69
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,880
What a coincidence, Mr. Mo.

70
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,519
It seems that you don't like such coincidence.

71
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,880
Of course not.

72
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
But it's really surprising.

73
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
Fang Qi said,

74
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,119
she had to punch in at 9:30
every morning in Shangger.

75
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,320
I thought Mr. Mo would give a lead.

76
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,720
Workers in Lemi go to work
at ten o'clock every day.

77
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,600
You go out now.

78
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,679
Are you avoiding me, aren't you?

79
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,559
There is no need for this.

80
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,480
That's good.

81
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,399
Please.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,119
You moved across from Poker Face.

83
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,959
Are you following his steps like a couple?

84
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,880
Don't talk nonsense.

85
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,119
He appeared everywhere I went.

86
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,839
Otherwise, I move to another house.

87
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,119
Do you have to move

88
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,040
to avoid trouble?

89
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,160
Moving out from your parents is self-reliance.

90
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,720
What's the matter with you hiding from Poker Face?

91
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:12,959
I tell you.

92
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,320
There are only two attitudes to deal with a man,

93
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,799
either put him down

94
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,880
or let him out.

95
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,119
Yes.

96
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,239
Just let him out.

97
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,959
Let Poker Face out.

98
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,039
Is there a handsome guy?

99
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,000
What a coincidence.

100
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,679
I can meet you everywhere.

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Yeah.

102
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,520
What a coincidence.

103
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,679
Who do you want to get out early?

104
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,760
We were just talking about the ball game.

105
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,919
One goal out.

106
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,239
It's a pity.

107
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,440
In this case,

108
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
I hope we can break through all the way

109
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
in both work and life in the future.

110
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,520
No one should be out early.

111
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,760
Of course.

112
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,799
Look at your timid expression.

113
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,359
Poker Face is a hard mode for you.

114
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:19,200
Don't lose your momentum.

115
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,280
No, I didn't.

116
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,119
You're like a green and inexperienced girl.

117
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,760
It's my turn now

118
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,359
to take you to see the world.

119
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,679
How

120
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,000
to experience?

121
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,679
Wait.

122
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
Are you ready?

123
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,320
Is this too hot?

124
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,479
It's not the first time we've come here.

125
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,400
Why are you shy?

126
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,200
Why do you suddenly think of swimming?

127
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on,

128
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,479
you paid a lot of money for the card.

129
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,440
Is it appropriate not to come?

130
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,159
I don't accept investment without return.

131
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Exercise can secrete dopamine

132
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
so as to keep you away
from the shadow of your ex.

133
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,159
Thinking about good things while exercising

134
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,359
will double your pleasure.

135
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Falling in love

136
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,039
is like doing a project.

137
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,840
Only by reading a large amount of data

138
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,679
can we find reliable projects.

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,400
Only when you've seen more diverse

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,320
and younger handsome men,

141
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
you won't

142
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
be dazed

143
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,239
by Poker Face.

144
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,080
Let's go.

145
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Have you heard a word?

146
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,000
You're facing a dark forest.

147
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,239
The person you like

148
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:54,520
has been stared at by countless eyes.

149
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,799
And they work harder than you think.

150
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,960
According to the principle of natural selection,

151
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,960
if you don't work hard,

152
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,919
you will be eliminated.

153
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
I think what you said

154
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
is like the employee mobilization meeting

155
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,400
of our company.

156
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,080
Come on.

157
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,679
We won't be so unlucky to meet Poker Face,

158
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,880
will we?

159
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,679
Come on.

160
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,960
I saw his itinerary when I came out.

161
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,880
He has an important meeting in the evening.

162
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,760
He can't be here.

163
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,000
That's fine.

164
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,280
The boy

165
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,679
with white goggles

166
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,679
who is 3.5 meters away from us is nice.

167
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,280
He suits you.

168
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,280
Come on!

169
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,239
I'm not interested.

170
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,880
This,

171
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,159
this one.

172
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,440
The one

173
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,359
coming out of the water

174
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,599
is the best.

175
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,599
Look, he's so handsome.

176
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,119
He's so handsome.

177
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,039
It's him. Go.

178
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Mr. Mo.

179
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,479
Why are you here?

180
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,080
You should ask Director Xu about this.

181
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,799
Come to talk about work again?

182
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,799
I don't understand what you mean.

183
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,599
Only you can swim here,

184
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,320
can't we?

185
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,000
I remember you can't swim, can you?

186
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm here to teach her.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,479
Come on.

188
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's go.

189
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,760
Why is he sitting down?

190
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,359
I thought he was leaving.

191
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,559
I want to go first.

192
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,119
I'm uncomfortable with him here.

193
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,799
It's expensive to come once.

194
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,239
I swim one more circle. Wait for me.

195
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,440
I can't swim.

196
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,239
Beauty,

197
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,239
why don't you go down?

198
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,320
I can't swim.

199
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,760
You are so thin.

200
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,200
You should rarely exercise.

201
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,479
Are you coming to play with your friends?

202
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,559
Do you often exercise?

203
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,640
Xu Qingyou,

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,760
come here.

205
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,440
I have to go.

206
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,919
Mr. Mo, what's wrong?

207
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,080
What else can I do?

208
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,000
After the Lyuluo incident,

209
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,799
has the Daily Active User of Lemi app

210
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,559
been affected?

211
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,159
Yes,

212
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,239
but it is a positive effect.

213
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,520
Increase instead of decrease.

214
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,679
It has increased to 140 to 150.

215
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,239
What about Monthly Active User?

216
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,440
Do you want to talk about work now?

217
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,520
My time counts.

218
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,640
Right here.

219
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,479
Didn't you say this?

220
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,359
Go on.

221
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,599
What is the Monthly Active User?

222
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,320
Mr. Mo,

223
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,880
I remember

224
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,039
the detailed data

225
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,200
has been written in the weekly report.

226
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,359
You can go back and see.

227
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,599
Is it more important to strike up a conversation
with a handsome guy

228
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,559
than to report to Party A?

229
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,679
Are they the same?

230
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,280
What's the meaning of writing a weekly report

231
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,280
if I have to report work during off-hours?

232
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,960
Xu Qingyou,

233
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
why are you here?

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,719
We have to go.

235
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,840
We have something else to do.

236
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,679
Mr. Mo,

237
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,400
I have something else.

238
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,039
I'll go first.

239
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,239
What are you two talking about just now?

240
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,239
He suddenly asked me to report work.

241
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,719
Why can I

242
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,799
meet Poker Face everywhere?

243
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,320
Doomed love definitely exists between you two.

244
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,200
If it weren't for you, I couldn't come here.

245
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,159
Doomed love can also become a good marriage.

246
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Don't talk nonsense.

247
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,960
I want to release my heart now.

248
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,799
I can't rush into a relationship.

249
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,359
Just follow your heart.

250
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,599
How about moving?

251
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,119
Moving is not a good choice.

252
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,719
Face the reality.

253
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,000
I gotta go.

254
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,359
Fighting!

255
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,679
Thank you.

256
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,200
You're welcome.

257
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,679
Please take care.

258
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,200
Bye bye.

259
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,640
Fang Qi,

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,599
you're back.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
What are you doing?

262
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,239
Look what's different at home.

263
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,479
New flowers?

264
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:03,960
Yeah.

265
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,719
Don't look so far away.

266
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,200
Look at the near one first.

267
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,400
New slippers?

268
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,200
I was just about to buy slippers.

269
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,239
Good job.

270
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:21,640
What?

271
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,200
The pink ones are yours.

272
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,080
Who wants to wear pink ones?

273
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,400
Pink is okay.

274
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,599
At least it's a couple with you.

275
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,159
I want the blue one, too.

276
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,479
OK.

277
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,679
All the blue ones belong to you 
and I'll use the pink ones.

278
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,080
Anyway, they're all in pairs.

279
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,119
What can I do for you?

280
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,719
I plan to give you this gift

281
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,560
when we get married.

282
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,119
We're done.

283
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,560
FX0725

284
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,079
is the abbreviation of our last name

285
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,439
and our anniversary.

286
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:31,880
I know

287
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,199
there are some problems between us.

288
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,199
But I believe it can be solved.

289
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:40,439
There is no need to waste time looking for others.

290
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,760
Once the hearts are no longer together,

291
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,079
it doesn't make any sense to force each other.

292
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,839
That's just a waste of time.

293
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,040
Which couple in the world

294
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,199
does not understand and tolerate each other

295
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,119
in conflicts and quarrels?

296
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,520
Why can't we be like this?

297
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,599
Because our error is not just one problem.

298
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,160
Our values are different.

299
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,640
Different values?

300
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,599
Who is influencing you anyway?

301
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,520
Myself.

302
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,280
No one can change me.

303
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,640
Neither can you.

304
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,640
I don't want it!

305
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,280
I don't want!

306
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,719
Why did Lawyer Fan force others?

307
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:25,760
Mr. Mo,

308
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,040
are you taking care of our personal affairs?

309
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
It's working time now.

310
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,880
There is no personal affairs.

311
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,520
Lawyer Fan,

312
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,160
as Shangger's legal counsel,

313
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,839
you have the responsibility
to pay attention to your words and deeds

314
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,040
so as not to affect Shangger's reputation.

315
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,479
You can change the car if you don't like it.

316
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,079
But our ten-year relationship

317
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,719
cannot be shaken so easily.

318
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,880
Youyou,

319
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,479
I'll make you understand

320
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,640
only the two of us can make a good couple.

321
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:13,760
Mr. Mo,

322
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,520
thank you for helping me out.

323
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,959
But I'll take care of my own affairs.

324
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,040
That's your way?

325
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,359
Don't bother you.

326
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,479
Fine.

327
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,400
Is it delicious?

328
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,920
Here.

329
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:52,959
Where's mine?

330
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,119
I forgot you were at home.

331
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,359
You're back.

332
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,640
What are you doing here?

333
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,199
I'm waiting for you.

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,439
Come here.

335
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,000
I stewed the fish soup.

336
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,520
Good job.

337
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,400
Wash your hands first.

338
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,479
I'll fill a bowl for you.

339
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,359
OK.

340
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,959
Why is this dress here?

341
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,000
Xu Wei,

342
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,239
what's going on here?

343
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,560
I, I just painted and ignored it.

344
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,000
Do you know how expensive it is?

345
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:05,760
Come here!

346
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,520
No.

347
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,599
I don't know.

348
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,079
Don't you know?

349
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:08,760
I'll buy you a new one.

350
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,800
What?

351
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,319
I'll buy one for you.

352
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,880
Come on!

353
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,760
Is this the picture you just painted?

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,239
Don't touch my clothes.

355
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,479
Or I'll kick you out.

356
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,160
Clean it up.

357
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,520
Draw my face smaller.

358
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,479
Oh, my God.

359
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,280
What's wrong with your eyes?

360
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,199
Are you sick?

361
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,439
Yeah,

362
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,479
I get lovesickness.

363
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:50,800
Thank you.

364
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,479
Please enjoy your meal.

365
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,680
Why do you use one-off chopsticks?

366
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,920
It's not environmentally friendly.

367
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,040
Do you know?

368
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,000
As an environmentalist,

369
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,079
although I'm rich enough,

370
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,880
I usually wear artificial fur.

371
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,119
I have a fetish about cleanliness.

372
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,000
Lingze also has a fetish about cleanliness.

373
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,040
You are the same as your boss.

374
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,920
He was so cold to me.

375
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,520
What kind of man is he?

376
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,760
There are only two reasons

377
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,000
why a man doesn't like you.

378
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,160
First,

379
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,880
he doesn't like women.

380
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,520
Second,

381
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,520
he likes other women.

382
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,119
Definitely not the first possibility.

383
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,839
Then it's the second one.

384
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:39,839
No, no, no.

385
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,560
If he doesn't like me,

386
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,719
I hope he likes men.

387
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,000
That's impossible.

388
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm with him 24 hours a day.

389
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,239
If he likes someone,

390
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,319
I must know.

391
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,719
Eat your food.

392
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,079
By the way,

393
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,479
it tastes really good.

394
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:14,800
Let me ask you,

395
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,760
what is the relationship

396
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,640
between Xu Qingyou and Lingze now?

397
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,959
Director Xu?

398
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,800
It is absolutely impossible for them to fall in love.

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,520
Really?

400
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,839
According to my observation,

401
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,599
every time they have a meeting,

402
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,239
they are both tit for tat.

403
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,520
They seem to be friendly to each other,

404
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,560
but in fact they hate each other.

405
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,359
Really?

406
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,959
Are you sure?

407
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:41,959
Are you sure you can see it accurately?

408
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,359
Can falling in love be like due diligence?

409
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,280
I can't be 100 percent sure.

410
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
Come on.

411
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,079
Since I hired you,

412
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,479
you have to give me 100% sure.

413
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,119
Why don't you try it for me?

414
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,319
How to try it?

415
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,040
Joint live broadcast?

416
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,160
The last joint live broadcast of Lyuluo and Eve

417
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,280
is amazing.

418
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,839
So I want to...

419
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,680
Strike while the iron is hot!

420
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,199
How about making another plan?

421
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,520
Let users choose the anchor

422
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,319
they want to see most.

423
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,199
Good idea.

424
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,439
Let the selected anchors be in the same frame.

425
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,199
The attention must be higher.

426
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,239
Great!

427
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:35,800
Qingyou,

428
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,040
I'm going to make the guiding rules.

429
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,319
Come on!

430
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,400
Director Xu, your flowers.

431
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,719
From whom?

432
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,239
Thank you.

433
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,810
(See you in Central Park at 7PM tonight.
From Barbecue Boy)

434
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:00,319
Dong Bao,

435
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,280
please throw away the flowers.

436
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,520
What a pity.

437
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,239
Then it's yours.

438
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,400
Hey, what's up?

439
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,319
Sister,

440
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm at home today.

441
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,880
Dad wanna talk to you tonight.

442
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,800
Talk to me?

443
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,319
He can't finish talking in three hours.

444
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:22,959
I'm not going.

445
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,239
He was really mad.

446
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,319
If you don't come, he won't let you go.

447
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,760
How bad can it be?

448
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,000
My dearest sister,

449
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,719
talk to him please.

450
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,280
Or he will be angry

451
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,640
at me alone.

452
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,479
It doesn't matter if I get beat up.

453
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,439
What if

454
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,560
anger affects his health?

455
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,199
All right.

456
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,910
(To Lin Siyu)

457
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,040
Who sent it?

458
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,560
It arrived before I did.

459
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,160
No sooner had I arrived than it was here.

460
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,319
It seems that

461
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,000
it was sent by Lemi.

462
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,439
Lemi?

463
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,130
(See you in Central Park at 7PM tonight.
From Barbecue Girl)

464
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,239
Barbecue girl?

465
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,079
Can Lemi have such boring people?

466
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:42,880
Is it boring?

467
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,640
What do you think of the barbecue girl?

468
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,800
Barbecue,

469
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:56,760
barbecue?

470
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,319
She must love barbecue.

471
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Do you think it could be Director Xu?

472
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,560
Do you know her very well?

473
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,199
Then I don't know the rest of Lemi.

474
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,199
Mr. Mo,

475
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,760
will you go?

476
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Are you concerned about it?

477
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,079
No.

478
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,479
I have to go.

479
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,560
Hello, dad.

480
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,719
Where's my mom?

481
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
Qingyou,

482
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,280
your temper is getting bigger and bigger now.

483
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,040
Don't say a word about moving.

484
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,719
Are you going to

485
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,520
never come back?

486
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
Of course not.

487
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,560
I always annoyed you at home,

488
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,880
so I moved away.

489
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,439
Besides,

490
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
it's also good for your health.

491
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:05,680
And

492
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,319
give you and my mother some privacy.

493
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,800
Am I willing to quarrel with you?

494
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,439
You've grown up.

495
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,439
I still need to worry about you.

496
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,160
You're getting married now.

497
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,800
Why are you so ignorant?

498
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,000
Master,

499
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,160
Youyou.

500
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,880
Come and sit down.

501
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,040
I'll do it.

502
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,040
Come on.

503
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,079
I called

504
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,199
Yunxi here.

505
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,040
I just hope

506
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
you two have a good talk

507
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,319
and solve all the misunderstandings.

508
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,199
This contradiction will naturally disappear.

509
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,040
Then you can get married.

510
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,079
Dad,

511
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
there is no misunderstanding.

512
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,479
We break up clearly.

513
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
You've been in love for ten years.

514
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,800
Is it so easy to break up?

515
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,560
That's better than
getting married and getting divorced.

516
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,959
What's your attitude?

517
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,800
Master, don't be angry.

518
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,439
Youyou may not mean that.

519
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,800
You are good for us.

520
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,000
Youyou knows that in her heart.

521
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:01,719
Look at Yunxi.

522
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,719
He is so sensible.

523
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
You're never satisfied.

524
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,880
You only look at the conditions.

525
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,400
Don't you mind if I like it or not?

526
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,680
It seems that

527
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,439
I will never be satisfied in my whole life.

528
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
You didn't listen to me

529
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,439
when you chose a major in a university.

530
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,680
You didn't listen to advice
when you found a job after graduation.

531
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,160
Haven't you learned your lesson?

532
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,560
Look at you.

533
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
In a small company,

534
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,319
what do you do every day?

535
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,800
Look at Li Yun, your Uncle Li's daughter.

536
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,760
She is now a professor at Qing University,

537
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,239
and her children is three years old.

538
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,479
How can I have a daughter

539
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,079
like you?

540
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,319
Dad,

541
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,199
as long as I don't listen to you,

542
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,079
you will be disappointed.

543
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,520
From young to elder,

544
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,880
you compare me to Li Yun.

545
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,959
And then?

546
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,400
She likes piano.

547
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,560
Then I can't like drawing.

548
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,280
She can be number one.

549
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,319
Then I can't be the second.

550
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
I chose my major in college

551
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,479
and looked for a job after graduation on purpose.

552
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,040
Because I don't want to compare with others.

553
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,000
I know that

554
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,400
you always

555
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,119
want me to marry your good student.

556
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,079
Isn't it because

557
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,239
you want to show off your son-in-law?

558
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,239
What are you talking about?
