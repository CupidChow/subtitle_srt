(Tang Xi)

4
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,559
Hello, Lingze.

5
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,080
I know you're still awake.

6
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,599
This trip is an overnight stay,

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,519
so remember to pack a change of clothes.

8
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,919
I am on the coffee beans.

9
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,400
I know your preference.

10
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,720
Okay, Ms. Tang.

11
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,400
I'll pack for him.

12
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,440
Miss Xu.

13
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,959
Could you please tell Lingze

14
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,319
that this business trip has been brought forward?

15
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:01,760
We're going to leave at this weekend.

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,760
Mr. Mo.

17
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,400
Why didn't I hear

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,759
that you are going on a business trip
with Ms. Tang?

19
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,160
I planned to

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,360
tell you tonight.

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,600
I promise

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,119
it is just a business trip.

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,080
Of course,

24
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,199
if you mind,

25
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,240
I won't go.

26
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,119
Go.

27
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,160
Why not?

28
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,399
Or I will be regarded as less sensible.

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,600
You must go.

30
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:28,559
Okay.

31
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,960
Here's to our sensible Director Xu.

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,800
Okay.

33
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,080
Here's to Mr. Mo for keeping his nose clean.

34
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,839
We are the warriors of the office.

35
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,880
We've gone through lots of difficulties
to get the position.

36
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,520
We can't quit!

37
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,720
Work gives me

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
the strength to face difficulties in life.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,839
Sorry.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,520
That's all right.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,360
Here.

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
Take it easy, lady.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,080
Thanks.

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,000
Thanks.

45
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,639
It's so hard for the young nowadays.

46
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,000
Working overtime so late.

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,479
Some are working hard for a better life,

48
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,200
while some achieve nothing.

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,640
Why do you hurt my soul in this beautiful morning?

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,519
Are we still brothers?

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,399
There are at least 1,000 months in a person's life.

52
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,559
Fang Qi persisted in her fight

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
for the first 120 months.

54
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,160
On the contrary,

55
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,119
for the past 240 months,

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,839
I have achieved nothing.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,799
Do you feel ill?

58
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:45,959
Fang Qi has overcome countless such breakdowns

59
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,480
to persevere until now.

60
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,760
What breakdowns?

61
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,920
What are you talking about?

62
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
Now that I have achieved nothing,

63
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,600
I am not good enough for Fang Qi
who is working hard.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,720
Where are you going?

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm going to make my name.

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,640
No way.

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,320
I want to take part in

68
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
this year's Pompidou Youth Art Exhibition,

69
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,559
so I'm looking for Mr. Peter Huang.

70
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,519
Mr. Huang is not here. Please come back.

71
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,600
Who hung this painting there?

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,559
The style is not matching!

73
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,119
It's horrible.

74
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,000
Anyone,

75
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,600
take this painting away!

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,600
Okay!

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,239
Mr. Huang.

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,000
Hello.

79
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,079
I'm Xu Wei.

80
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,239
We met before

81
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,239
at the Pompidou Masters of Modern Art Exhibition.

82
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,640
Who are you?

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
Get this painting out of here.

84
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,320
Okay.

85
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:57,880
Mr. Huang.

86
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,640
I admire you.

87
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,760
I have a collection of your curated works,

88
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,760
especially the one in 2017

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,079
called The Unity of Contradiction and Confrontation.

90
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,239
I graduated from

91
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts.

92
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,119
I know

93
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,839
that you are dedicated to

94
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,320
discovering young artists at home.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,279
Please have a look at my works.

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,880
I want to participate in

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
this year's Pompidou Youth Art Exhibition.

98
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,559
Young man,

99
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,600
why should I choose you?

100
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,480
I graduated with top honours.

101
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,320
I won three gold prizes in the school art exhibition.

102
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,239
I know

103
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,839
I'm not good enough now.

104
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,839
But I'll prove myself.

105
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:47,880
You said

106
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,440
art is for all ages,

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,119
for all who are willing to work hard.

108
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,720
There was a premise to this quote

109
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,279
that was cut out of the media.

110
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,440
The premise is "in the world of genius".

111
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,359
I can prove myself.

112
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,079
If I could change the painting

113
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,519
that you were not satisfied with,

114
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,799
could you recommend me to the exhibition?

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,320
Young man,

116
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,279
if you could do that,

117
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,320
I would recommend you to the exhibition.

118
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,200
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

119
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:46,760
Mo Lingze.

120
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,640
Hey, hold it!

121
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
I'm not here for you.

122
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Where's Wang Ji?

123
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,359
He's back to his home town.

124
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,040
Where?

125
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,079
Yuanji.

126
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,040
Darn, Wang Ji went home without saying a word.

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,000
What are you doing?

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,320
You've disappeared for two days.

129
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,200
I have some special things to do.

130
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,239
But I can't tell you now.

131
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,640
Did you hit someone on a skateboard
and have to escape?

132
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:32,640
It's impossible.

133
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,239
Tell me the truth.

134
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,719
I won't give in.

135
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,520
You won't?

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Give in or not?

137
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:47,640
It hurts.

138
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:50,640
What's wrong?

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,200
I haven't even made the effort yet.

140
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,559
You're trying to kill me.

141
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,640
I am now nominally your boyfriend,

142
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,200
but in reality I am your mobile sandbag.

143
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,520
Some even don't have the opportunity
to be my sandbag.

144
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,479
Anyway,

145
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,559
it's okay that you want to be disconnected.

146
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,039
But you come and tell me in advance.

147
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,880
Are you looking for this?

148
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,359
I think

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,559
I'm getting to know you better now,

150
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,719
so I want to be a better man.

151
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,359
That's why you disappear?

152
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:29,840
Just two days.

153
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,119
Two days later,

154
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,880
I'll tell you everything.

155
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,200
What's wrong with you?

156
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,640
By the way,

157
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,479
there's food in the fridge for the next two days.

158
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,719
Remember to eat it on time.

159
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,880
And you'll see me when you're done.

160
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,760
Who cares about your food?

161
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,760
How dare Xu Wei

162
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
play the disappearing game with me?

163
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
As his sister,

164
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,320
you should give me an explanation.

165
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:04,880
What?

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,640
What's wrong with you?

167
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,479
Forget your sister after having boyfriend?

168
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,119
I'm going to leave.

169
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,320
Let Mo Lingze play in mud with you.

170
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,000
No, no, no.

171
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,239
My...

172
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,200
Mo Lingze, he's away on business.

173
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,200
I was going

174
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,960
to do something nice for his birthday,

175
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,960
but all my plans went down the drain.

176
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,280
Right.

177
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,359
I heard from Wang Ji

178
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,320
that he went with Tang Xi.

179
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,320
So what?

180
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,599
It sounds like you are happy to hear that.

181
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,320
No.

182
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,239
I just want to ask you

183
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,640
are you worried?

184
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
No, I'm not.

185
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,280
We have made some rules.

186
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,479
First, no physical contact.

187
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,000
Second, no alone time.

188
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,880
Third, no recollections of the past.

189
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,119
How can you say you're not worried
under such strict rules?

190
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
I am busy!

191
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,200
I have a birthday present to prepare.

192
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,599
Are you kidding me?

193
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,599
You get him a cup for his birthday?
("Cup" and "tragedy" are homophone in Chinese.)

194
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,880
A cup means

195
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,840
we'll be together forever.
("Cup" and "forever" are homophone in Chinese.)

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.

197
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,320
In my opinion, don't prepare any gifts.

198
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,440
Just show up

199
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,840
in front of him

200
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,520
and tell him,

201
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,440
"Honey,

202
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm your gift,

203
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,559
enjoy."

204
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,679
I'm not interested in that.

205
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,919
It's just a birthday.

206
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,440
It's okay not to be together.

207
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,400
Why are you so unromantic?

208
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,760
Only you are romantic.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,640
So bad you are.

210
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,559
Hello?

211
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,640
I'm in the Maldives.

212
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,559
The sound?

213
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,840
It's the yacht.

214
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,479
I'm going to go diving.

215
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,200
I'd better hang up now.

216
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,039
Talk to you later.

217
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,119
Bye.

218
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
This is as far as I can take you,

219
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,919
you walk the rest of the way yourself.

220
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,080
Okay, thanks.

221
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,479
Go now.

222
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,719
The peanuts grow well this year.

223
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,359
Yeah.

224
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,280
(Yuanji Village)
The peanuts in my field grow well either.

225
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,840
There's a good harvest this year.

226
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,000
(Moments of Wang Ji)

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,640
(Moments of Wang Ji)
Yeah.

228
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,210
(Moments of Wang Ji)

229
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,479
Look.

230
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,039
Have a look.

231
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,880
This one's getting a nice tan, too.

232
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,000
Hello uncle.

233
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,280
Could you tell me

234
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,640
does Wang Ji live around here?

235
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,760
He's in that alley right there.

236
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,679
You can come in this way.

237
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,559
Okay. Thanks.

238
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,640
You're welcome.

239
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:55,960
Wang Ji.

240
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,719
Don't leave.

241
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,880
How could you do this?

242
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,760
Come here without a word.

243
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
I ran out of my fuel tank.

244
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,960
And my shoes are broken to find you.

245
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,280
Our contract was over.

246
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,359
Who told you that?

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,479
Last time...

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,640
I'm here

249
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,200
in the spirit of contract

250
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,080
to say goodbye to you.

251
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,400
Is this the attitude

252
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
you want to take towards your first party?

253
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:56,960
What do you want?

254
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,479
Help me.

255
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,799
In fact, I come to you

256
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,760
to invite you to start a business with me.

257
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,080
Our contract was over.

258
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,080
I want to sign a new contract with you.

259
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,880
No, thanks.

260
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,880
It's a precious opportunity.

261
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Are you sure you want to reject me?

262
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm good in Shangger.

263
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,039
Wang Ji.

264
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,679
To see you,

265
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,039
I've driven 547 miles

266
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
and walked for over three hours.

267
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,960
And my shoes were broken.

268
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,640
Now, you're going to reject me.

269
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,320
Your shoes are costly, right?

270
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,440
It's just a pair of shoes.

271
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:18,919
I'll throw it away when I get back.

272
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,039
Look at mine.

273
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,200
What do you mean, Wang Ji?

274
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,080
I don't care about these things.

275
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,520
We live in different worlds.

276
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Don't come to me again.

277
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
What do you mean?

278
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,479
Come back.

279
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,119
Living in different worlds is okay.

280
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,400
I don't care.

281
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,080
Lingze.

282
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,280
Chen Ziming's greatest taboo

283
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,960
is the relationship with his mother.

284
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,760
So, it's not easy to persuade him

285
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,039
to help us with the Hua Group event.

286
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,359
I'll try my best to support you later.

287
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:12,919
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

288
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,640
It's been a long time
since we've worked side by side like this.

289
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,599
The Flat White here still tastes the same.

290
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,000
I still remember...

291
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,159
Sorry, I need to answer this.

292
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,840
What's up? Somebody misses me?

293
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,479
Who misses my boyfriend?

294
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,520
I'll beat her.

295
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,520
How's your work?

296
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,280
Is everything going well?

297
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:34,840
Not bad.

298
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:36,880
I just feel a little bored

299
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,640
without Director Xu.

300
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,599
I just want to finish my work quickly,

301
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,159
and get back to stay with my girlfriend.

302
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,559
Since you're so eager to return,

303
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,840
work hard

304
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and finish early

305
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,559
so you can see your girlfriend.

306
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,000
When I get back,

307
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,799
I'll have dinner with my girl.

308
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,239
Bye.

309
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,799
Have calls with your girlfriend

310
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,880
during work hours.

311
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,160
Mr. Mo, you never did personal business
during work hours before.

312
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,719
Ms. Tang, you never

313
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,640
judged others' affairs before.

314
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:16,880
Mr. Chen.

315
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,199
Ms. Tang.

316
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,079
Long time no see.

317
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,079
You've changed a lot.

318
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,079
You're prettier.

319
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,560
This is

320
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
your...

321
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,160
This is Mr. Mo, Mo Lingze of Shangger Capital.

322
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,520
Mr. Chen.

323
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,119
Fengtang Capital and Shangger Capital are partners.

324
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,160
So, Ms. Tang and I

325
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,839
are partners, either.

326
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,680
Of course.

327
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,439
Let's walk and talk.

328
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,359
Please.

329
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,119
I've heard a lot about Mr. Mo.

330
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm expected to cooperate with you.

331
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,400
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

332
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,520
Shangger is expected to cooperate with you, either.

333
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,880
Right, Mr. Chen.

334
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,640
Excuse me.

335
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,319
I'm going to leave for a while.

336
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,439
My girlfriend is here.

337
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,400
You are here to check up on me?

338
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,199
You have an overactive imagination, Mr. Mo.

339
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,079
I'm just here on a company assignment

340
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,199
and happened to meet you.

341
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,520
That's quite a pity.

342
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,199
I was going to have dinner with Director Xu

343
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,760
when work was over.

344
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,439
I'd consider

345
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,839
having dinner with you

346
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,760
if I finished work early.

347
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:41,800
Okay.

348
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,359
Mr. Mo.

349
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,199
Mr. Chen has a tight schedule.

350
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
Let's get down to business first.

351
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,680
Okay.

352
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,119
Come back early.

353
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,119
Wait for me.

354
00:18:59,079 --> 00:18:59,560
Mr. Chen.

355
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,920
Miss Xu.

356
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,920
Kindly remind

357
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,479
surprises can easily turn into scares.

358
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:17,920
Mr. Mo.

359
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,359
Bell Company has nothing to do with Hua Group.

360
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,000
If Bell Company and Hua Group are really not related,

361
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,800
then why does Bell shift 20%

362
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,880
of its annual profits to Hua Group?

363
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,359
How do you know that?

364
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,280
Bell Company and Hua Group are
in fact a parent-subsidiary relationship.

365
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,079
They wax and wane simultaneously.

366
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,760
The reason why Ms. Hua

367
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,160
refused to sign off on the M&A

368
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,599
was she felt that Bell Company is your effort.

369
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,119
But Hua Group is her effort, either.

370
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,280
If you continue to do so,

371
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,560
sooner or later, Hua Group will
have to do a bankruptcy filing.

372
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,079
Mr. Chen.

373
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,280
If you can persuade Ms. Hua to sign,

374
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,719
Shangger

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,239
will be able to save both companies.

376
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,040
I believe

377
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,040
it's also what you expect.

378
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,439
I can help,

379
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,800
but you two have set me up for a trap today,

380
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,439
so shouldn't you apologize to me?

381
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,959
Mr. Chen.

382
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,239
At your disposal.

383
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,959
I've heard that Ms. Tang is good at fencing.

384
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,160
I'd like to take this opportunity

385
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,359
to have a good sword fight with you.

386
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,280
Mr. Chen.

387
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,239
How about having a sparring with me?

388
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,880
What?

389
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,599
Mr. Mo, are you trying to
take advantage of the situation

390
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,920
and take me down in swordplay as well?

391
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,479
Mr. Chen.

392
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,199
Don't mind him.

393
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:39,920
Come on.

394
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:41,800
Look.

395
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,319
Ms. Tang can't wait

396
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,439
to spar with me.

397
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,800
I can't wait to cooperate with you.

398
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:47,839
Okay.

399
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,479
Ms. Tang, I lost to you,

400
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,680
this time,

401
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,920
I must win.

402
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,160
Ms. Tang.

403
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,640
Please.

404
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,520
-Hello.
-Hello.

405
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,000
I've heard that customers can choose their own songs

406
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,400
for birthday party, right?

407
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,119
Yes.

408
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,800
You can tell us what you want to sing

409
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,760
and we'll arrange for the band to rehearse.

410
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,560
You will be able to sing live in the evening.

411
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,680
By the way,

412
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,959
could I rehearse with the band in advance?

413
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,000
Of course. This way, please.

414
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,079
Thanks.

415
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,199
Ms. Tang.

416
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,760
You're not sincere enough.

417
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,359
Solicit business for Mr. Mo.

418
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,920
You should make all your efforts.

419
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,640
Okay, as you wish.

420
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,239
Right.

421
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:54,719
Come on.

422
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,400
Tang Xi.

423
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:17,839
Ms. Tang.

424
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,160
Tang Xi.

425
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,680
What's wrong?

426
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,520
Where's your medicine?

427
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,800
I ask somebody for a favor.

428
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,199
Okay.

429
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,439
Tomorrow's meeting is rescheduled for the morning.

430
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,439
Remember to send me the plan in advance.

431
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Ms. Xu, hello.

432
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,959
Our band has waited for a long time.

433
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,239
Do you...

434
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,479
Just give me a minute, please.

436
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,199
It's an important person.

437
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,959
I understand.

438
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,479
Please wait for a while.

439
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,239
Sorry.

440
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,359
Thanks.

441
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,760
It's me who should say thanks.

442
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,199
Thank you for everything you did for Shangger.

443
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
You know what I did was not for Shangger,

444
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,359
it's for you.

445
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:12,119
I need thanks from you.

446
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,359
It's not from Mr. Mo.

447
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
It's from Mo Lingze.

448
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,760
Tang Xi.

449
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,800
You don't have to do this.

450
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,119
Do you remember

451
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,839
the winter of my first year in the business?

452
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,640
We went to meet a client together

453
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,000
and I had a sudden asthma attack.

454
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,359
You were the same back then as you are now.

455
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,160
It was you who took me to the hospital.

456
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,599
And then you stayed by my side

457
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,640
as you do now.

458
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,280
Take your medication with you.

459
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,520
Not every time you will have someone by your side.

460
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,479
Stay with me tonight,

461
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,280
can you?

462
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,719
Lingze.

463
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,119
Excuse me, Ms. Xu.

464
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,319
It's very late now.

465
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,280
Do we have to wait any longer?

466
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,359
Just a moment, please.

467
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,719
He will definitely come.

468
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,479
Then how should we deal with the cost?

469
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,119
About the cost,

470
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,640
I'll pay by the hour.

471
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,400
Thanks.

472
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,319
I'm so sorry.

473
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,400
Please wait for a while.

474
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,560
Thank you very much.

475
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,520
No problem.

476
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,079
Qingyou.

477
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,119
Sorry.

478
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,079
I'm late.

479
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:09,719
You must be getting impatient.

480
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,000
No, I'm not.

481
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,400
I was just about to leave.

482
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,359
Just now Tang Xi was admitted to hospital
with an asthma attack.

483
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,719
I left in a hurry

484
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,680
and didn't check my phone.

485
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,560
I came to see you as soon as I saw your message.

486
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,319
Will she be okay in the hospital alone?

487
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,719
She has someone to accompany her.

488
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,760
Don't worry.

489
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,239
Instead, it was my girl,

490
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,400
who was alone and sulking.

491
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,280
I must hurry back to be with her.

492
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,640
It's not

493
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,280
too late for you to come.

494
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,239
A present for you.

495
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:46,640
Come on.

496
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,599
Do I make a progress?

497
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,479
My little fairy

498
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,599
must sing flawlessly!

499
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,319
Thank you.

500
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,319
Happy birthday, Lingze.

501
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,079
Happy birthday to you.

502
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,319
Happy birthday to you.

503
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,000
Happy birthday to you.

504
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,560
Happy birthday to you.

505
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,400
Qingyou.

506
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,760
I feel tired.

507
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,400
I want to go back and have a rest.

508
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,280
What's the matter?

509
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:04,640
Leave me alone.

510
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:57,760
Miss Xu.

511
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Kindly remind

512
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,920
surprises can easily turn into scares.

513
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,119
Tomorrow is your birthday.

514
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,199
What kind of gift do you want?

515
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,800
I want you and Mum

516
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,319
to come to my piano competition tomorrow.

00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,359
Hello.

518
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,359
Qingyou.

519
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,839
Where are you?

520
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm at your door.

521
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,439
Mr. Zhai called me

522
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,839
and said there's a meeting tomorrow.

523
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,040
So, I have to go.

524
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,319
Okay.

525
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:09,760
Where are you?

526
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,479
I'll take you back.

527
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,239
No, thanks.

528
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm already in a taxi.

529
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,439
Okay.

530
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,719
Then wait for me to complete the current business.

531
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,719
I will definitely give you an explanation

532
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
when I return tomorrow.
