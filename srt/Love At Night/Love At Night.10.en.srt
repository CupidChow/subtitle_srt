=Episode 10=

3
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,960
Let's go.

4
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,750
This is so cute!

5
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,320
Do you like it?

6
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,320
You can make it

7
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,750
on site.

8
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,160
You can have 30% off if you're a couple.

9
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,720
Well?

10
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,630
Let's make one.

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,470
Okay.

12
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,030
If I go on business trips in the future,

13
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,190
it can keep you company.

14
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,830
Then you won't be afraid.

15
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,390
Then I'd rather not.

16
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,190
I want you to be by my side

17
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,520
all the time.

18
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,030
I'll take it.

19
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,080
Miss, your stuff!

20
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,720
Well? Does it fit me?

21
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,080
It's alright.

22
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,390
You have said it was too big.

23
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,880
Look.

24
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,390
It isn't big at all.
It looks good.

25
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,360
But this might...

26
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,270
Youyou, you're back.

27
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,470
Look.

28
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,110
I'm back.

29
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,270
How's my dress?

30
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,550
Doesn't this fit me?

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,320
It looks nice.

32
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,440
But this isn't your usual style.

33
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,110
I will wear this on the wedding.

34
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,670
Whose wedding?

35
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,000
Yours!

36
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,960
I told your mom

37
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,630
that you two

38
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,000
are busy with your work

39
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,720
and haven't even set the date yet.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,750
But she had to buy it.

41
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,880
I bought it because
I thought it fitted me rather well.

42
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Dad...

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,470
The wedding will be held anyway.

44
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,030
Mom.

45
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,960
You're so impatient.

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,520
Sit.

47
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,550
There won't be a wedding.

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
I broke up with Fan Yunxi.

49
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,720
What? Did you two get into a fight?

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,230
No.

51
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,200
We just broke up.

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,350
Xu Qingyou,

53
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,000
marriage is no joke.

54
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,830
How could you just say that
you're not getting married?

55
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,670
This is exactly why

56
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,510
I need to think this through.

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,760
In my mind,

58
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Yunxi is already my son-in-law.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,670
Youyou, have you thought it through?

60
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,480
Yes.

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,350
If you really can't accept it,

62
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,350
I can do nothing.

63
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,320
You...

64
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,110
What?

65
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,270
You don't even know

66
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,720
why she broke up.

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,950
What's wrong with you?

68
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,640
tomorrow,

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,350
tomorrow,

70
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,070
go find Yunxi to talk it over.

71
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
What happened?

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,920
How could you stop your engagement?

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,950
We have talked already.

74
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,230
This is the result.

75
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,550
I know what I want.

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,480
Excellent.

77
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,110
Sis,

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,350
I support you.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,480
You...

80
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,600
You have to follow your own heart.

81
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,070
What are you doing here?

82
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,600
Why are you drunk in the middle of the day?

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
Look at you now.

84
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,230
Xu Qingyou, I'm telling you,

85
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
I don't agree with you to break up.

86
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,920
Find Yunxi tomorrow

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,880
and have a good chat.

88
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,440
Or else don't come home.

89
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,920
What are you doing?

90
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,320
Sis,

91
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
where are you going?

92
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,880
Look at you.

93
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,200
Dad,

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,230
let my sister handle her things.

95
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,230
This is none of your concern.

96
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,230
Enough.

97
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,440
Go look after your sister.

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Go, go.

99
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,790
Look at him.

100
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,110
Enough. Couldn't you say less?

101
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,440
Don't...

102
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,160
Stop it.

103
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,510
Enough.

104
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,040
He's drunk in the day.

105
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,160
Sis.

106
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,270
Careful.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,790
Watch out.

108
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,320
I want to say this to you in person.

109
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,070
I support you.

110
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,510
My mission in life

111
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,480
is to love,

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,160
protect and support you.

113
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,480
Alright, come here.

114
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,040
Come.

115
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,270
It's alright.

116
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,440
Do you have something on your mind?

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,640
Why did you drink so much?

118
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,950
It's nothing.

119
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,920
What could happen to me?

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,510
Really？

121
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,760
If you do have something
on your mind,

122
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,880
don't hold it in.

123
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,350
You can tell me.

124
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,440
If you don't want to tell me,

125
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,350
go talk to Fang Qi.

126
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,390
Fang Qi.

127
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,200
She wouldn't talk to me.

128
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,440
I made her angry.

129
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,510
She doesn't even talk to me now.

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,040
She's always like that.

131
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,510
Didn't you always make her angry?

132
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,000
It's different this time.

133
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,720
Before I came back here,

134
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,920
I promised myself

135
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,270
before her thirtieth birthday,

136
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,390
I would make her happy

137
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,390
and not bring any inconvenience to her.

138
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,000
Looks like Fang Qi's thirtieth birthday

139
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,320
is quite important to you.

140
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,110
I remember she told me last time...

141
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,200
Let's go.

142
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,920
I'll take you home.

143
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,510
No, no.

144
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,600
Alright, Xu Wei.

145
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,670
I can't go back.

146
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,880
You go.

147
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:56,920
Go.

148
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,200
- Go back.  - Where are you going?

149
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,880
I have my own place to go to.
Don't worry.

150
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,350
Come on.

151
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,830
Let's go.

152
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,350
Then,

153
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,320
then,

154
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,230
don't worry about

155
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,270
mom and dad.

156
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,160
I won't say anything.

157
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,110
- Don't worry.  - Okay.

158
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,000
I know.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,790
Be careful.

160
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,320
Come back soon.

161
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Watch your step.

162
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,550
Mr. Fan,

163
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,110
the package you told me to
send to Qingyou

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,070
was returned.

165
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,840
Okay.

166
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,840
It's so hard when girls throw a fit.

167
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,520
Qingyou is just having a tiff.

168
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,550
Just say something nice.

169
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't have time for this.
I'm too busy with work.

170
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,670
She'll think it through.

171
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,230
Let her calm down first.

172
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,350
Then about her,

173
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,760
do you need me to do anything else?

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,910
We're grown-ups.

175
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,840
Weighing the pros and cons

176
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,320
and making the best choice

177
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,280
are basics.

178
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,030
She'll understand.

179
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,670
If it wasn't for your mom's call
last night,

180
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,790
I wouldn't even know
you broke up with him.

181
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,840
Shouldn't

182
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,470
you have given me a heads up?

183
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,590
I didn't keep it from you on purpose.

184
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,550
Besides,

185
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,520
didn't you tell me

186
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,000
to think it through on what I want?

187
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,550
Then did you think it through?

188
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,790
Well, no actually.

189
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,910
But I know what I don't want.

190
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,640
At least you are making progress.

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,670
I'm telling you that

192
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,670
breaking up should be swift.

193
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,710
If this time

194
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,760
you have been determined
to break up with him...

195
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,590
Thank you.

196
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,440
What do you want to order?

197
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,230
Here's the amended contract.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,640
Put it here.

199
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,030
How's the pop-up shop project?

200
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,200
The project is going well.

201
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,470
We will have a meeting in two days.

202
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,710
I'll finish the proposal
as soon as possible.

203
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,230
Let Wang Ji handle the proposal.

204
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,470
You can get off early.

205
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,280
Take a rest

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,030
and meet some friends.

207
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,150
Meet friends?

208
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,280
Are you giving me a holiday?

209
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,030
To keep my friend company?

210
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,790
If you don't have any friend to meet,

211
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,640
I'm happy to let you work overtime.

212
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,910
No, no.

213
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,350
I have a lot of friends.

214
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,840
Thanks, boss. See you later!

215
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,470
Are you really planning on moving out?

216
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,400
Don't you want to explain to your dad?

217
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,470
What's the point in explaining?

218
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,440
He's not going to listen anyway.

219
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,640
Or else I wouldn't be homeless.

220
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,030
If it wasn't for your breakup

221
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,440
and losing father's love,

222
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,960
I wouldn't be here with you.

223
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,520
I have so much to do.

224
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,200
The only person who cares for me now

225
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,470
is my best friend.

226
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,320
You.

227
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,760
You two were together for ten years.

228
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,000
You must be suffering.

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
I went through it too.

230
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,550
I understand.

231
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,230
Right.

232
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,710
Do you remember what you told me

233
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,440
when you got a divorce?

234
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,400
What did I say?

235
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,470
You told me that you would live happily

236
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,440
and would never celebrate
your thirtieth birthday alone.

237
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,030
You still remember that?

238
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,790
No, not me. It's Xu Wei.

239
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,910
I suspect that he came back in a rush

240
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,110
to celebrate your birthday.

241
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,520
It's just a divorce.

242
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,670
It's nothing to me.

243
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,110
Tomorrow I'll find

244
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,710
someone better than him
to celebrate the birthday with me.

245
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,760
But if you don't have anyone with you next year,

246
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,590
remember to call me.

247
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,520
Don't go through it alone.

248
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,150
We're talking about you.

249
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,760
Why are you changing the subject?

250
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,470
I thought that breaking up

251
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,840
would make my whole life fall apart.

252
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,790
But look, the sun continues to rise.

253
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,910
Also, today is a nice day.

254
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,760
Stop it.

255
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,790
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,030
I understand now.

257
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,550
Women shouldn't put men

258
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,670
as their first priority.

259
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,110
At this moment, I just want to

260
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
work hard.

261
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,000
It's okay to work hard

262
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,400
but if you don't want to be in a relationship,

263
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,790
it's kind of impossible.

264
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,760
Look.

265
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,550
You just broke off with Fan Yunxi

266
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,670
but there's already someone
waiting in the wings.

267
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,280
Who?

268
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,280
Do you think I am so free

269
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,000
that I can come here to talk to you?

270
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,790
It is because Mr. Mo gave me a day off.

271
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,400
I have to say it's hard to refuse

272
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,110
that

273
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,550
even for me.

274
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,790
Mr. Mo gave you a day off?

275
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,280
That's impossible.

276
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,030
He might be cold on the outside

277
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,350
but he's concerned about you.

278
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,590
Sis,

279
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,640
mom and dad found out that I gave up MFA.

280
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,790
Please come back

281
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,150
or I'm going to die.

282
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,710
Oh no.

283
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,280
Xu Wei's in trouble too.

284
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,790
I thought he could help me out.

285
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,280
Turns out he couldn't even save himself.

286
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,960
One of us broke the engagement

287
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,790
and the other quit school.

288
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,550
If I go back now,
it would only make things worse.

289
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,150
As my parent's favorite friend,

290
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,790
can you help me out?

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,030
What on earth did I do to meet you two?

292
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm begging you.

293
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,710
Or else I'm so dead.

294
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,400
Fine.

295
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,400
Stay at my place tonight.

296
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,110
I'll go and rescue Xu Wei.

297
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,760
Then bring some food for you
to eat at night.

298
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,550
Love you.

299
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,880
What on earth did I do

300
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,350
to have children like you two?

301
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,110
Dad.

302
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,710
I.

303
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,960
-Stand right there. - Dad!

304
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,030
Uncle, uncle.

305
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,840
Calm down.

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
If your blood pressure rises,
you need take your medicine.

307
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,280
It's not worth it.

308
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,110
Not worth it.

309
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,200
Why are you...

310
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,760
Xu Wei, what's the matter with you?

311
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,910
It's such a great school

312
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,790
and you have such great grades.

313
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,790
Why did you suddenly quit

314
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,470
and come back to teach kids
how to draw bunnies?

315
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,880
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

316
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
Your dad couldn't catch you

317
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,640
but you won't get away from my spiral kick.

318
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,230
I'm telling you,

319
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:31,960
get over here.

320
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,400
Wait, wait.

321
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,520
Uncle, don't worry.

322
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,150
I won't show mercy.

323
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,840
You rest. I don't want to injure you
by mistake.

324
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
Fang Qi.

325
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,760
Not worth it. Not worth it.

326
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,640
Right.

327
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,230
There's something

328
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,200
I want to ask you.

329
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,080
We can teach him a lesson later.

330
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,030
Alright.

331
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,710
Ask away.

332
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,710
Sit, sit.

333
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,150
Fang Qi,

334
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,880
did you know Youyou broke up?

335
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,880
Why didn't you persuade her not to?

336
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,400
I haven't seen her for days.

337
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,550
Is she at your place?

338
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
No, no.

339
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,880
Of course I wouldn't let her stay
after what happened.

340
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,760
Look.

341
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,640
You two used to trick me.

342
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,520
You're quite clever

343
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,400
but why at critical moments

344
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,590
you would make the same mistakes
with her?

345
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,080
Dad, we're not going to get in
your hair now.

346
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,640
We're leaving.

347
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,710
See you next time!

348
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,110
Bye!

349
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,110
Come back here.

350
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,030
You scared me.

351
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,710
Ouch.

352
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,200
Couldn't you be gentle?

353
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,910
Come here. Or I'll give you a good punch.

354
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,910
I'm already in this position.

355
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,710
Can't you be more gentle?

356
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,110
Go away!

357
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,110
Just because I made a joke about
my thirtieth birthday,

358
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,470
you gave up your MFA?

359
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,550
I'm amazed.

360
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,550
How did you find out?

361
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,030
None of your business.

362
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,590
Are you still a child?

363
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,200
You're twenty years old.

364
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
What a valuable opportunity!

365
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If I were your parent,

366
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,320
I would want to kill you too.

367
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,150
Then why did you save me?

368
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,910
I didn't mean to.

369
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,000
I was afraid that your sister would
make things worse

370
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,910
if she came.

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,030
Didn't she make my parents angry too?

372
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,200
Why isn't she immature to you?

373
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,470
You little brat.

374
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,710
How could you compare yourself
with your sister?

375
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,710
Don't call me brat.

376
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,550
I have already grown up.

377
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,840
Stand up.

378
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I'm taller than you.

379
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
Even you're taller,

380
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,590
I'm still your sister.

381
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,230
If only you weren't.

382
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,280
Is this your apology?

383
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,350
What apology?

384
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,800
If you apologize to your parents properly,

385
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,520
I could consider patching up things with you.

386
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,070
Then can we still

387
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,230
hang out everyday?

388
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
You've graduated from university.

389
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
Why is having fun always on your mind?

390
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,920
Why can't you think about work?

391
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,880
I came back

392
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,310
for inspiration.

393
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,590
If I couldn't find inspiration,

394
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,640
how could I create a good work?

395
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,160
I don't know anything
about inspirations

396
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,070
but I only know that whether

397
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,310
I make it or not in the art circle

398
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,880
is up to you.

399
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:53,830
Fine.

400
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,190
I can definitely make it work.

401
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,110
You wait and see.

402
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,350
Nice.

403
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,310
Give me one.

404
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,230
You are great.

405
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,310
Let me try.

406
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,430
Okay.

407
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,430
We'll end here today.

408
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,310
Go get ready.

409
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,950
Dong Bao,

410
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,070
did you finish the data collection?

411
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes.

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,710
I'll send it to you immediately.

413
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,640
Qingyou, something came up.

414
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,950
Lyuluo's original song

415
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,160
was accused of copying Eve's.

416
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
It's already on Weibo's hot search.

417
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,110
Don't panic.

418
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,680
Let's verify everything first.

419
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,400
If it's fake, then we have to
take legal action.

420
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,230
If it's true,

421
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,400
we need to prepare a statement
to apologize.

422
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,710
Let me go find Lyuluo.

423
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,430
Okay.

424
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,520
Lyuluo, I'm Xu Qingyou.

425
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,640
Are you home?

426
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,310
Are you home?

427
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,430
Lyuluo, I'm Xu Qingyou.

428
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,070
Please open your door.

429
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,280
Finally.

430
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,190
I want to talk to you about that song.

431
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,110
I didn't plagiarize
and I don't want to explain.

432
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,280
Don't bother me.

433
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,680
But you can't just reject communication.

434
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,830
Please open up.

435
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,280
Let us discuss.

436
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,760
Lyuluo.

437
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,590
Lemi's anchor was accused of copying.

438
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,470
What's your take on this?

439
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,310
The important thing about investments
is to avoid risks.

440
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,400
No one can guarantee

441
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,880
if this matter will be handled properly.

442
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,680
We can't make a mistake
that penny wise and pound foolish

443
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,430
just because we worked together well.

444
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,800
Shangge's investment in Lemi...

445
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,680
I can guarantee.

446
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,400
How we handle this

447
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,560
is important to Lemi

448
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,070
and us.

449
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,190
As Lemi's investor,

450
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,880
how we protect them

451
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,310
and stand by them

452
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,560
are being watched by other firms.

453
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,880
Go on.

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,190
I would do everything in my power

455
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,000
to not let this

456
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,520
affect Lemi's value.

457
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,830
I am willing

458
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,590
to use my position as vice president
to guarantee.

459
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,280
Mr. Mo.

460
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,040
Mr. Luo.

461
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,800
Lemi is my project.

462
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,230
I believe in Lemi

463
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
so I hope Mr. Luo

464
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,230
will believe in my decision and ability.

465
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,520
Does this count as copying?

466
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,070
Technically, it doesn't.

467
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,830
The nature of popular music

468
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,470
is to find the music commonalities
of the public.

469
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,280
It's normal that some are similar.

470
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,350
It means that they sound so similar

471
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,470
that it's easily misunderstood
by the public.

472
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
You can take it that way.

473
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,350
But I don't think it's plagiarism.

474
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,230
We just need to explain
the technicalities.

475
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,640
People would understand.

476
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,280
But copyrights has always been

477
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,190
a difficult problem.

478
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,590
The public doesn't understand
how it works.

479
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
It's hard for professionals to explain.

480
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,560
Would netizens believe us?

481
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,880
The talk on the internet is
very irrational at the moment.

482
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,640
The whole conversation would take a different
direction with the slightest change.

483
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,070
That would be bad.

484
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,280
True that the conversation
changes in the blink of an eye.

485
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,400
I suggest

486
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,470
you discuss with the singer.

487
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,590
Then, we can move onto PR.

488
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,000
Alright. Let me come back first.

489
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,190
Thanks.

490
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,760
Alright.

491
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,400
Goodbye.

492
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,000
(Fang Qi)
Mr. Luo is very concerned about this.

493
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,040
He wants to reevaluate
the investment in Lemi.

494
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,070
Mr.Mo is holding up by himself

495
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,470
and putting his job on the line.

496
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,560
You have to put in all your effort.

497
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,160
Hello, Mr. Zhai?

498
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,190
Lyuluo still isn't willing to cooperate.

499
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,430
I said everything I could.

500
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,880
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

501
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,430
I'm continuing our project.

502
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,230
What project?

503
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,560
With this scandal, the presell
isn't going to work.

504
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,880
About this,

505
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,350
you have to give me
a satisfactory response.

506
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,160
Hello, Mr. Wang?

507
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,400
Please don't worry.

508
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,280
It is certain that we will protect
the interest of the brand.

509
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,760
You don't even have your anchor.

510
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,000
How could you protect our interest?

511
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,110
If you don't solve this,

512
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,880
we will cut all your supplies.

513
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,470
Hello?

514
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,190
Something happened.

515
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,400
Lyuluo's peripheral products

516
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,590
can hold for the moment.

517
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,350
I'm so sorry. Something happened.

518
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,710
What? Put a stop to it?

519
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,520
How could you put a stop to it
just like that?

520
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,230
Is this how you do business?

521
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,680
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,070
Why are you still putting on a strong face
even when you feel ill?

523
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,680
None of your business.

524
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,430
Here.

525
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,680
Thank you.

526
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
You're in so much stomach pain but you still
want to do everything by yourself.

527
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,950
Is your solution to torture yourself?

528
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,950
Mr. Mo, please tell me.

529
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,680
What should I do?

530
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,350
At least when you're handling things,

531
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,520
you should eat on time.

532
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,070
The comments on the Internet
are getting worse.

533
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,830
I can't think of any solution.

534
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,070
I feel really worried.

535
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
I should go back to the company.

536
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,800
I still have to deal with a lot of things.

537
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,190
Also, for the anchor,

538
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,680
we need to find a replacement
as soon as possible.

539
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
We can solve these problems tomorrow.

540
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,880
I'll take you home to rest.

541
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,560
Stand right here.

542
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,160
Come here.

543
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,350
Dad.

544
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,880
I looked up on the Internet.

545
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,880
Your school

546
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,070
gave recommendation letters

547
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,470
to five students.

548
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,680
Do you know what this means?

549
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,070
If you give up on your MFA

550
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,520
it's like giving up a short cut.

551
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,800
In the future,

552
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,710
even if you could get to the top

553
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,880
of the hierarchy,

554
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,280
you still have to take the long road.

555
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,040
Dad.

556
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,830
Why do you say this again?

557
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
Is having a MFA

558
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,950
the only correct way?

559
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,160
Does it make you a better person

560
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,640
or have longevity?

561
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,760
Besides,

562
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,230
it's not that I couldn't get in.

563
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
I just don't want to go.

564
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,430
I'm telling you.

565
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,950
You're going even if you don't want to.

566
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,310
I don't care what the reason is.

567
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,350
You have to go and apply.

568
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,070
You have to do your Master's.

569
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,760
Dad.

570
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,110
Do you really think
you're at a supermarket?

571
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,160
That you can leave whenever you want?

572
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,680
I have both abilities and competence.

573
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,430
I don't need that diploma.

574
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,040
You don't need that diploma?

575
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,560
I'm telling you,
you're going to regret this.

576
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
I never should have come back.

577
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,110
Fine.

578
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,110
Leave.

579
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,640
Fine.

580
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,190
I can make a living

581
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,160
by myself.

582
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,040
I just came back to tell you

583
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,160
that the decision was not made

584
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,400
impulsively.

585
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,400
I have my own plan.

586
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,880
I came back to create better artwork.

587
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,470
I'm leaving.

588
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,680
Fine, go.

589
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Go if you can.

590
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm leaving.

591
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,070
If you leave,

592
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,190
don't ever come back.

593
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,760
This kid makes me so angry.

594
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,000
Dayan,

595
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,520
please don't lock the door tonight.

596
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,040
I'm staying at the studio.

597
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,800
It seems Lemi made no progress.

598
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,110
We're waiting for the best moment
to counterattack.

599
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,280
Excellent.

600
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,830
Yixin is facing stagnation.

601
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,590
And now Lemi.

602
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,520
I was still worrying for Mr. Mo
yesterday.

603
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,310
He's close to getting fired.

604
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,280
What should he do?

605
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,110
Now everything's fine.

606
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,110
We can sleep in peace.

607
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,950
We still have time.

608
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,070
I have the patience.

609
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,230
Mr. Han.

610
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,760
You have to have that patience too.

611
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,640
Mo,

612
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,430
the person in charge of Yixin is
an old acquaintance of yours.

613
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,160
You can't waver just because of that.

614
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,430
If someone took advantage of this,

615
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,430
it would all be for nothing.

616
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,800
Mr. Mo.

617
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,950
Sometimes we have to give up something
for the greater good.

618
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,800
For some things,

619
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,160
we have to sacrifice them.

620
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,160
We shouldn't be
penny wise and pound foolish.

621
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,300
( Mo Lingze: Shangger Investment. Any interset?
Eve: Investment?)

622
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,950
I'm afraid this is
going to disappoint Mr. Han.

623
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,430
I never miss.

624
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,350
Mr. Zhai.

625
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,190
The negative comments on the Internet

626
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,590
are getting worse.

627
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,640
I think

628
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,760
the best solution is

629
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,070
to release an apology from Lyuluo.

630
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,710
We can't say for certain if it's plagiarism.

631
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,350
All the comments on the Internet are
just following suit.

632
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,560
Apologizing might be Mr. Long's way.

633
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,110
So does Miss Xu have a better solution?

634
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,800
You can tell us.

635
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,470
Mr. Zhai,

636
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,830
we found music experts.

637
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,190
If we can determine that
this song is not a work of plagiarism,

638
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,310
we still have the initiative.

639
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
But if we apologize,

640
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,950
the nature of it changes.

641
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,640
Qingyou.

642
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,310
Lemi is already in a trust crisis.

643
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,040
We can't wait anymore.

644
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,040
I understand.

645
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,800
I will take care of it.

646
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,040
I will be responsible for it.

647
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,070
No one will take this off my shoulders.

648
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,830
I will certainly not apologize.

649
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,680
Why should I apologize?

650
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,470
I'm the victim.

651
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm even going to sue those

652
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,800
who ruin my name in the Internet.

653
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,230
You have no proof.

654
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,680
Do you think anyone will
believe in you now?

655
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,680
I do.

656
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,710
If you are determined and confident,

657
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,350
I will take care of the rest.

658
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,710
Why are you here?

659
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,520
I was just passing by.

660
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,950
I came here to blackmail my sister.

661
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,470
But she didn't come.

662
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,470
You should be ashamed of yourself.

663
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,160
You deserve it.

664
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,760
Can't you show a bit more care to

665
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,800
your cute brother?

666
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,640
Haven't I shown you enough care?

667
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,230
Don't think of me today.

668
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,760
I have something to do.

669
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,350
Then.

670
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,760
I can stay with you.

671
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,070
Blackmail me.

672
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,280
I have made an appointment today
to go boxing.

673
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,680
Well, I'm here.

674
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,190
Bring me with you.

675
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,070
You're actually pretty good.
Why did you pretend to be a first timer?

676
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,430
Are you playing with me?

677
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,430
The instructions you gave me

678
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,430
made me better understand.

679
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,640
Don't flatter me.

680
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,350
Really, when did you learn boxing?

681
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,520
Well,

682
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,680
it was after you went on that blind date.

683
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,280
Did you think of going after that man

684
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,710
to beat him up?

685
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,280
Of course not.

686
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,230
I don't know how to throw a punch,

687
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,400
but I can take a punch.

688
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,830
There is no question that I will stand
in front of you

689
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,830
to protect you from everything.

690
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,760
You're a decent fellow.

691
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,070
Then let me teach you a technique.

692
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,560
Next time if you meet someone tough,

693
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,350
remember one word,

694
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,680
run.

695
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,760
I would pull you along if I run.

696
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,070
Thanks.

697
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,230
The comparison is a bit complicated.

698
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,040
Give me something easier to understand.

699
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,520
Okay.

700
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,680
Hello.

701
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,160
Please wait two minutes
for the two cups of Americano.

702
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,950
Thank you.

703
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,520
You're welcome.

704
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,070
Coffee time?

705
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Looks like Miss Xu found a solution.

706
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,070
Well, I wouldn't say I solved
the problem completely,

707
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,230
but I could say progress has been made.

708
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,190
Lyuluo insisted that her song was original

709
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,000
and showed me her draft.

710
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,710
Her draft predates the date
when Eve released the song.

711
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,160
This is good news for us.

712
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,040
Sounds great.

713
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,160
But I think it's going to be hard

714
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,000
to convince the public.

715
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,160
Perhaps

716
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,680
I can help.

717
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,040
However, it seems like

718
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,560
there's too many favours for you to return.

719
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,190
This is Lemi and Shangge's crisis,

720
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,680
and we have to face this together.

721
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,230
I already told you my plan.

722
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,280
Mr. Mo, you're being petty now,

723
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,800
not telling me what your plan is.

724
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,520
You'll find out soon.
