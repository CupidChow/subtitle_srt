=Love at Night=

2
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,650
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:33,919
I disagree.

4
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
I stayed in the hospital all night yesterday,

5
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,599
and I am now exhausted.

6
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,599
Invalid disagreement.

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,440
Do not forget our appointment.

8
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:41,760
I decide

9
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:42,919
the place.

10
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,160
What is going on

11
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,199
in Director Xu's mind?

12
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,319
Nothing.

13
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,480
Sixty-five minutes.

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,720
What?

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,160
I want to thank Mr. Mo

16
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,400
for setting up such a big round for me

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,160
to make up for 65 minutes' sleep.

18
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,960
You are so dangerous,

19
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,520
what if I like you too much

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,639
and can't control myself?

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,919
Then don't  control.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,399
Stay being like this

23
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,320
and take the risk.

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,919
I'm afraid to be in the danger

25
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,880
of a broken heart.

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,279
I won't let you get hurt.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
How is the operation?

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,639
Quite well.

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,080
Already out of danger.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,440
Right,

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,880
I wasn't at the wine party yesterday,

32
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,440
did anyone covet my male partner?

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,479
Maybe.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,240
Was there any one beautiful

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,800
or better-shaped

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
or understand better...

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,160
I didn't notice.

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Then what about Lin Siyu?

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,320
Did she go there yesterday?

40
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,559
Did she occupy the position of mine as your partner?

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,399
Wang Ji picked her up.

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,600
Then she...

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,679
Fifty-five minutes left.

44
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,320
But...

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,160
Sleep.

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,839
OK.

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,399
In the market, there are still several other companies

48
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,639
that are eyeing Taikang.

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,880
After this signing,

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,759
we will

51
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,279
finally become its shareholder

52
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,279
with 37% of the shares.

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
Well done!

54
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,000
Then hurry up to implement the contract

55
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,360
in case there are any variables.

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,479
Don't worry,

57
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,479
it's already arranged.

58
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,160
Mr. Mo is really promising.

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,759
Taikang has been gaining momentum in recent years,

60
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,320
and many companies are eyeing it.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,080
I didn’t expect Mr. Mo to break through the siege

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and get its shares.

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
How else can I make such a great effort

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,759
to hire him?

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,279
Mr. Han,

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,479
you have to try harder

67
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,559
for Weirui Tech.

68
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,960
OK.

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't worry.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,839
It's weird

71
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,960
you should even worry about love affairs.

72
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,000
Not really.

73
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,639
I'm

74
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,559
just a little annoyed.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,399
Then have a try.

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
You mean

77
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,640
I try to get along with him?

78
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,119
The person who upsets you

79
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,239
is definitely not ordinary.

80
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,880
Just tell me whether you like him or not.

81
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,760
I can't.

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,320
We are not a good match at all.

83
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,279
This is impossible.

84
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,600
Why not?

85
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,600
Because

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,440
I...

87
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,000
Fang Qi.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,839
I really think you are weird.

89
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,440
When did you

90
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,600
become so nagging?

91
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,880
I'm not nagging with you.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,640
I'm discussing with you cautiously.

93
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,079
Didn’t you tell me before

94
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,679
to put the man down

95
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,600
or let him out?

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,000
Isn't this what you told me?

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,559
Never mind.

98
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,239
Go back to your work.

99
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,720
Let me digest it myself.

100
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,480
Bye.

101
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,280
(Takeout is on the way, please wait)

102
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,399
The data of Taikang we provided

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,440
is perfect this time

104
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,399
and Mo Lingze really got fooled.

105
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,399
He is such a keen person,

106
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,040
didn't he suspect?

107
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
It's too late to be suspicious.

108
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,000
The investment agreement will be sent out soon.

109
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,559
He has always been defiant

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,880
and it seems that this time he is going to stumble.

111
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,399
Thanks to Lawyer Fan

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,320
for persuading Taikang.

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,239
Greedy people don’t have to be persuaded.

114
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,480
In order to get the favor of more investors,

115
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,040
they are willing to take risks.

116
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,200
Lawyer Fan,

117
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,839
you are crueler than me.

118
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,600
I just want to kick Mo Lingze out of Shangger,

119
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,720
but with your trick,

120
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,359
no one in the entire investment community

121
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,359
will hire him.

122
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,359
What he took from me,

123
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,239
I will ask him to double it back.

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,559
What?

125
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,320
Taikang Biological Project has a problem?

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,079
I'm not sure, just an intuition.

127
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,440
I have no evidence yet.

128
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,959
But we have checked carefully before,

129
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,160
and the data is right.

130
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,959
Then check again,

131
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,119
and see which link went wrong.

132
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,920
We've been following up for so long.

133
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,880
This is the last step,

134
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,760
it shouldn't be...

135
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,679
Don't take any chances.

136
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,760
OK.

137
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,480
But

138
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,799
the legal department is already reviewing
the investment agreement.

139
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,880
Intercept as soon as possible.

140
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,720
This is where you must bring me to?

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,480
Right.

142
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,119
How fast time passes.

143
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:31,119
Many of the facilities here have been changed,

144
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,080
and we have grown up.

145
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,400
You grew up,

146
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,239
I've always been an adult, okay?

147
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,440
What on earth is your wish?

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,679
Wait.

149
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,679
Hello, an ice cream.

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,880
Thank you.

151
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,320
This is it.

152
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,359
Buying you an ice cream.

153
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,400
This is it?

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,559
This is it.

155
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,080
Because I’m Xu Qingyou's younger brother,

156
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,400
so

157
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,960
when I was young, I was also your younger brother.

158
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,359
You always let me follow behind you,

159
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,919
bought me ice cream

160
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,919
and played around with me.

161
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,039
Sometimes you quarreled with those kids

162
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,039
in order to get the seesaw.

163
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:30,679
You were not afraid of the boys

164
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,280
who were older

165
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,719
and taller than you.

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,479
From that moment on,

167
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,039
I wanted to grow up.

168
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,599
I wanted to grow up quickly

169
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,960
and grow taller than you,

170
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,159
so that I could become

171
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,520
a man next to you

172
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,719
to protect you

173
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
instead of the younger brother
who has been protected by you.

174
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,880
I didn't expect

175
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,479
you have so many things in your mind

176
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,200
when you were a kid.

177
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,640
I always thought that

178
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,200
this place should be where I say I love you

179
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,119
but I didn’t expect it to be

180
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,799
a place to say goodbye to you.

181
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,119
I know that

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,119
true love is fulfillment

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,080
not possession.

184
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,559
I like you.

185
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,400
I don’t want you to be aggrieved,

186
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,559
so I’m willing to take a step back.

187
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,520
However,

188
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,479
if you encounter any difficulties

189
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,640
in the future,

190
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,080
I will always be there.

191
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:45,760
Of course,

192
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,719
including dating.

193
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,200
What do you mean?

194
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,599
It means

195
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,520
when you figure it out,

196
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,000
and are willing to date with me,

197
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,400
tell me,

198
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,719
I will definitely come back.

199
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,320
But,

200
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,880
if it wasn't for your initiative,

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
I would never disturb you again.

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,599
Fine,

203
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,200
I have to go.

204
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,679
Take care.

205
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,919
Bye-bye.

206
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:25,960
Bye.

207
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,520
Coming.

208
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,599
Please.

209
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,400
Waiting for a long time? There was a traffic jam today.

210
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,799
No.

211
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,919
Please.

212
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,039
How about it? Sincere enough?

213
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,119
The takeaway

214
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,599
is really sincere.

215
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,200
So perfunctory.

216
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,200
I don't know how to cook.

217
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,559
Well,

218
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,400
how about this?

219
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,280
Not enough.

220
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,599
Sister,

221
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,280
open the door please.

222
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,520
I'm coming for dinner.

223
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,799
Can I pretend not to be at home?

224
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,440
Sister,

225
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,760
I don't want to go.

226
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,440
Open the door or I will come in by myself.

227
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,080
Coming.

228
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,919
What?

229
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,320
Dinner.

230
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,559
What took you so long

231
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,039
to open the door?

232
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,440
You have a guest.

233
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,919
This is Mr. Mo.

234
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,400
This is my brother, Xu Wei.

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,919
I mainly want to thank Mr. Mo.

236
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,000
Please, Mr. Mo.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,400
I didn't help much.

238
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,840
I don't deserve your thanks.

239
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,880
You deserve it.

240
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,359
If you feel that

241
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,679
my sincerity is not enough,

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,559
I will treat you to a richer meal someday.

243
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,080
Okay?

244
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,119
Deal.

245
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,840
The flowers and candles

246
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
are far too...

247
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,359
Far too what?

248
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,440
People who don’t know

249
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,679
will think you two are in an underground relationship.

250
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,039
What do you know as a kid?

251
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,119
Nonsense.

252
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,679
I haven't asked you yet.

253
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,440
Why did you suddenly come for dinner?

254
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,520
I just miss you.

255
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,320
Can't I?

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,880
Do you think I will believe you, Xu Wei?

257
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,119
Did you run out of living expenses?

258
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,840
Can you

259
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,520
stop seeing me as a snob?

260
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,599
Can't I come because of something else?

261
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,520
Because of what?

262
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:28,919
You...

263
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,359
I want to eat the meal you cook.

264
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,280
I can cook? When did this happen?

265
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,919
I just have nowhere to eat,

266
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,000
so I just come for dinner.

267
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,280
Mr. Mo,

268
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,119
do you have someone you like?

269
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,880
Yeah.

270
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,440
Are you dating?

271
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,880
I suppose so.

272
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,679
So envious of you.

273
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,119
Nothing to be envious of.

274
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
My girlfriend thinks a lot

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,760
and doesn’t want to make it public.

276
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,200
Then she's going too far,

277
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,359
but I feel much better.

278
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,640
For what?

279
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,799
You don't have a girlfriend.

280
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,599
Don't comment.

281
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,520
I think Xu Wei made a lot of sense.

282
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,200
Yeah.

283
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,440
The chopsticks are dirty, let me wash them.

284
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll go to the bathroom by the way.

285
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,320
What are you doing? Xu Wei is still here.

286
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,119
Punishment.

287
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,960
For what?

288
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Breaking the appointment again.

289
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,039
Fine.

290
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,599
Then I will make you

291
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,960
an official date tomorrow after work, OK?

292
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,039
Can I still trust you?

293
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,440
Yeah.

294
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,559
I'll trust you again.

295
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,640
Sister, bring me some tissues, please.

296
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,000
The tissues are running out.

297
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:38,919
Hurry up.

298
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,119
OK.

299
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,440
The data released to the outside

300
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,280
is of course sounding and perfect.

301
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,520
But take a look.

302
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,840
Jump tickets, out-of-order numbers,

303
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,039
these are to make it impossible to verify.

304
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,960
Besides,

305
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,960
Taikang has carried out another round of financing.

306
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,799
The amount is much larger than the expansion needs.

307
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,839
So there must be a problem with their capital chain.

308
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
There are some data

309
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,119
only held by some key people.

310
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,520
There is a capable person

311
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,800
who may have channels to help you.

312
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,760
Who's that?

313
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,310
(President Tang Xi)

314
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,439
Let me tell you,

315
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,920
Poker Face is

316
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,040
a harsh and perverted

317
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,119
abuser.

318
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,680
He is a big fire pit.

319
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,719
He makes Wang Ji and I stay up late
to work overtime every day.

320
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,040
It drives me crazy.

321
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,959
Fortunately, you didn't jump in.

322
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,239
(Steps to make up to Mo.)
Isn't this pretty rigorous?

323
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,920
In line with his usual style.

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,920
Did you take the wrong medicine to speak for him?

325
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,239
Oh right,

326
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:57,400
do you have a photo of the Botanic Garden Restaurant

327
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,719
you recommended me last time?

328
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,560
You can take a look on its website.

329
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,319
The atmosphere of the restaurant is really good.

330
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,880
In addition to the plants,

331
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,920
there is also a dance floor and a band.

332
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,040
A lot of people go there to propose marriage.

333
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,920
Band.

334
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
(Fourth step: Band plan)

335
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,319
What's this?

336
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,599
Still want to hide from me.

337
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Let's be honest.

338
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,920
What's the situation?

339
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,800
Tell you the truth,

340
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,000
I have

341
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,640
jumped into that fire pit.

342
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,760
You and Poker Face...

343
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,079
Keep your voice down.

344
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
Can you?

345
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,479
I'll let go.

346
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,280
Xu Qingyou, you are going too far.

347
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,040
You dare to hide such a big thing from me.

348
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,959
Actually,

349
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,040
I didn’t want to hide it from you.

350
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,079
I just didn’t find a suitable time

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,319
to tell you.

352
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,920
When did it happen?

353
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,000
How far have you gone?

354
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,439
Did you do everything that people in love do?

355
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,239
Tell me everything clearly.

356
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,079
Be lenient with confession and strict with resistance.

357
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Tell me.

358
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,920
Lingze,

359
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,880
it's been a long time.

360
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,880
Your suit fits you well,

361
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,959
and your tie is not bad.

362
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,239
Mr. Luo introduced me

363
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,199
for the purpose of Taikang Biological Project.

364
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:42,959
Shangger holds

365
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,760
37% of Taikang's shares.

366
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,599
But this week

367
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,040
we found that

368
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,880
Taikang is suspected of falsifying sales figures.

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,199
What does it have to do with me?

370
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,920
Taikang has been gaining momentum

371
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,839
in the capital market in recent years.

372
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,359
Isn’t Miss Tang also staring at it?

373
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
After so many years,

374
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:05,079
you still care about me so much.

375
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,520
If I care a little bit about you,

376
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,199
I should have found that you have watched for months

377
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,479
but haven’t entered the game so long.

378
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,119
You must have known the inside story beforehand.

379
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,920
We need the data you have.

380
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,199
Of course,

381
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,880
you're a businesswoman,

382
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,880
so we won’t ask for help empty-handed.

383
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:29,760
After it is done,

384
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,079
Shangger is willing to

385
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,640
hand over 5% of the shares of Taikang.

386
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,520
If this is the case,

387
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,839
Shangger’s sincerity is not enough, right?

388
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,280
You make the condition.

389
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,800
You.

390
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,800
My condition is you.

391
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,400
I'm afraid that the sincerity you want

392
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,920
is not something that Shanger can afford.

393
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,920
Don't you want the evidence of forgery?

394
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:16,119
The tie was a sword wipe for soldiers in ancient Rome.

395
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,839
Today is your first business negotiation.

396
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,400
I will accompany you,

397
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,439
and see you return home in triumph.

398
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,079
Mr. Mo.

399
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,119
I went into the water to shoot today

400
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,599
and got a glorious fever.

401
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,079
Can the appointment be rescheduled for another time

402
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,680
so as not to bother you?

403
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,719
Here.

404
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,040
Thank you.

405
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,400
It's all right to work hard,

406
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,719
but you have to look after yourself.

407
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,920
Do whatever others ask you to do?

408
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,359
What? Feel sorry for me?

409
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,239
This is nothing.

410
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,160
Isn't it for shooting?

411
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,760
Others didn't want to go,

412
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,439
so I had to be the stand-in.

413
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,359
You call this nothing?

414
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm telling you Xu Qingyou,

415
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,479
if you don't take care of yourself,

416
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
you will be punished.

417
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,119
I got it.

418
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,359
Don't be angry, please.

419
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,160
Shall I make amends?

420
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,239
By the way, I feel better now.

421
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
I have booked the Botanical Gardens Restaurant.

422
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,640
Why don't we go eat together now?

423
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,839
You're not going anywhere today.

424
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,959
Rest at home.

425
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
That was carefully prepared,

426
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,520
how can we just not go?

427
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,839
Look, I am definitely OK right now.

428
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,400
Are you still going?

429
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,839
Don't touch me, I've got a runny nose.

430
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,800
Give me a tissue.

431
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,079
Here.

432
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,280
Give it to me.

433
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,079
Drink more water.

434
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,439
Look at what you are doing everyday.

435
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Paint at night

436
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,599
and teach children during the day.

437
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,640
Can you bear it?

438
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,040
Don't talk to me now.

439
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:59,640
I haven't closed my eyes for several days.

440
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,199
You can't do this.

441
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,599
Don't you die young

442
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,000
before Qi falls in love with you.

443
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,479
Let me tell you,

444
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,719
there are so many people who die because of overwork.

445
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:07,760
If something really happened to you,

446
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,040
it wouldn't be a work injury.

447
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,040
Although I promised Fang Qi

448
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,920
not to bother her,

449
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,520
if she has any difficulties,

450
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,760
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

451
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,959
What? Yunhai Tech again?

452
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:22,880
You tell that Mr. Wang,

453
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,800
I don’t have time to accompany him to figure it out.

454
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,359
I just vent,

455
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,800
can I really quit?

456
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,359
I'm outside now.

457
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,800
I'll go back later and change it for you.

458
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,400
That's it.

459
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,160
Fang Qi.

460
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Let's go.

461
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,479
(The darn Mr. Wang)
The capitalist again.

462
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,280
Don't do it, you are an artist.

463
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,640
No,

464
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,000
if he troubles me now,

465
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
he won’t trouble Fang Qi.

466
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,959
Hello.

467
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,520
I saw your painting.

468
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:04,280
The color is so dark, I can’t see it clearly at night.

469
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,560
Didn't you say it's too bright?

470
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,880
Is this your attitude?

471
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,680
Fine.

472
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,800
I will modify it tomorrow.

473
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,199
No, come and modify it now.

474
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,319
Wait a minute, Mr. Wang.

475
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,599
I promised you to paint for free

476
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,719
and I will definitely finish it on time.

477
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,719
What about your promise to me?

478
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,800
Here, Dalang,

479
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:36,920
take the medicine.

480
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,599
No.

481
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,319
Didn't I drink a bowl of medicine yesterday?

482
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,239
But you haven't recovered from your cold.

483
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,040
Come on.

484
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm over my cold,

485
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:47,160
and I seriously suspect that

486
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,959
you are taking the opportunity to punish me.

487
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,920
You are not responsible for your own health,

488
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,280
shouldn't you be punished?

489
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,160
It's too bitter.

490
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,520
Come on.

491
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,400
You really won't drink?

492
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,079
Fine.

493
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,280
It took me half an hour to boil it,

494
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,839
if you don’t drink, I will pour it out.

495
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll take a sip reluctantly.

496
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,439
Good girl, here.

497
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,880
Is it hot?

498
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,599
No.

499
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,599
Bitter.

500
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,680
Just bear it and it will be over soon.

501
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,239
Stop.

502
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:48,719
Reward.

503
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,000
I actually think

504
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,560
you are quite caring.

505
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,400
You've taken care of people before, haven't you?

506
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,319
Of course.

507
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,599
Who was that?

508
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:11,280
Bobo, and his little Bobo.

509
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,719
(Wang Ji)

510
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,280
(Wang Ji)
Hello?

511
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:18,599
(Wang Ji)

512
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,239
(Wang Ji)
Hello, Mr. Mo.

513
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Lin Siyu is gone.

514
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,280
She didn’t answer WeChat and the phone.

515
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,400
Has she contacted you?

516
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,599
Wang Ji, where are you now?

517
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,439
We will go to find you.

518
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:33,760
I will send you a location.

519
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,199
Right away.

520
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,760
Are you sure it's here?

521
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,920
I didn't find her here, how about you?

522
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,880
Me neither.

523
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:42,800
Let's meet first.

524
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,040
Ok, see you later.

525
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,040
(Yesterday. Lin Siyu: Goodbye)

526
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,520
How's it?

527
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,119
Mr. Mo.

528
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
Let's go find her over there.

529
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,560
You go on.

530
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,280
I'll go there.

531
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,000
Hello, is Lin Siyu here?

532
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,199
No.

533
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,319
Lin Siyu, Lin Siyu.

534
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,800
Seems not at home.

535
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,280
Let's go.

536
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,839
Hold on.

537
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,280
What's the date today?

538
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,400
21st.

539
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,400
Lingze,

540
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,040
there will be a pineapple party
on the 21st of next month.

541
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,199
How about I invite you to have pineapple steak

542
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:35,800
on King’s Island?

543
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,000
I know where she is.

544
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,280
Get in the car.

545
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,479
Wang Ji, go to King's Island.

546
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,599
Bury her!

547
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,119
No one can find her in a while.

548
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:10,800
Young girl,

549
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,040
can you hide me, too?

550
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,800
Do you also want to play hide and seek?

551
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,280
Yeah.

552
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,439
I want no one to find me.

553
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,400
Sister, you are an adult.

554
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,000
You are too big for us to hide.

555
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,160
Yeah.

556
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,760
I'm an adult.

557
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,479
I can't hide.

558
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,439
Hello, madam.

559
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,040
How can I help you?

560
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,880
What is your most signature dish?

561
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,040
Pineapple Steak.

562
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,079
Pineapple is the freshest in our shop,

563
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,280
and the steak is the rib-eye steak delivered by air.

564
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,920
It is highly recommended with limited daily supply.

565
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,000
Pineapple Steak, medium rare.

566
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,760
I'm sorry ma'am.

567
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:03,560
That gentleman

568
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,959
just ordered the last one.

569
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:06,719
Fine, thank you.

570
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,040
Sir,

571
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,760
I want to discuss something with you.

572
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,479
I'll treat your meal,

573
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,000
can you give me

574
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,800
the last pineapple steak?

575
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,079
Do I look like someone who can't afford a meal?

576
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,560
Please,

577
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,920
I've come all this way,

578
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,719
will you let me come for nothing?

579
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,160
How about this?

580
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Let's exchange WeChat,

581
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
and next time I'll treat you to something else.

582
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
I'm a food expert.

583
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,719
I know all the Michelin in town.

584
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:02,880
With such a handsome face,

585
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,319
yet he has no manners at all.

586
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,920
Here's your steak.

587
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,119
It's from that gentleman.

588
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,319
Thank you.

589
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,439
Lin Siyu.

590
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,359
Lin Siyu.

591
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,599
Let's find her.

592
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,880
Lin Siyu.

593
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,520
Lin Siyu.

594
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,439
What are you doing here?

595
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,719
Do you know how worried we are?

596
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,760
I just want to be an ostrich

597
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,239
and be alone, can't I?

598
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,359
Are you done?

599
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,760
Go back.

600
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,800
None of your business.

601
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,119
Why are you here if you hate me so much?

602
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,959
If he hated you,

603
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,319
he wouldn't have looked for you everywhere

604
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,920
and couldn't have remembered this place.

605
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,920
I know you don't like me,

606
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,119
but can you have dinner with me one last time?

607
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Isn't it just a meal?

608
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,040
Today is the 21st of October.

609
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,040
It was here

610
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,080
that we first met

611
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,879
three years ago

612
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,000
because of a steak.

613
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,679
Help yourself.

614
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,399
It's on me.

615
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,479
I admit I like you a lot,

616
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,800
but I just realized

617
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
that you're sharp, difficult,

618
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,879
cold-blooded, arrogant and particularly uncaring.

619
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,679
But I, Li Siyu,

620
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,199
don't like to owe people,

621
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:02,280
so let's have this meal

622
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:04,800
and be done with it.

623
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,439
After today,

624
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,120
I'm off to my next target.

625
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,719
Don't regret then.

626
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:27,840
Siyu,

627
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:29,840
Wish you happiness.
