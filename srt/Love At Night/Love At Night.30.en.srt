3
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:36,308
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:38,187
I can't promise you.

5
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:49,667
It's not the right time.

6
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:57,267
You are so serious.

7
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:58,267
I knew it.

8
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,068
I knew he wouldn't agree.

9
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,108
He is Poker Face.

10
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:03,228
You made the bet,

11
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:03,787
but lost.

12
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:05,428
Money, give me money. Come on.

13
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:05,868
Right.

14
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:07,708
Folk it over.

15
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:09,187
My treat.

16
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:10,868
That's it?

17
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,068
Sore loser!

18
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:12,627
No.

19
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,068
Lingze.

20
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:13,548
You thought

21
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:15,068
she was proposing to you?

22
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:16,708
Just kidding.

23
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,028
And you.

24
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:20,908
Playing dumb.

25
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:21,627
I tell you,

26
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:24,347
(Mr. Mo. I have something important to tell you)
it's usually men who propose to women.

27
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:25,307
Don't take this seriously.

28
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,108
He must have his own mind.

29
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:29,028
No.

30
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:29,627
Pay me.

31
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,307
Qingyou.

32
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:31,947
I'm in a rush.

33
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:32,908
I’ve gotta go.

34
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:35,508
OK.

35
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,667
Wait for me at home.

36
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,428
Where is he going?

37
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,907
He is so

38
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:49,907
unromantic.

39
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:50,987
Don't be angry.

40
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:52,907
I'm fine.

41
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:53,708
Come on.

42
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,428
Let's have one.

43
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:55,188
Come on.

44
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,987
Take a seat.

45
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,987
I gotta go.

46
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:02,428
What?

47
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,307
What a mess!

48
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,108
He did wrong today.

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,200
(Why does a boyfriend refuse his girlfriend's proposal?)

50
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:29,428
He may have terminal illness,

51
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:30,627
and let you go for you.

52
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,667
He doesn't wanna drag you down.

53
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,987
He's likely a love rat and doesn't want to marry.

54
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:35,227
Liar!

55
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:36,108
Break up with him!

56
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:37,907
Playboy.

57
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:38,988
Self-seeking.

58
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:40,108
Feckless.

59
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,227
Who's it?

60
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:54,548
Hello.

61
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:55,667
Are you Miss Xu?

62
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:57,028
Yeah.

63
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:58,468
It's yours.

64
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,307
Could you please tell me the delivery code?

65
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:02,908
OK.

66
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:06,227
7506.

67
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:07,388
Okay. Thanks.

68
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,108
(Mom)
Youyou.

69
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,468
Received the soup, right?

70
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:16,947
Take it to Mo.

71
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:17,787
He's had a hard time lately.

72
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:18,787
He needs feeding up some.

73
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,427
Only caring about him.

74
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,787
I think he is in good health.

75
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:26,867
Why don't you give it to me?

76
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:34,348
Is it necessary to spend so much time

77
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:35,348
choosing such a place?

78
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,988
Shangger Capital is strong now.

79
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:39,787
Anyone could be their spy.

80
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:41,268
Although it's not easy to find here,

81
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:42,507
it's absolutely safe here.

82
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,188
We have to pay a huge amount of money?

83
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:56,468
Yes.

84
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,307
If we can't solve it quickly,

85
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,108
this is the only way.

86
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:10,307
Although I didn't earn much money,

87
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:11,908
I saved some

88
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:13,388
because of stinginess.

89
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:14,667
After estimating,

90
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,787
I can give you

91
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:18,908
three quarters of it.

92
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,188
I'm afraid that's not enough.

93
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,147
Four fifths.

94
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:27,667
No more.

95
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,748
Or I can't live here.

96
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:31,908
Great.

97
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:34,628
You don't fail me.

98
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:36,507
Stop joking, please.

99
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:38,507
All right.

100
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:40,268
Put it away.

101
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:42,507
I haven't come to a dead end yet.

102
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:47,707
The material you gave me is detailed

103
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:48,547
and comprehensive.

104
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,307
But in fact, there is

105
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:53,387
only one key person.

106
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:03,587
What are you doing?

107
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:04,188
Come with me.

108
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:04,867
Don't drag me.

109
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:05,948
I'll shout if you do like this.

110
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:08,147
What are you doing?

111
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:09,028
Put me down.

112
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:09,827
Taxi.

113
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:12,867
Xu Wei.

114
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:13,908
Would you...

115
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:16,267
Would you stop hiding me anything?

116
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,508
You're weird.

117
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:22,267
Fang Qi.

118
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,228
We're now back to

119
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:25,987
the last ten minutes of December 31.

120
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,748
The new year is coming,

121
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,707
and this time we'll celebrate it together.

122
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,107
This is how you turn back the clock,

123
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:34,748
right?

124
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:39,147
Am I childish?

125
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:40,628
You're not only childish,

126
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:41,628
but also stupid.

127
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,188
I asked you not to call me on the New Year's Eve,

128
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:45,827
and then you did so?

129
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,068
You asked me not to call you,

130
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:49,468
I didn't dare to do that.

131
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,188
I was afraid you would be angry.

132
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:54,547
Forget it.

133
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:57,827
Let's go back in time.

134
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:04,307
What do you wanna do now?

135
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:07,827
You'll do anything with me?

136
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:13,307
Come on.

137
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:13,788
Go.

138
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:16,267
Bro.

139
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:16,827
What would you like?

140
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:19,468
Two antler-shaped headwear.

141
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:20,188
Two?

142
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,188
Here you are.

143
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:22,068
Thanks.

144
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:22,628
You're welcome.

145
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:23,668
It's too...

146
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,147
You promised me.

147
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:30,147
Wow.

148
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,668
It looks good on her head.

149
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:33,668
She's my girlfriend.

150
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:35,668
50 yuan.

151
00:07:36,587 --> 00:07:36,788
OK.

152
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:38,827
You're honey-tongued.

153
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:43,668
Here you are.

154
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:44,028
OK.

155
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:44,628
Thanks.

156
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:45,628
Let's go.

157
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:46,827
Take care.

158
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:48,668
Come.

159
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:49,387
Stand here.

160
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:49,948
Don't move.

161
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,668
Good hide.

162
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:02,628
It's beautiful.

163
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:15,147
Fang Qi.

164
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:17,028
Happy New Year.

165
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:20,267
Happy New Year.

166
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,267
Are you angry?

167
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,348
For I said no to your proposal?

168
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:30,228
No, I'm not.

169
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,188
Don't flatter yourself.

170
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,788
I just bet with them.

171
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:35,188
What's wrong?

172
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:36,748
Scared you?

173
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:39,587
Not yet.

174
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:41,788
I was just a little surprised.

175
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:44,028
All the same.

176
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:45,468
No.

177
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:48,228
Being scared means saying no.

178
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,348
But being surprised means

179
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:53,267
beyond control and anticipation.

180
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,788
You mean

181
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:57,628
if you agree to marry me,

182
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,188
there will be many things

183
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,827
beyond your control and anticipation?

184
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:03,908
Rationally,

185
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:05,187
yes.

186
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:07,548
A lot of

187
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:08,308
difficult things

188
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:09,428
to solve recently?

189
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,028
You won't believe if I say no.

190
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:21,147
I hope to face

191
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,428
these difficulties with you

192
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:27,147
whether as your girlfriend

193
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,108
or as your fiancée.

194
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:33,507
I'm just...

195
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:36,108
afraid of you...

196
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,228
What?

197
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:44,947
You're afraid I'm an irresponsible

198
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:46,947
playboy

199
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:52,267
or the one who only loves without marrying you?

200
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,387
Which one are you?

201
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:02,267
Neither I am.

202
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:07,348
My mom made chicken soup.

203
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:08,308
Enjoy it.

204
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:09,147
I gotta go.

205
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:11,947
I said no

206
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:13,267
because

207
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,147
I didn't wanna make a hasty decision

208
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,147
at such a special moment.

209
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:19,747
If I said yes,

210
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:22,387
I was not responsible for our future.

211
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:26,988
The soup is getting cold.

212
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:28,228
I'm leaving.

213
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:41,747
Good night.

214
00:12:05,147 --> 00:12:05,988
How's it going, Mr. Mo?

215
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:07,988
Have you found a solution yet?

216
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:09,548
There was plenty of time

217
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:10,668
and support given by us.

218
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,468
But there's no progress at all.

219
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,707
We can only wait for investors to pull out?

220
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:17,627
Free trading

221
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:18,707
in financial markets.

222
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,028
I can't help.

223
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:22,908
Mr. Mo, what are you saying?

224
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:23,707
Truth.

225
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,308
Divestment is not terrible,

226
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,267
so long as there's new investment.

227
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:35,507
Mr. Zhang.

228
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:36,348
Why are you here?

229
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,228
Everyone's here.

230
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,108
Mr. Mo is right.

231
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,187
So long as there is new investment

232
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:45,267
to ensure the capital chain.

233
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:46,868
Mr. Zhang.

234
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,348
Are you willing to keep investment?

235
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,108
Rather than keeping investment,

236
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:51,348
I'll add investment.

237
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,108
I'll make up for the part they withdrew.

238
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,147
Let the legal department prepare a new equity contract.

239
00:12:59,187 --> 00:12:59,747
Mr. Zhang.

240
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:00,348
Thanks.

241
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:02,908
Thanks for trusting Shangger.

242
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:04,827
Mr. Mo.

243
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:06,587
Don't forget the terms we negotiated.

244
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,108
From Lemi to Sansheng,

245
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:13,067
here is the investment analysis,

246
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:14,587
operation process,

247
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:15,827
and financial transactions

248
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:17,267
of all cases.

249
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:19,627
Mr. Zhang.

250
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:21,507
After reading these materials,

251
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:23,028
you will understand every choice I made

252
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,548
is for the benefit of Shangger.

253
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,668
Yep, Xu Qingyou is my girlfriend.

254
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,147
But she investigated fakes,

255
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:32,747
made clicks on the Internet exceed 10 million,

256
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:33,908
and launched new departments,

257
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:36,428
enhancing Lemi's brand image.

258
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:37,627
What she has done

259
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,348
is obvious to all.

260
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,108
The so-called Sleep-To-Play

261
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:44,028
is totally nonsense.

262
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:45,788
You said so much

263
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,308
to keep me investing in Shangger?

264
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:50,908
I just hope

265
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,468
you won't miss a promising company.

266
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:56,228
There're many promising ones.

267
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:58,267
Not just yours.

268
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,507
Recently, Tianmeng Game's very popular.

269
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:07,668
Everyone wants to invest it.

270
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,668
I heard you are also interested in it.

271
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:12,668
What a pity.

272
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,548
They don't accept external capital.

273
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:17,428
They don't accept investment

274
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:19,908
while aiming to be a first-class game company.

275
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,747
They lack a network linkage window.

276
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,067
But I have

277
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:26,028
this kind of window.

278
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,308
As a term for you to keep investment,

279
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:35,507
I will try my best to help you invest Tianmeng.

280
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,387
I do want something.

281
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:41,468
But not this one.

282
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,108
It's

283
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:49,827
you.

284
00:14:58,988 --> 00:14:59,627
Mo Lingze

285
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:01,147
has been cherished by Shangger.

286
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:02,428
What's going on?

287
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,147
He was poached by Mr. Zhang.

288
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:06,788
He said he did it for Shangger.

289
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:07,988
In fact,

290
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,228
he is for a higher social position.

291
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,468
He made us look like clowns.

292
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,428
Are you willing to be defeated by him?

293
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:20,267
Not me.

294
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,028
But us.

295
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:23,387
We all lost.

296
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:25,108
Luo has already talked to me.

297
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,627
He actually knows everything.

298
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:29,228
He let us fight

299
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,067
and balance each other

300
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:31,747
just to save himself.

301
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:34,908
Well.

302
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:36,668
He's already known

303
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:37,908
you used the loophole in the contract

304
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,147
to set Shangger up.

305
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:41,228
Get ready to be discharged.

306
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:43,428
Are you going to

307
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,908
shift all the responsibilities to me?

308
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:48,468
We just took advantage of each other.

309
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,707
At this critical moment,

310
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:52,267
a clean getaway is enough.

311
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:58,587
Solved it smoothly?

312
00:15:59,348 --> 00:15:59,908
Yes.

313
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:01,267
So we won't lose our jobs,

314
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:01,988
sell our apartment,

315
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:02,988
take out all our savings,

316
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:04,267
and become poor?

317
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,108
We won't lose our jobs,

318
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:06,187
sell our apartment,

319
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:07,668
and take out all our savings.

320
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,348
We won't become poor.

321
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:14,187
What's the matter?

322
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,587
Happiness comes in sudden.

323
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:19,627
I can't accept it now.

324
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:26,507
Don't you have something to hide

325
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,387
and intend to take it on yourself?

326
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:32,267
In your eyes

327
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:34,507
can't I negotiate well?

328
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:35,348
Yes.

329
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,267
Yes, you have.

330
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:39,348
I'll deal with files.

331
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,468
Coffee is ready for you.

332
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,947
Let's celebrate at home?

333
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:46,587
OK.

334
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:48,827
You just need to eat at night.

335
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:50,707
Wait for me to cook.

336
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:52,348
OK.

337
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:07,587
Hello.

338
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:08,228
Please enjoy.

339
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:09,267
Thanks.

340
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:16,827
Where's Mo Lingze?

341
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:18,627
He left.

342
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:19,468
You come for him?

343
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:20,707
Sure.

344
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,627
I'm going to tell him,

345
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:22,468
he can go wherever he wants,

346
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:23,267
I don't care.

347
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:24,387
But he can't take

348
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:25,187
my darling away.

349
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:27,988
What are you talking about?

350
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,108
Where is Mo Lingze going?

351
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:30,507
You don't know?

352
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,507
In order to keep investment,

353
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:33,947
he promised to work overseas for three years.

354
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,988
Wang Ji will have to follow him.

355
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:39,267
Luckily I have the latest information,

356
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:40,587
or

357
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,668
they will go abroad together.

358
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:42,988
Overseas?

359
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,067
Three years?

360
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:00,747
Am I late?

361
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:03,228
No.

362
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:06,147
I was just thinking about what I heard today.

363
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,147
What can catch your attention?

364
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:09,468
Tell me.

365
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:09,988
I'm ready.

366
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:13,507
Because that's about my boyfriend.

367
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:15,868
I heard,

368
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:18,908
to keep investment of Shangger,

369
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:21,108
you have agreed to work overseas.

370
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,947
The LP did propose such term.

371
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:38,908
So

372
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:40,948
everyone knew.

373
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:47,068
Only I, your girlfriend, didn't know.

374
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,267
You told me

375
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:52,227
to trust you

376
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:53,387
and you would

377
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:55,347
work everything out well.

378
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:57,708
So this is the solution?

379
00:18:58,747 --> 00:18:59,828
Separate from me?

380
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:04,387
I don't understand.

381
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,267
This is about both of us,

382
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:11,507
but I don't even have the right to know.

383
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,467
You made

384
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:15,987
your own decision.

385
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:31,387
If so,

386
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:34,747
let's calm down for a while.

387
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,627
You asked me to stay up all night

388
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:00,668
and looked so sad.

389
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:02,987
What's the matter?

390
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:05,747
Mo Lingze will go abroad

391
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:06,828
for three years.

392
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:09,188
What?

393
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:11,147
Mo Lingze will go abroad?

394
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:12,708
What about you?

395
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,627
What about Shangger?

396
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:15,267
I can't do anything.

397
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:18,147
What about hiring a band
to celebrate his departure?

398
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:21,507
Have you ever thought about

399
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,107
giving up everything for love?

400
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,107
Forget it.

401
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:28,428
We're all adults.

402
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,788
The basic courtesy of adults

403
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:32,908
is to live well

404
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,627
no matter who leaves.

405
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,267
Well.

406
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:39,828
Then wait for him proudly

407
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:42,548
far away.

408
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:45,908
Leave it alone.

409
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:47,428
Enjoy now.

410
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:49,107
After massage,

411
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:51,627
let me drink with you.

412
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:53,708
Deal.

413
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:02,467
How will you pay?

414
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,028
Card.

415
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:03,548
OK.

416
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,387
Hello, Mr. Zhai.

417
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:06,908
Qingyou.

418
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:08,467
Go to Haicheng at once.

419
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:10,308
Haicheng?

420
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:11,028
Today?

421
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:12,227
Yes.

422
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:13,188
OK.

423
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:13,908
No problem.

424
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:16,908
Fang Qi.

425
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,708
Mr. Zhai asked me to go to Haicheng.

426
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,428
I have to go today.

427
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:20,747
I'll leave.

428
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,188
That's it?

429
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,948
In such a hurry?

430
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:31,507
Thanks.

431
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,200
(Poker Face)

432
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:42,147
Hello, Mr. Mo.

433
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:43,387
Where is Xu Qingyou?

434
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:45,467
You're her boyfriend.

435
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,188
You ask me?

436
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:48,668
As my subordinate,

437
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,867
you are obliged to answer me truthfully.

438
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:53,188
I heard you are going abroad.

439
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:54,467
If so,

440
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,227
you won't be my boss soon.

441
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:59,467
I have written a letter of recommendation for

442
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,507
the senior manager of the investment department.

443
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:01,908
It seems that

444
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:03,668
I have to reconsider it.

445
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:04,908
Wait a minute.

446
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:07,467
I'll tell you.

447
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:10,068
You're going abroad.

448
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,908
Xu Qingyou is too upset.

449
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:13,987
So she decided to leave this desperate city.

450
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:15,747
She accepted an assignment from Lemi

451
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:16,788
to go to Haicheng.

452
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,867
But she went by high-speed railway.

453
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:20,347
So you can't go after her

454
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:21,188
by car now.

455
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,028
So...

456
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:23,347
Hello?

457
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:25,828
I haven't finished yet.

458
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:27,068
In a hurry.

459
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:28,188
Both are in a hurry.

460
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:39,308
Hello.

461
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:39,867
Mr. Zhai.

462
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:41,548
I have talked to Mr. Yang

463
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:42,308
of Sanhao Beauty.

464
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,188
He has agreed to work with us again.

465
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:45,948
The previous contract is still valid.

466
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:49,188
I believe in your ability.

467
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:50,627
A reward for you.

468
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:51,788
Mr. Zhai.

469
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:53,948
If you wanna reward me,

470
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:56,627
please give me half a day off.

471
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:57,588
OK.

472
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,188
I heard the scenery there is good.

473
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:00,668
Take advantage of this business trip

474
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:01,987
to get a good rest.

475
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:04,028
Thanks, Mr. Zhai.

476
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:16,467
Poker Face.

477
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:19,828
Poker Face.

478
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,188
Not telling me his going abroad for three years.

479
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:26,747
Tips of darts.

480
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:29,428
Put diopter, sight band balloon aligned.

481
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:32,987
Hit the bull's eye.

482
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:34,627
Thanks.

483
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:36,588
Are you on vacation, too?

484
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:38,588
There are parasailing and hot air balloons.

485
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:40,428
May I have the pleasure of your company?

486
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:42,987
Anyone with fear of heights

487
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:45,908
had better not try these.

488
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:48,948
It doesn't matter.

489
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:49,867
We can go diving.

490
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:52,227
I'm a Master Scuba Diver.

491
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:54,068
It's hot.

492
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,107
I wanna dive so.

493
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:56,588
But as far as I know,

494
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:59,267
you can't swim.

495
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,028
We can go hiking.

496
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:06,107
The scenery on the mountain is good.

497
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,347
OK.

498
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,068
What a strong wind.

499
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:09,708
Camping or climbing?

500
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,867
Too dangerous.

501
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,507
You two are...

502
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:17,828
I have nothing to do with him.

503
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:21,548
Miss.

504
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:23,708
Why not tell me you have a boyfriend?

505
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:25,068
A gentleman won't take love of others.

506
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:26,467
I'm leaving.

507
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:27,387
Take your time.

508
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:28,387
Take it easy.

509
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:43,828
You came here

510
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:44,987
without saying goodbye

511
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,908
just to play darts?

512
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:51,147
You call it a French leave?

513
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:52,387
You are going abroad.

514
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:53,867
What about that?

515
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:56,867
We both have assignments.

516
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:57,788
So we're even.

517
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:58,948
Assignment?

518
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,708
Fang Qi told you that?

519
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,467
If you knew everything,

520
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:05,987
why did you come to me?

521
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:07,387
We should leave a

522
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:08,788
perfect French leave.

523
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:10,147
That's good.

524
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:14,107
Qingyou.

525
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:18,267
Qingyou.

526
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:20,147
You misunderstood.

527
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:22,347
How smart are you!

528
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:23,467
You can even tell my thought.

529
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:26,948
The LP asked me to work overseas with him

530
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,588
for a while to get his help.

531
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:31,987
I didn't tell you

532
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:33,987
because I have been trying to solve it.

533
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:35,948
I got an idea

534
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:37,747
that needs to be settled indeed.

535
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:39,987
Mr. Zhai sent me here

536
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:42,147
to solve a previous case.

537
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,908
I didn't tell you

538
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,588
because the client was in a hurry.

539
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,387
He will leave this afternoon.

540
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:48,668
I'm going to talk to you

541
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:49,708
after this.

542
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:52,188
So

543
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,467
there is no assignment at all?

544
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:57,188
How does it feel

545
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:58,867
to know everything from others?

546
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:01,948
It's bad.

547
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:04,308
Well, you know.

548
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:05,428
Goodbye.

549
00:26:11,347 --> 00:26:12,347
Why do you follow me?

550
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,188
You are not satisfied with me.

551
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:17,147
I have to impress you

552
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:18,747
with sincerity.

553
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,668
If you are really sincere,

554
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:23,908
never separate from me

555
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:25,347
from now on.

556
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:27,147
Yes, madam.

557
00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:30,347
What?

558
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,028
Lawyer Fan.

559
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:31,908
Long time no see.

560
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:36,788
I remember you would get something last time.

561
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:38,028
Have you got it?

562
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:43,788
I just wanna get back my belongings.

563
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:46,387
Am I wrong?

564
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,627
Why did I lose more?

565
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:52,668
It goes like this.

566
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:54,467
In gambling,

567
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:56,308
sometimes the more you wanna win,

568
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:57,548
the more you indulge in,

569
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,068
losing everything easily.

570
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:03,867
Maybe what you want

571
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:05,908
doesn't belong to you anymore.

572
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:11,948
What did you recommend last time?

573
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:15,028
Didn't you say you wouldn't drink anything else?

574
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:16,987
I wanna try today.

575
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:19,428
Come on.

576
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:24,867
Thank you.

577
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:28,588
This one

578
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:30,467
is much better than the last one you drank.

579
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:32,908
Try it.

580
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:41,828
How is it?

581
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:45,948
I don't like it.

582
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:51,267
But it's not bad.

583
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:55,747
It's a good start with something new.

584
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:58,347
This is on me.

585
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:14,668
Why did you call me

586
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:15,948
to come at night?

587
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,068
If you're kidding me,

588
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:18,347
treat me braised pork for a month.

589
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:26,668
What is this?

590
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:28,147
Pompidou Jeune Art.

591
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:30,948
Interpret for me.

592
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:35,467
Pompidou Jeune Art.

593
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:36,747
I was invited.

594
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:38,507
You did?

595
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:40,708
Of course.

596
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:42,028
If you don't believe me,

597
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:43,347
check the list on its official website.

598
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,347
Our studio will become famous.

599
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,588
(Dad)
Come back for dinner with Fang Qi tomorrow night.

600
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:00,068
A double blessing!

601
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,227
Your dad agreed?

602
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:20,267
Thank you.

603
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:35,267
Long time no see.

604
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:37,428
Yeah.

605
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:38,867
Long time no see.

606
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,147
I just canceled my contract with Shangger.

607
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,987
I heard you had interceded for me.

608
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:47,507
Not me.

609
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:49,428
It's Mo Lingze.

610
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:54,708
Actually, I thought he would win.

611
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:56,708
But unexpectedly,

612
00:30:57,428 --> 00:30:59,308
I finally lost to him in this way.

613
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:04,308
I owe you an apology all the time.

614
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:07,668
It's a past.

615
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,867
I'm fine now.

616
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:11,627
Yeah.

617
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:13,627
You're getting better

618
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:15,107
and you have come a long way.

619
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,308
But I'm still where I was.

620
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:22,068
Yunxi.

621
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:24,028
As long as you look ahead,

622
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:26,227
everything will get better.

623
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:28,507
Good luck.

624
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,147
Bye.

625
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:52,028
Have you seen it?

626
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:54,708
Invitation to Pompidou Youth Art Exhibition.

627
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,068
Your brother is going to Paris for an exhibition.

628
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:00,308
He is better after falling in love.

629
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:03,227
Xu Wei, a naughty child,

630
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:05,347
grew up overnight.

631
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,107
A naughty child?

632
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:10,347
Right...

633
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,147
Only I understand

634
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:13,188
his maturity.

635
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:16,227
That's not what you used to think.

636
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:19,588
I wasn't mature enough before.

637
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:20,627
Sorry.

638
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:22,308
You're in love.

639
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:24,588
You too, okay?

640
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:26,627
I dare not speak ill of Mr. Mo now.

641
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:28,227
But I found

642
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:32,227
Mr. Mo no longer always has a poker face.

643
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:34,668
Of course.

644
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:37,948
Don't you get

645
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:40,708
a marriage license before he leaves?

646
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:43,828
I'm in no hurry.

647
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,828
And I'm telling you,

648
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:47,747
I think this platonic long-distance relationship

649
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:49,028
is especially suitable for us.

650
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,267
I like it.

651
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:53,948
See what is this?

652
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:55,627
You don't like to admit it.

653
00:32:55,627 --> 00:32:56,708
I'm telling you,

654
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:57,227
he will leave you.

655
00:32:58,068 --> 00:32:59,188
Yeah.

656
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,347
I heard he has booked an air ticket.

657
00:33:01,828 --> 00:33:03,467
I'm ready to say goodbye.

658
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:09,828
Come to the bar tonight.

659
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:12,347
It's time to say goodbye.

660
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:14,788
There will be a farewell party tonight.

661
00:34:05,028 --> 00:34:05,747
What is this?

662
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:07,227
A parting gift for me?

663
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:11,668
Sort of.

664
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:14,387
A parting gift to singleness.

665
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,747
Well, I'll have to think about it.

666
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,188
I'm still enjoying my single life.

667
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:24,387
How long are you going to enjoy it?

668
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:28,507
Until you come back.

669
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:30,548
How long?

670
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:34,107
Maybe... three years?

671
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:38,107
Or maybe... one month?

672
00:34:58,267 --> 00:34:59,267
Xu Qingyou.

673
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:01,668
For so many years,

674
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,107
I've been looking for an ideal love.

675
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,948
But no one has ever touched me

676
00:35:08,948 --> 00:35:11,588
like you at the beginning.

677
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:14,548
The world is so big.

678
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:16,867
Luckily I met you.

679
00:35:22,107 --> 00:35:23,068
I won't

680
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,627
get lost again.

681
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:31,788
Xu Qingyou.

682
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:34,828
Will you marry me?

683
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:49,148
Of course.

684
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:20,240
(The End)
