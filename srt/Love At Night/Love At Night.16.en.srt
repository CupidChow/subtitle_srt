3
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,239
Help, Lingze!

4
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,239
Help, Lingze!

5
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,440
Help!

6
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,040
Lin Siyu.

7
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,800
What's wrong with you?

8
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,120
My leg hurts.

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,360
I was bitten by an insect.

10
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,599
It seemed to be poisonous.

11
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,559
It's not serious.

12
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:51,919
Let's go to the infirmary.

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,919
It was Wang Ji who told you we are here?

14
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,440
Wang Ji?

15
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,160
Is Wang Ji here, too?

16
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,240
Watch out.

17
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,160
Are you okay?

18
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,639
For God's sake,

19
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,080
your leg was still injured.

20
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:23,919
Why did you insist on coming?

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,679
I just spent a little time paying the taxi,

22
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,759
how could you get injured again?

23
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,479
Let's go.

24
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,720
Come on. Find a place to stay.

25
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,360
I won't go.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,520
Wang Ji, take her away.

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,759
Let's go.

28
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,000
Find a place to have a rest.

29
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:35,559
Come on.

30
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,240
No!

31
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,240
Come on.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,800
I...

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,839
I don't want to leave.

34
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,199
Lingze, look at me!

35
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,399
I'm painful.

36
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,880
Mr. Mo is really charming.

37
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,759
Girls are coming here for you.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,720
Director Xu is also ready to release charm

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,839
to attract other men.

40
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,559
Thanks.

41
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,720
My pleasure.

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,039
Honey,

43
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,399
I saw a bag in a boutique the other day

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,199
that was particularly nice.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,919
How was the year?

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,839
Pretty good.

47
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,880
Let's go there together.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,520
Sit there.

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
Long time no see.

50
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,039
You're prettier.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,839
It's a deal.

52
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,600
(Xu Wei)
Where are you? Why haven't you arrived yet?

53
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,160
Fang.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,479
Why didn't you come with your boyfriend?

55
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,199
You have a boyfriend?

56
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,360
When?

57
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,479
Fang hasn't made it public?

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,440
That's why you don't want to take him here?

59
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,639
When it comes to relationship,

60
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,759
you should change some of your temper.

61
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,919
Don't push your boyfriend too hard.

62
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,759
And don't be too fastidious.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,759
Otherwise,

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
even a good man can't stand you.

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,240
It's because I don't want to control him

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,960
that I don't take him everywhere.

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,679
Qu Kai doesn't think so.

68
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,880
He

69
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
is the most considerate person I have ever seen.

70
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
He was worried that I was being left out.

71
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,040
By the way,

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,359
this

73
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,200
is the engagement ring

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,359
he bought for me in Singapore in particular.

75
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,480
Sis, do you think it looks good?

76
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,559
So sparkling.

77
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:38,839
So big.

78
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,200
Excuse me,

79
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm late.

80
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,760
I'm Xu Wei,

81
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,040
Fang Qi's boyfriend.

82
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,519
Good for you.

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,119
How did you hook such a handsome guy?

84
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,799
I took the bait myself.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,720
Here. A surprise for you.

86
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,760
So romantic.

87
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm going to have a boyfriend like that one day.

88
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,480
Artists are different,

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,399
they don't give anything corny.

90
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,720
Of course.

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Nothing surprise.

92
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,200
Custom paintings are now available online.

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,920
Nothing special.

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,279
It's easy to buy a custom painting.

95
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,959
But painting a portrait of a loved one by hand

96
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,839
is not for everyone.

97
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,880
Nice painting.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,519
Pass me that plate.

99
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,160
Okay, here you are.

100
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,559
Pang, go and fetch some barbecue.

101
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,239
What do you want? I'm going to make some barbecue.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,559
Let me know what you want.

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,239
I want chicken wings

104
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
-and Fish Tofu. -Okay, okay.

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,359
Director Xu really does

106
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,880
think of others in everything,

107
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,519
even forgetting about yourself.

108
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,880
Isn't that what you expected?

109
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,679
Do you really think you know me?

110
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,279
Xiao Mei, I want a sausage.

111
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,760
And this ham sausage.

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Lingze.

113
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,720
Have you roasted my favorite chicken wings?

114
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,920
I roast anything recommended by a friend.

115
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,320
You want me to try something new, right?

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,160
Considerate.

117
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,920
Love that.

118
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:52,119
Cheers!

119
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,640
Let's take a picture together.

120
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,160
Okay. Come on.

121
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,320
Come on. Take a picture.

122
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
Come on and take a photo.

123
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,279
Go go go.

124
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,200
Hurry up.

125
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,559
Okay. Come here.

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,359
Here.

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,200
Director Xu, come and take a picture.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
The kitchen killer.

129
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,079
I bet you can't survive without takeaways.

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,079
Come with me.

131
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:14,799
No.

132
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
I can handle it.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
Come on. I'll say one two three.

134
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,279
Then we say cheese together.

135
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,640
Okay.

136
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,799
One two three. Cheese.

137
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,359
Flush with cool water for at least 15 minutes

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,359
to effectively avoid pain and swelling.

139
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,079
Okay. Got it.

140
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,880
Go back. They are waiting for you.

141
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,519
Director Xu, do you really think

142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,239
I'm a Fast Fooder for relationships?

143
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,320
Okay.

144
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,359
Qingyou, is everything okay with your hand?

145
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,359
Okay.

146
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,239
I can handle it.

147
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:07,760
Let me see.

148
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,799
Don't worry.

149
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:10,880
Luckily, it's nothing serious.

150
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,480
Make Lingze

151
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,399
do these things.

152
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,399
He can do anything.

153
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,200
I'm going to win Lingze's heart tonight.

154
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,600
What kind of makeup should I wear?

155
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,119
Siyu.

156
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,559
Some people,

157
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
who appear to be gentle,

158
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,880
will actually play with people's feelings.

159
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,599
You'd better be careful.

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,679
Lingze isn't that kind of person.

161
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,960
He is the one

162
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,640
with an attractive face,

163
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,880
but he's very celibate.

164
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
He is celibate?

165
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,119
Do you forget

166
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,479
he has a book full of girlfriends?

167
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,320
That's a joking made by the band.

168
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
I even wrote something on it.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,559
Let's go back to that game.

170
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,039
Okay.

171
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,400
Qu Kai likes cats or dogs?

172
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,159
Dogs.

173
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,919
What hobbies does Fang Qi have?

174
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,880
Boxing.

175
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,840
What color does Liang Yinyin like?

176
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,799
Pink.

177
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,359
Does Xu Wei like boxing?

178
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,119
Of course.

179
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,599
How did these two couples get into the competition?

180
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,960
Can we still play this game?

181
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,039
Stop talking.

182
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,200
What's Liang Yinyin's favorite food?

183
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,359
-Marinated pork trotters. -Metapenaeus ensis.

184
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,159
You...

185
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,719
How many times did Fang 
go to the amusement park last year?

186
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,640
Xu Wei was still in Paris last year.

187
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,039
He doesn't know the answer.

188
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,840
Then you're throwing in the towel.

189
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,239
Eight times.

190
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,400
She only goes to the haunted house
at the amusement park

191
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,880
when she is unhappy.

192
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,640
Even though I was not in the country,

193
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,359
whenever I saw her tweeting about haunted houses,

194
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,599
I would find a way to make her laugh.

195
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,479
He even knows that.

196
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,039
The outcome of the game was in no doubt.

197
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,840
Those questions were easy.

198
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,320
How many boyfriends did Fang make after divorcing?

199
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
It's just a game.

200
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,640
Don't go overboard.

201
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,799
If you dare to play, you must take the consequence.

202
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,599
No matter what has happened in the past,

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,719
it will not affect my love for Fang Qi

204
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,719
now and in the future.

205
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,359
And I should thank Qu Kai

206
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,679
for remembering Fang Qi likes metapenaeus ensis most.

207
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
I always cook her that now.

208
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,559
Come on. Have a drink.

209
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,840
Come on. Cheers, cheers.

210
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,479
Cheers.

211
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,440
Fang Qi.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,200
Yinyin is too young.

214
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,760
She always wants to surpass you.

215
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,640
It's all over.

216
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,960
We were also like this before.

217
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,320
Wish you happiness.

218
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,919
Thanks.

219
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,119
You two really have a tacit agreement.

220
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,799
Nonsense.

221
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,200
I admired

222
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,080
him before

223
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,039
and thought he was all-powerful.

224
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,919
Now that I grew up a lot,

225
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,159
he doesn't have a halo to me at all.

226
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,880
Your job is done.

227
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,200
Go home.

228
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,760
You just dump me like this?

229
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

230
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,080
Since I've done you a favor,

231
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,919
you should also promise me a condition.

232
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,239
What?

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,520
Come on.

234
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,919
Go.

235
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,880
Now let's play

236
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,760
the live action role playing (LARP) games.

237
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,919
We play an ancient costume version today.

238
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,159
It's Peach Blossom Banquet.

239
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,119
Though it's an ancient costume version,

240
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,200
we don't need to change our clothes today.

241
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,000
Please be familiar with your role

242
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,599
and your plots.

243
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,479
Okay.

244
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,479
Now that we know who the murder is.

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,840
We will then

246
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,440
restore the scene of the crime.

247
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,479
Restoration?

248
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:34,919
Is there this process?

249
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,280
-Our game should be done. -Yeah.

250
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,960
-There are many snacks we haven't had. -Yeah.

251
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,479
Yes. Yes, we have.

252
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,200
The script shows that

253
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,280
I make my confession to this gentleman.

254
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,119
But I don't get his response.

255
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:50,919
Then I kiss him

256
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,280
for a long time.

257
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,799
Then I hear someone fall to the ground next door.

258
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,960
So

259
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,239
let's start the play before the fall.

260
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,280
It means that you have to kiss.

261
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:11,359
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

262
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,159
Kiss, kiss.

263
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,280
Hello?

264
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,280
Answer the email, right?

265
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,640
Sorry, sorry. I'll answer it right now.

266
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,840
I get something to do and I'm gonna go.

267
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,440
Goodbye.

268
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,679
Right now.

269
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,960
How about in three minutes?

270
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,679
Okay.

271
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,200
Okay.

272
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,200
What's wrong with Qingyu?

273
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,239
Go on.

274
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,400
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

275
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,280
I have something to do, too

276
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,320
Have fun.

277
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,159
Let's eat, everybody. It's getting cold.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,960
I want this. I want this.

279
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,640
Why are you nervous, Xu Qingyu?

280
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,599
It's none of your business.

281
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,640
Didn't you say you had an email to deal with?

282
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,440
So what?

283
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,880
Am I interfering with your game?

284
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,880
Do you think I really want to play that?

285
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:38,799
You are hard to guess,

286
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,799
and I don't want to guess.

287
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,880
Then I tell you directly.

288
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,440
There's no prudish white-collar woman.

289
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,320
There's no roster of girlfriends.

290
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,119
There's no chance of that kiss from the game.

291
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,159
Why do you tell me?

292
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,239
It's none of my business.

293
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,960
It's your business.

294
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,559
I like one person.

295
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:08,799
And

296
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,359
she knows that.

297
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,559
And I know

298
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,359
that she cares about me a lot.

299
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,799
She's sad for me,

300
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,159
angry for me,

301
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,479
jealous for me,

302
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,200
and worried for me.

303
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,799
If that's not love,

304
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,919
what would it be?

305
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,680
I want to tell you a secret.

306
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,111
I tend to put on my air of arrogance
in the face of someone I dislike.

307
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,599
But if one day you find out

308
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:19,880
that I am talkative,

309
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,239
cute,

310
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,719
possessive,

311
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,359
and even a little suspicious,

312
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,800
that means I love this guy terribly.

313
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,359
But Qu Kai,

314
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,560
he can't understand me.

315
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,959
That's why I sentenced him to death.

316
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm not asking you to drink with me today,

317
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,520
I just want to use this way

318
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,199
to help you get all the depression out of your heart.

319
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,760
However,

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,479
today, after seeing Qu Kai and Liang Yinyin stay together,

321
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
I suddenly understand

322
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,079
I'm always the right answer.

323
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,599
But he takes the wrong test paper.

324
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,079
I just got over it.

325
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
I let it go.

326
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
In fact, from now on,

327
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,599
I can understand more and more

328
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,520
how you feel about Qu Kai.

329
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,160
Understand? Understand.

330
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,280
You were crying on the doorstep

331
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,199
when you got divorced.

332
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,719
I saw it when I was heading home from school.

333
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,479
In fact, I know all your embarrassing past.

334
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
But I don't care.

335
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,319
Why do you say that?

336
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,119
The questions you answered

337
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,959
during the meal just now clearly indicated

338
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,000
that you used to secretly observe me.

339
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,199
Are you interested in me?

340
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,280
Yeah.

341
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm attracted by you.

342
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,160
Fang Qi.

343
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,239
I like you.

344
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,239
Did you hear me?

345
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,599
Too noisy.

346
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,599
Mo Lingze.

347
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,839
If you still don't want me,

348
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,000
I won't pursue you anymore

349
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,000
and never be back.

350
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,520
Why nobody is here?

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,760
Does your hand still hurt?

352
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,880
It's just a small burn.

353
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
How can I be that delicate?

354
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:06,800
Right.

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
Director Xu is tough

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,160
and very patient.

357
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,839
Not as patient as you.

358
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,599
Your jealous look

359
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:26,880
is cute.

360
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,040
I haven't been jealous.

361
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,280
Who stopped the game just now?

362
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,280
It's me.

363
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,719
But I did this for the role.

364
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,000
I didn't expect Director Xu was quite into the scene.

365
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Not as into it as you were.

366
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,959
Didn't you also use this game

367
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,359
to set the record straight about your roster?

368
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,119
Stop.

369
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,800
I just don't want to get more nicknames.

370
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,640
Poker Face.

371
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,040
Steel Wire.

372
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,119
Philatelic Man.

373
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,359
Fast Fooder.

374
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,000
The stars are really beautiful tonight.

375
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,719
The suburb lives up to its name.

376
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,479
The meteor shower is coming.

377
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,319
I'm not a teenage girl

378
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,119
who makes wishes on shooting stars anymore.

379
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,239
A star for you.

380
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,479
It's not for a teenage girl.

381
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,760
I didn't say yes.

382
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:57,959
Xu Qingyou.

383
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,719
Do you still want to hide?

384
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:07,800
No, I don't.

385
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,520
I can't hide from you.

386
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,239
Xu Qingyou, Xu Qingyou.

387
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,319
Impulse is the devil.

388
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,760
How could I be in the charge of the devil?

389
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:34,719
Morning.

390
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:40,880
Morning.

391
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:44,599
No more sleep?

392
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,839
No need.

393
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm thirsty.

394
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,719
Can you get me a glass of water?

395
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,680
You don't want to regret it, do you?

396
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,719
No, I don't.

397
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm not that kind of person.

398
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:08,560
Great.

399
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,719
Qingyou,

400
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,560
open the door.

401
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,959
Qingyou, Qingyou.

402
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,520
What are you doing?

403
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,119
Make our relationship public.

404
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:29,880
No, you can't.

405
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,280
What do you mean, Director Xu?

406
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,880
Am I that unpresentable?

407
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,640
No.

408
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,119
One trouble is better than two.

409
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,239
And I don't know how to explain it to her.

410
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,319
Explain?

411
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,599
Explain what?

412
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,119
Waitress,

413
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,359
please open the door.

414
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,079
My friend lives there.

415
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,760
I'm worried about her.

416
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,119
I'm sorry for you.

417
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,000
What are you doing?

418
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,239
-Please, please. -I refuse.

419
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,280
I will make it up to you later.

420
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,560
Lady,

421
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,760
if you want to open the door,

422
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,000
please contact reception.

423
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Why can't you tell them?

424
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,239
Shush. Qingyou, open the door.

425
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,359
Big news.

426
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,839
Don't do this again.

427
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,599
Qingyou.

428
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:19,719
Coming.

429
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,439
Qingyou, open the door.

430
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,560
Open the door.

431
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,599
-Siyu. -Why do you just open the door?

432
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I thought you were in trouble.

433
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,319
I'm an adult,

434
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,359
what could happen to me?

435
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,160
Lots of things.

436
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,359
Haven't you seen the news?

437
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,479
There are many people living alone

438
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,760
who have been found in accidents in their homes.

439
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,000
And no one finds that for many days. 
How dangerous!

440
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,319
You care too much about me.

441
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,560
Why are you coming here so early?

442
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,680
Big news.

443
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,560
Lingze disappears.

444
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,839
Mr. Mo disappears?

445
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,079
I couldn't find him anywhere.

446
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,119
Have you seen him?

447
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,040
No.

448
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:07,520
He didn't come back the whole night.

449
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,119
Really?

450
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,800
Where does he go?

451
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:15,359
Yeah. Where?

452
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,400
I have a bad feeling about this.

453
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,719
What's that sound?

454
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,079
It must be a waiter.

455
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,319
By the way, how's your leg?

456
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:25,959
Still hurts?

457
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,400
Qingyou.

458
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,079
Lingze is so charming.

459
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,760
Do you think he is seduced by a siren?

460
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,880
No way.

461
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,439
Don't worry.

462
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,839
I'm still in a panic.

463
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,119
I have to call him.

464
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,359
Hello, the number you dialed is busy now.

465
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,800
Please redial later.

466
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,000
Alright.

467
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,560
I'm choking.

468
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm right.

469
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,199
What's wrong?

470
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,079
He hung up on me.

471
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,280
He really has an accident.

472
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,599
Hello, Wang Ji.

473
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,839
You have found Lingze.

474
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:13,800
Where is he?

475
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:15,760
I'm coming right now.

476
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,599
Keep an eye on him for me!

477
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,400
Be careful of your leg.

478
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,439
The leg doesn't matter now.

479
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,560
Find him first.

480
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,119
Director Xu, we've done this

481
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,680
and you still want to deny it?

482
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,959
What am I supposed to say?

483
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,040
I couldn't tell Lin Siyu

484
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,520
that I was the siren, could I?

485
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:44,719
Our relationship

486
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,839
doesn't need other's definitions.

487
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:51,400
There is an industry wine event next week.

488
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,599
Come with me.

489
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,599
Inappropriate.

490
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:02,599
You're the most famous gold investor in Shangger.

491
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,599
I'm a little Director.

492
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,000
It's weird if we go there together.

493
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,040
You are flattering me again.

494
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm not flattering you.

495
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,119
I'm serious.

496
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,479
Think it through before you answer me.

497
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,680
Xu Wei.

498
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,479
You wake up.

499
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,160
I made you honey water to

500
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,839
sober you up.

501
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,040
I've made the breakfast.

502
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,560
You can eat after washing up.

503
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,920
Though I don't know what's wrong with you,

504
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,280
your cooking skill is good.

505
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,119
It's the first day we are together.

506
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,680
It has to be a bit of a ritual.

507
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,239
I make you feel a special kind of happiness

508
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,800
every time you think of this day.

509
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:10,680
What's more,

510
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,520
every year on this day,

511
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,479
I will prepare a different surprise for you.

512
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,439
Don't worry,

513
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,160
I promise

514
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,400
that I will be good to you every day from now on.

515
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,160
You don't have a fever, so what's this nonsense?

516
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,719
What do you mean the first day and every day.

517
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,199
When have I been with you?

518
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,199
What?

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,040
You forget?

520
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,040
It just happened last night.

521
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,319
You forget it all?

522
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,119
It was there last night.

523
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:38,719
Oh my.

524
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,239
Just here.

525
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,439
It was here last night.

526
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,280
When we sat there,

527
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,319
you suddenly pushed...

528
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,959
Stop.

529
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,400
Remember?

530
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,040
I have only one sentence to say

531
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,839
about my behavior last night.

532
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,160
I've lost my virtue after drinking.

533
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,520
I have no comment on the rest.
