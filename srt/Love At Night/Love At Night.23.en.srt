00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,200
(Judges of Post competition of Lemi 2021
Special judge: Mo Lingze)

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,599
See?

5
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,040
Meng, here is the list of judges.

6
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,839
Take a look.

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,559
There's Qingyou.

8
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,559
Let's go talk to her.

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,480
Qingyou.

10
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,199
Have you seen the list of judges?

11
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,040
Mr. Mo is on it.

12
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:56,919
Really?

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
Thank God.

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,440
Qingyou can finally get a promotion!

15
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,599
Not necessarily.

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,639
Why not?

17
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,040
Mr. Mo takes such care of you

18
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,400
and he will definitely give you high marks.

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,479
Besides,

20
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,039
with your strength,

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,559
isn't it easy to win

22
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,759
those external judges?

23
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,639
Right, Dapang?

24
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,399
Of course.

25
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,199
In this competition,

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,039
we are all nonstriker.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,199
Qingyou.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,759
It's really enviable that

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
Mr. Mo is your patron.

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,679
Don't be stupid, you guys.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,240
Qingyou will be promoted in the future,

32
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,800
how can she remember you?

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,279
You help her move up now,

34
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,520
but don't regret it later.

35
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,800
Long Jin.

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,240
Regardless of whether I have strings,

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,520
even if there are,

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,160
it is also a kind of ability.

39
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,279
Since you're so eager for strings,

40
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,679
why not try it yourself.

41
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,039
Here's a word for you.

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,240
When eight immortals crossed the sea,

43
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,759
each showed their own magic.

44
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,839
Goodbye, Director Long.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,559
Byebye.

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,260
(Game Over)

47
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,460
(Lose)

48
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,360
(Win)

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
What's the point of winning a game?

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,479
It's all talk on paper.

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,399
I didn't take it seriously before,

52
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,759
so that you can win so fast.

53
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,080
I won't be polite this time.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,839
It turns out that the Xu family's style is quarrelsome.

55
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

56
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,359
Throw in the towel?

57
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,799
The Xu family's style

58
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,799
is never give up.

59
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,720
This is not boxing.

60
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:56,640
It's...

61
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,160
It's not even wrestling.

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,880
Release!

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,399
Whatever it takes to beat you.

64
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,480
Release me!

65
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,279
Unless you say I win.

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,279
Release!

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,519
No way.

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
Today I'm in a bad state.

69
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,679
Next time I'll find a good day

70
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,720
and beat you to the ground.

71
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,000
Go ahead.

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,640
What are you up to

73
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,720
with all this?

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,679
Of course it's to help my sister.

75
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
This is to tell you that

76
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm her backer,

77
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,119
and you can't bully her.

78
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,640
Who could bully her?

79
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,679
Your ex.

80
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,359
Fang Qi told me all about it.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,279
My sister

82
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
has a hard tongue and a soft heart,

83
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,640
and she always takes it on her own.

84
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,480
Mr. Mo.

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,440
You'd better not make her sad.

86
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,799
I'm quite envious of Xu Qingyou now.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,040
She has the friend who defends her

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,000
and the brother who protects her.

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,320
So I'm warning you,

90
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,519
if your ex

91
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,959
comes to harass my sister again,

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,399
we two will definitely deal with you in mixed doubles.

93
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,160
Don't worry.

94
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
You're not gonna get the chance.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,519
OK.

96
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,959
That's what I want to hear from you.

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,880
I'm tired to death

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,640
after all this battle.

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,799
I must ask her for reward when I go back.

100
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,559
Don't harass her.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Mr. Mo.

102
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,720
You are so good at playing games.

103
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,640
Is there any trick?

104
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,679
Want it?

105
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,640
Maybe, you can call me something else.

106
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,119
Brother-in-law?

107
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,160
Yes.

108
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,519
It's a pretty good trick.

109
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,679
Brother- in- law was not called in vain.

110
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,640
Just good luck.

111
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,679
One more game.

112
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,679
Wait, wait.

113
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,279
I'm going camping with my classmates tomorrow.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,079
How about you go with me?

115
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,119
I have no time.

116
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,559
Isn't tomorrow the weekend?

117
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,119
I have to work on weekends, too.

118
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,160
I've made a few mistakes lately.

119
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,720
Although Poker Face didn't say anything,

120
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,040
in front of the leaders...

121
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,119
They bring girlfriends every year,

122
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,559
but I don't have one.

123
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,000
I finally have you this year.

124
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,880
And I've made a big promise.

125
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,279
I'll lose face

126
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,000
if you don't go with me.

127
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,239
Fine, fine, fine.

128
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,040
I'll do it.

129
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,920
Really?

130
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,440
I know you care about me.

131
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,640
But,

132
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,679
I have one condition.

133
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,679
I'll give you whatever you want.

134
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,519
Give me the trick.

135
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,200
That's easy.

136
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,000
You're so happy.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,320
Why are you smiling at me?

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,239
The elder sister pays off the younger brother's debts.

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,039
It's worth it.

140
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,080
Xu Wei,

141
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,159
this month's pocket money,

142
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,359
and next month's pocket money is off the table.

143
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,760
I heard that

144
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,919
someone has made you wronged.

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,080
No, I haven't been wronged.

146
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,479
Three months are too long.

147
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,159
I want to change my mind.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,640
Mr. Mo.

149
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,479
Are you worried that

150
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,640
your particularly powerful ex

151
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,520
will bully me

152
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,000
and want her to quit?

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Let me tell you.

154
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,880
I don't care whether she quits or not.

155
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
What I care about is
that you are an external judge now.

156
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,080
If we make it public now,

157
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,479
others will stab me in the back.

158
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,039
Director Xu.

159
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,760
Is there nothing else on your mind

160
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,479
except the competition?

161
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,280
That's right.

162
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,119
So please stay away from me.

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,719
I don't want any gossip.

164
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm gonna run for the position myself

165
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,080
and shut them up.

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,840
Since Director Xu is so determined to win,

167
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,840
I will support you

168
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,080
regardless of success or failure.

169
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,000
Thanks.

170
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,719
Thank you.

171
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,799
Just thank me like this?

172
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,840
(Mom invites you to a video call)

173
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,760
A call.

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,520
Wait a moment.

175
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,919
It's my mother.

176
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,119
Hello, mum.

177
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,960
Youyou, what are you doing now?

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,919
Are you going to bed?

179
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,679
Not yet.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,799
What's wrong?

181
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,799
Can't I just talk to you?

182
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,280
OK, OK, OK.

183
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,880
What's up?

184
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,119
Youyou.

185
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,960
Why do I see the furniture in the room

186
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,520
is different from last time?

187
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,679
I've been

188
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,000
taking a lot of time off recently,

189
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:45,760
so,

190
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,479
I just rearranged it.

191
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,919
I've never seen you work so hard at home before.

192
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,760
I've been working really hard, okay?

193
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,520
All right.

194
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,159
Why is your face a little red?

195
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,479
Have you not eaten well recently?

196
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,679
I tell you

197
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,479
that

198
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,880
don't eat take-out too often.

199
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,359
When you get home from work early,

200
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,159
you can buy some vegetables and make some soup,

201
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:12,880
do you hear me?

202
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,960
Take care of yourself!

203
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:16,719
Got it.

204
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,400
Don't worry.

205
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,679
I have a meeting tomorrow,

206
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,039
so let's stop here.

207
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,799
Remember to go to bed early.

208
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,719
Good night.

209
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,080
Are you crazy?

210
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,200
My mom calls to check on me,

211
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,119
and you just mess around.

212
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,960
What a pity.

213
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,200
I should have said hello to your mum.

214
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,119
Sooner or later, I'll give you the chance.

215
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,159
Accompany me to cook,

216
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,039
where are you going?

217
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,359
Coming.

218
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,280
It smells good.

219
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:51,919
Of course.

220
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Does this need to be cut into fine strips?

221
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,039
Let me do it.

222
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,840
OK.

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,479
Xu Wei.

224
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,559
We almost set up the tent.

225
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,239
Why doesn't your girlfriend show up?

226
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,119
She has something to do.

227
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,200
Xu Wei.

228
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,039
Where does your girlfriend work?

229
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,080
What's her job?

230
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,640
She's in the business of investing.

231
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,440
Investing?

232
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,479
You won't understand it.

233
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,080
No, thanks.

234
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,960
Her major is so far behind ours.

235
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,400
How did you meet?

236
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,239
Don't be curious.

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,679
They are childhood sweethearts.

238
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:04,960
Who is this beautiful woman?

239
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,400
This bike is so stylish.

240
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,159
She is beautiful.

241
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,559
Hello, Qi.

242
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,159
Hello, everybody.

243
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm Xu Wei's girlfriend.

244
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,960
Qi, just help yourself.

245
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,719
I'll tell them to grill more skewers later.

246
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:02,919
Ahem,

247
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,640
you made a hairstyle

248
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,599
to meet my friends?

249
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,880
No.

250
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,039
I just had a full face makeover.

251
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,400
Coming.

252
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,559
First time out with you,

253
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,679
I can't embarrass you.

254
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,799
Xu Wei.

255
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
I never thought you born to be single,

256
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,440
but your first love was such a domineering lady.

257
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,640
That's right, Wei.

258
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,679
Your girlfriend has a lot of charisma.

259
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,520
What should we call you?

260
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,359
You can just call me Qi.

261
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:30,719
Qi.

262
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,559
After all, I'm seven or eight years older than you.

263
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,799
Seven or eight years?

264
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,280
So are you in your thirties?

265
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
What are you laughing at?

266
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know who told me that

267
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,960
they were childhood sweethearts.

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,239
I grew up with Xu Wei's sister.

269
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,840
I witnessed Xu Wei's growth.

270
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,239
Xu Wei has been...

271
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:51,760
No, no.

272
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,239
Eat.

273
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,760
Come on.

274
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,479
Let's have a drink.

275
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:55,960
Come on.

276
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,080
That's great.

277
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,559
Thank Qi for saving Xu Wei.

278
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:00,919
Thank you, Qi.

279
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,559
Not at all.

280
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,479
Qi.

281
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,280
You can be together

282
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,119
with such a difference in age.

283
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,679
You must have a lot of topics in common, right?

284
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,520
Not much, it seems.

285
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,559
Did you all watch the game yesterday?

286
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,559
Sure.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,559
I tell you

288
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,599
that Mbappé,

289
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,719
Electric motor,

290
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,559
Ninja Turtles,

291
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,359
the speed

292
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,039
is fantastic.

293
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,880
He got a red card yesterday

294
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,640
and he's still unstable.

295
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,479
He is still too young.

296
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,039
This is not a problem

297
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,479
for a veteran player like Messi.

298
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,000
(Information about Mbappé)

299
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,080
(Information about Mbappé)
That depends.

300
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,599
Qi.

301
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,719
You must know a lot about the football.

302
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,880
I watch it more or less,

303
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,320
but

304
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,840
I like Mbappé very much.

305
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,280
Do you think he can overtake Messi?

306
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,280
He's only in his twenties,

307
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,119
and he is really going places.

308
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,640
Qi, my bosom friend!

309
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,359
Come on.

310
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,960
That's right, Qi. Come on.

311
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,760
What's wrong?

312
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,239
Young people like to be alone.

313
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
Just give them some privacy.

314
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,080
Let's enjoy ourselves.

315
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Cheer up.

316
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,239
Where is Mr. Zhai 's office, please?

317
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,200
Go forward and turn left.

318
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,880
OK, thank you.

319
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,760
If 10 is a perfect score,

320
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,000
Miss Xu is beautiful,

321
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,000
so your appearance is 8.1 points.

322
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,400
As for the IQ,

323
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,559
5 points.

324
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,799
EQ is 4.5 points

325
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,880
As for shrewdness,

326
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,439
3 points.

327
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,400
Round it off,

328
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,640
Miss Xu hasn't passed yet.

329
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,239
I just want to know

330
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,599
why would Mo Lingze fall for

331
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,000
a woman like you?

332
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,920
Xu Qingyou.

333
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,400
Your score...

334
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,959
Your score is not defined by others.

335
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:30,920
Hi, everyone.

336
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,359
I'm Xu Qingyou,

337
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,079
a director of Lemi commerce operation.

338
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
Over the past year,

339
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,719
I've plotted Meeting Your Match,

340
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,640
and signed the popular live streamer Lyuluo,

341
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,479
which provide strong support

342
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,400
for the future development of Lemi.

343
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,079
The reason why I have the courage

344
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,359
to participate in the job competition here

345
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,560
is because I have the following advantages.

346
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,640
I wish I could get more opportunities.

347
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,199
So that's all.

348
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,079
Thank you.

349
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,400
What's up?

350
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,040
Xu Wei.

351
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,719
What are you doing being a kid?

352
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,959
I don't like you like that.

353
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,239
What's wrong with me?

354
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,880
If you don't watch the game,

355
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,280
why do you have to make changes

356
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,119
to cater to them?

357
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,040
Aren't they all your friends?

358
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:39,839
No.

359
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,959
You are the one I love most.

360
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,119
If they don't respect you,

361
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,560
they're not my friends.

362
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't say such angry words.

363
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,199
Friendship and love are the same.

364
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,560
Don't give up lightly,

365
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,199
or you will regret it.

366
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,640
But,

367
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,439
I don't want you to be wronged because of me.

368
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,239
I have no grievance.

369
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm very happy as long as I'm with you.

370
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,199
You used to pay for me,

371
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:07,920
and change for me.

372
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,959
So it's okay for me to make some changes.

373
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,160
But what I want you to do

374
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,839
is something other than this.

375
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,400
I don't want you to change your appearance
because of me,

376
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,880
and I don't want you

377
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,680
to do housework that you are not good at

378
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,479
or like,

379
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,000
and I don't want you

380
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,640
to forget to express yourself

381
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,560
in order to blend in with their preferences.

382
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,160
If that's the case,

383
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,920
you can do nothing,

384
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,000
or even not come in the beginning.

385
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,479
Can you stop talking such angry words?

386
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,400
This is not angry words,

387
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,640
this is the truth.

388
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,520
I just like Fang Qi

389
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,400
who refuses if she doesn't want to,

390
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,920
curses when she is unhappy,

391
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,680
cries when she want to cry,

392
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,479
laughs when she want to laugh,

393
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,880
the most authentic

394
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,400
and sincere Fang Qi.

395
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,199
Because Fang Qi like that

396
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,439
has light in her eyes.

397
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,920
Last June 18,

398
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,760
adopting amateurs as models

399
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,560
to complete the theme plan
for letting the world accept you

400
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,640
is Director Xu's bold attempt, right?

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,599
Someone once pointed out the risks involved,

402
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,239
but you didn't adopt his opinion.

403
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,800
In the end,

404
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,599
the project ended in a raging public opinion,

405
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,079
and the private life of one of the amateurs was exposed

406
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,479
and suffered extreme cyber violence.

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,760
What I'm asking is

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,719
if you had the chance to do it again

409
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,400
would you continue to

410
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,479
push forward this plan?

411
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,079
Yes,

412
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,079
I would still choose this plan.

413
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,079
Because it propagates the concept of

414
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,319
accepting the imperfect self.

415
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,800
If it's not a real attitude

416
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,400
to begin with,

417
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,400
how can it

418
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,520
have a real effect?

419
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Reflecting on that mistake,

420
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,400
I really feel ashamed.

421
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,280
First,

422
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,880
I feel sorry for my amateur.

423
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,239
I didn't protect him.

424
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,280
Second,

425
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,599
I feel sorry for my company.

426
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,880
It was my negligence.

427
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,079
If I can have another chance,

428
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,000
I will definitely think of a plan

429
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,479
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

430
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,520
Director Xu.

431
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,640
On the basis of accomplishing the company's benefits,

432
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,719
it's understandable to spread the correct values.

433
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,599
But if you spread

434
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,359
at the expense of the company,

435
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,479
then

436
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,920
you are not a qualified employee.

437
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,719
You know what?

438
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,839
Qingyou lost.

439
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:03,800
What?

440
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,599
Keep it down.

441
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,199
They didn't pick Qingyou?

442
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,599
Yes.

443
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,160
I really don't know

444
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,920
what Mr. Mo is thinking.

445
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,239
Qingyou is so talented,

446
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,040
why...

447
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:16,640
No, no, no.

448
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,359
The result is important,

449
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,760
but as long as you work hard in the process,

450
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,680
you have a clear conscience.

451
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,719
Are you guys not doing your job,

452
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,800
just slacking off?

453
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,280
Go, go, go.

454
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,040
You worked so hard to please Mr. Mo,

455
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,719
but still failed.

456
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,839
This isn't a long-term solution, Director Xu.

457
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,439
Director Long.

458
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,479
Are you so idle?

459
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,640
It seems you've been trying to please leaders.

460
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,800
I was just trying it out for you.

461
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,599
You're a great talker,

462
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,199
but you still didn't get in.

463
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,239
Poverty gives rise to the desire for change.

464
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,599
Someone

465
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,599
might lose his current position, right?

466
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm in a bad mood.

467
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,000
Come and have lunch with me.

468
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,830
(Mo Lingze)

469
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,880
Fine, fine.

470
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Are you still not used to Poker Face's style?

471
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
He is a hard rock.

472
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,640
What are you sulking about?

473
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,839
Who said I cared about him?

474
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:47,880
Mainly because

475
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
I didn't think I was performing well.

476
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,599
You don't think

477
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,880
you lost to Tang Xi, do you?

478
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,800
I don't know who told me that

479
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,400
ex is the past,

480
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,520
and there's nothing to be afraid of.

481
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,760
Who said I lost to Tang Xi?

482
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,239
I just think

483
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm a business loser

484
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,599
in Poker Face's heart.

485
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,680
Can you relax a little bit?

486
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,520
Falling in love is not looking for a job.

487
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,319
Why are you obsessed with the one
who has strong business ability?

488
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,599
If it's like you said,

489
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,839
Poker Face and Mr. Han are evenly matched.

490
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,319
Why aren't they together yet?

491
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,079
Wipe it.

492
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,239
All right.

493
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,239
I didn't know

494
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,680
the traitor was right next to me.

495
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,719
Stop losing your temper

496
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:55,920
and make it clear.

497
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm going now.

498
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:15,959
If you want to get angry,

499
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,640
you have to eat

500
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,280
and build up your strength.

501
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,880
The right ingredients

502
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,599
with the right seasonings

503
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,719
can inspire maximum flavor.

504
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,400
You lose the election

505
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
not because of your ability,

506
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,599
but because of your position.

507
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,880
Get mad at me,

508
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,640
don't waste salt.

509
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,040
Mr. Mo.

510
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,119
Every word you just said

511
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:00,040
is salt in my wound.

512
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,959
What I need now is a boyfriend,

513
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,680
the comfort of a boyfriend,

514
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,319
not your analysis.

515
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,400
Director Xu should think clearly.

516
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,079
You are so stubborn now,

517
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,719
and if one day you want to apologize,

518
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,280
don't be embarrassed.

519
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,239
Who'd like to apologize to you?

520
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,079
Mr. Mo, don't think too much.

521
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:29,880
Hello, Sir.

522
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,880
Hello, I have an appointment.

523
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:41,079
Although you lost this competition,

524
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,319
the jury really

525
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,439
approved of you.

526
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,079
You settled Lyuluo's affairs

527
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,400
and signed Ah Qiao.

528
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:50,959
I think

529
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,839
you have the ability to be an live streamer operator

530
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,920
and manager.

531
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:57,479
The company has just set up
a business development department,

532
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,640
so you're the best person to take charge of it.

533
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,280
Mr. Mo also said that

534
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,760
this track is more suitable for you.

535
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,079
Don't hesitate.

536
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,479
Mr. Mo?

537
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,239
Thanks to your discretion,

538
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,319
we didn't get caught up in the Taikang fraud,

539
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,040
which saved Shangger's losses.

540
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:18,719
Mr. Luo.

541
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,880
There aren't idle people in the company.

542
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,079
Just come straight to the point.

543
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,319
Actually, I quest you today

544
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,000
for another big event.

545
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,040
The Hua group merger case

546
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,239
finally has a breakthrough.

547
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,760
The relationship between Mrs. Hua,

548
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,199
a major shareholder, and her son is deadlocked.

549
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,160
If we can handle her son,

550
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,079
we can convince her to sign the contract.

551
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,359
The founder of Bell maternal and child supplies Co. Ltd.

552
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,719
Chen Ziming.

553
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,079
This is also information that Ms. Tang provided.

554
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,079
Ms. Tang must have some exchange terms, right?

555
00:28:59,239 --> 00:28:59,680
Yes.

556
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:02,719
Fengtang and Bell are working on a partnership,

557
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,640
and Ms. Tang asked you to go with them.

558
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,400
Your little wild wolf appeared suddenly.

559
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,079
Qi.

560
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,880
How about having a meal later?

561
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,160
I have no time.

562
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,319
I have a client appointment later.

563
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,680
Qi, this is...

564
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,680
This is my boyfriend.

565
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,640
We're leaving now first.

566
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, bye.

567
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,400
Qi's boyfriend is quite handsome.

568
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,239
Exactly.

569
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,760
So nice.

570
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,680
What's wrong with you?

571
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,880
Can you pinch me?

572
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:50,680
Are you crazy?

573
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,439
Just pinch me.

574
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,359
It's not a dream.

575
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,479
Are you serious?

576
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,280
I just said that you are my boyfriend.

577
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,439
And you don't even know how to walk.

578
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,359
You walk with the same as hand and foot

579
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,680
Of course.

580
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
I've been waiting for this day for over 20 years.

581
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:09,959
Go.

582
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,199
Let's eat something delicious

583
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,239
to celebrate.

584
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,760
I'm afraid I can't go.

585
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,439
I have an important client to meet tonight,

586
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,359
so I can't go.

587
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,359
Fang Qi.

588
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,839
You're off duty now.

589
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,599
This is your private time.

590
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,880
What kind of private time do we have in this business?

591
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,959
With a phone call,

592
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,520
we have to go to a place

593
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,479
hundreds of kilometers away to make a due diligence.

594
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,599
Working overtime is just a piece of cake.

595
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,520
If you want to gain a foothold in this industry,

596
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,239
you must either have a background at home

597
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,439
or create your own resources.

598
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,839
What kind of person do you think I am?

599
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,040
Why don't you try another job?

600
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You are too naive.

601
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,199
You can ask your sister if she wants to change jobs.

602
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,920
We are warriors in the office building.

603
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:54,160
We all stayed after a lot of hard work.

604
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,800
How can I give up so easily?

605
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,199
Fang Qi.

606
00:30:59,199 --> 00:30:59,959
In your eyes,

607
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,880
work is more important than boyfriend?

608
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,880
You are important to me,

609
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,119
but,

610
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,479
work is the confidence

611
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
to face life for me.

612
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,680
Confidence.

613
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,359
How about this.

614
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,400
If you go with me,

615
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,000
I'll squeeze a little time out,

616
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,119
and have dinner with you,

617
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:22,880
okay?

618
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,479
OK.

619
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,359
Let's go.

620
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,719
I didn't expect to get hit in the face so soon.

621
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,359
Director Xu should think clearly.

622
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,119
You are so stubborn now,

623
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,719
and if one day you want to apologize,

624
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,160
don't be embarrassed.

625
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,359
Who'd like to apologize to you?

626
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:55,959
Mr. Mo,

627
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,160
don't think too much.

628
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,880
Otherwise, let it go.

629
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,199
If it doesn't work,

630
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,119
I'm embarrassed.

631
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,359
The noble and glamorous style

632
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,839
must be implemented to the end.

633
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,040
Mr. Mo.

634
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,599
Why are you coming back now?

635
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:17,719
I was wondering if I should pick you up.

636
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,959
What happened to you?

637
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:23,719
Come here.

638
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,920
Please.

639
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,199
You did it?

640
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,920
It is a piece of cake.

641
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,319
Oh, the wine.

642
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,079
Just give me a second.

643
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,239
You sit.

644
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,599
Come on.

645
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,560
Please.

646
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,599
Director Xu has made great progress.

647
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,680
Of course.

648
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,479
You're not the only one

649
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,479
with a gift for cooking.

650
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,239
Actually, I have more.

651
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,479
Yes, it is.

652
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,119
Especially in acting.

653
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,359
Natural, smooth,

654
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,680
and without a trace.

655
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,119
Instead of ordering takeaway,

656
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,199
you buy semi-finished products
directly from the supermarket.

657
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,199
You are too casual.

658
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,560
I seemed to say last time that

659
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,239
if someone wants to apologize someday,

660
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,359
she will be embarrassed.

661
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:37,719
I think too much.

662
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,479
Are you sure?

663
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,959
You think I don't need to put on plates

664
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,760
or heat the things bought in the supermarket,

665
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,560
do you?

666
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,959
I'm really apologizing now,

667
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
you'd better accept it quickly.

668
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,079
Sorry.

669
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,079
Try it.

670
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,840
I did misunderstand you about the competition.

671
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,399
But I'm not mad at you.

672
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,199
I just feel ashamed of

673
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,439
failing in front of you.

674
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,199
How can it be?

675
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,000
Director Xu.

676
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,280
I think it's beautiful when you're serious.

677
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,120
How about this,

678
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,239
I promise you that

679
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,199
if there is any misunderstanding in the future,

680
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,040
I will communicate with you first

681
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,760
and not get angry,

682
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,919
OK?

683
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,360
OK.

684
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,239
Come on.

685
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,120
Cheers!

686
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Cheers!

687
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,630
(Tang Xi)

688
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,080
I won't answer.

689
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:09,600
If I hear anything,

690
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:10,959
you'll have to comfort me.

691
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:11,959
That would be a problem.

692
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,199
Didn't someone just say that

693
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,679
we should communicate first?

694
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,520
Go ahead.

695
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,439
I have nothing to hide.

696
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,600
OK.

697
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,600
Then I'll put it on speaker.

698
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,719
Hello, Lingze.

699
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,239
I know that you haven't slept yet.

700
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,760
This business trip is going to be overnight,

701
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,679
remember to bring a change of clothes.
