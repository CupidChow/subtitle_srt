3
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,199
I know the information about Hua Yu is just a cover.

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,919
I come to see you because

5
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,639
I hope you know enough is enough.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Let it go.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,040
Why should I let it go?

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
You didn't forget

9
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,120
anything about us, did you?

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,400
No, I didn't.

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,839
Everything in the past really happened.

12
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,400
It's deceiving myself if I say I've forgotten.

13
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,519
The vital significance

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,559
of the past relationship

15
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:57,239
is teaching me how to cherish the present.

16
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,720
Xu Qingyou?

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,360
Yes.

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,440
How can you be sure she's your Ms. Right?

19
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,239
Why are you so confident?

20
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,240
It's not confidence.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,639
I just believe her.

22
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,399
You might leave now.

23
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,770
(No new messages from Mo Lingze)

24
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,570
(Fang Qi)

25
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:13,800
Hello?

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,080
Xu Qingyou.

27
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,240
See?

28
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,199
With beauty and charm,

29
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,919
I'm the only heroine of the gallery.

30
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,520
Yes, young girl.

31
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,440
You're really a goddess in

32
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:30,119
your fanboy's eyes.

33
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,199
Even Gu Dayan says you're amazing.

34
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,240
Gu Dayan?

35
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,119
Where's Poker Face?

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,679
Isn't he with you?

37
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:40,360
He...he went to have a meeting with Tang Xi.

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,279
Since they're talking about work,

39
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,320
I support him of course.

40
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,039
Without any jealousy.

41
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,199
Support him?

42
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,839
If I guess correctly,

43
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,839
you're in the game room now.

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
Throwing the ball,

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,919
hitting your target

46
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,479
to vent your anger.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,960
Don't I look calm?

48
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,320
Come on.

49
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,520
You're so calm.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,199
You're calm all the time.

51
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,960
I see.

52
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,640
I didn't expect you could remember me

53
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,880
at that time after so long.

54
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,000
How's that?

55
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,679
Don't you think my status in your heart

56
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:31,720
has suddenly improved?

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,440
Please don't be too complacent.

58
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,679
Mr. Xu.

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,480
I want to tell you seriously.

60
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,440
I didn't participate in most of your memories.

61
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,600
But from now on,

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,079
our memories will be continuous and

63
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,079
full of vigor.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
We'll stick together in life and death

65
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,279
and bear children.

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,160
How dare you take advantage of me so blatantly?

67
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,200
Then I'll gracefully let you know

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,839
what is living death.

69
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,359
Chivalrous Woman Fang.

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,600
Please be straight forward.

71
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,359
Let's go.

72
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,160
What brings you here?

73
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,279
I just come to have a drink with you.

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,160
OK.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,839
Same as usual.

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,480
Thank you.

77
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,559
You've given him up?

78
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,959
Li Sa.

79
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,239
I hate you.

80
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,519
Why can you know me so well?

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You look deep,

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,640
but sometimes you're simple.

83
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,079
You like to pretend to be

84
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,000
so strong after getting injured.

85
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,119
But your eyes told me everything.

86
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,119
His love belonged to

87
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,559
me before.

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,359
But now I don't want it.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,839
I have to correct you.

90
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,559
The fact is you won't get it.

91
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:19,720
I can tell you.

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,760
I'm wasting

93
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,640
my time if it goes on.

94
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,600
And

95
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,000
it shows I'm not liberal enough.

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,799
Yes.

97
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,440
Liberal.

98
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,519
To your liberality!

99
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,040
Stop.

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,920
Turn left.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,440
Why?

102
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,519
Turn left.

103
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
More and more

104
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,160
and more and more.

105
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,559
Are you a sniffing dog?

106
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,359
I just want to prevent you from turning from

107
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,720
a domestic dog into a merciful stray dog.

108
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,000
Here you are.

109
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,359
What?

110
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,799
I'm worried that someone will be heartbroken.

111
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,799
So I cursorily make the two.

112
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,440
After some thinking, however,

113
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,839
someone's work is more cursory.

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,119
There's no evidence.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,679
My work is perfect.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,600
What?

117
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,160
You look down upon my "shoehorn".

118
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Sorry.

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,000
Director Xu,

120
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,160
I'm clumsy.

121
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
So I can only shape it a circle.

122
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,959
You like it?

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,279
No.

124
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,160
I like my broken "shoehorn".

125
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,040
OK.

126
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,160
Then let's throw it away.

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,519
No no no.

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,920
It's the evidence.

129
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,160
In case we quarrel in the future,

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,760
this is the best evidence showing you love me.

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,580
(Tang Xi: Ten years ago, I left without saying goodbye. 
Let's have a meal tomorrow as my compensation.)

132
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,720
Are you trying to make me trust you

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,959
or showing off?

134
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,640
What do you think?

135
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,320
It depends on whether I give you a chance.

136
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,920
I see.

137
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,720
(No, thanks)

138
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,599
Would you like to buy it as a gift?

139
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,799
For dining together.

140
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,640
Farewell dinner.

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,359
Please take your time.

142
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:43,799
OK.

143
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,359
Thank you.

144
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,320
You're welcome.

145
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,440
It's not suitable.

146
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,840
It's called Attendre

147
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,159
which means waiting.

148
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,159
It's not suitable if you

149
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,520
bring it to a party, right?

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,119
I think it's interesting.

151
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,640
There's a story behind it.

152
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,440
In the Middle Ages,

153
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,440
a woman planted a cherry tree every year

154
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,599
in order to wait for her lover.

155
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Later, the trees became a forest.

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,559
Her lover still hadn't come back.

157
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,559
But you won't know the answer

158
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
until the last moment

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,559
if you decide to wait for someone.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,359
Although her lover didn't come back

161
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,039
she has had a forest

162
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,400
of her own.

163
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,400
How about this one?

164
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,719
Sauvignon Gris in 1982.

165
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,159
The palate has layers of flavours.

166
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,679
And it tastes soft.

167
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,640
I think you'll like it.

168
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,000
And it's suitable for a party.

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,559
Thank you.

170
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,840
I think you're right.

171
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,520
A lover is just a part of her life.

172
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,640
But the forest belongs to herself.

173
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,599
I've never seen a sentimental movie,

174
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
because my face will be wet with tears

175
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,799
if I see separateness.

176
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,039
If you don't want to go,

177
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,359
we won't go.

178
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,960
Here you are.

179
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,880
Go ahead.

180
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,880
Those are your memories.

181
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,359
You should say good-bye to them.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,599
How about you?

183
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,000
I belong to your present and future.

184
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,520
I'll go around nearby.

185
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,719
Tell me when it's over.

186
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,640
OK.

187
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,599
Scallops.

188
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,919
Don't put there.

189
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,799
Put them near Lingze.

190
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,520
He loves them.

191
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,159
Duck blood curd is Bobo's favorite.

192
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,799
Here you are.

193
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,239
And Sa's tender beef and spinach.

194
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,080
It's ready.

195
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,880
You still remember what's my favorite.

196
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,159
Distinctly.

197
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,320
Distinctly.

198
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,880
And you miss everything.

199
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,840
Why did you leave at that time?

200
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:09,919
You left.

201
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:10,799
Great!

202
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,799
Well done!

203
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,719
But how about us?

204
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,719
The band broke up.

205
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
The tour came to nothing.

206
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,320
We even borrowed the liquidated damages.

207
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,119
You know what's the most important?

208
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,880
I lost my home here.

209
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,760
My home, you know?

210
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,440
And Lingze.

211
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,559
Have you thought about him?

212
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,320
Bobo.

213
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,000
Bobo.

214
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,840
Let him talk.

215
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,919
We're all here tonight.

216
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,799
Let's explain clearly.

217
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,159
Tang Xi.

218
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,599
Our band started because of you.

219
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,039
It ended because of you, too.

220
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
I usually think

221
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,960
you regard us as tools.

222
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,280
You can use or

223
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,640
throw us away whenever you want to.

224
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,880
Actually I only want to know

225
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,479
what you regard us as in your heart.

226
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,840
Friends.

227
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,760
One two three four.

228
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,080
You're the only

229
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,440
friends of mine in the world.

230
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,799
Then why did you leave?

231
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,200
What's your reason?

232
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,640
First, you should give your

233
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,679
only friends a reasonable explanation.

234
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,440
Bobo.

235
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,039
A university professor, right?

236
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,200
You're having a good life, right?

237
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,280
Luo is the boss of the hotpot restaurant, right?

238
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,440
And Lingze.

239
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,440
He's respected by peers now.

240
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,880
Mr. Mo.

241
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,880
I'm curious about it.

242
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,280
If I didn't leave at that time

243
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,400
and we were in a band,

244
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,559
then what would we do?

245
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm afraid we can't even pay the rent.

246
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,719
Do you think

247
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,159
opportunities can come

248
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,359
to you every day in this world?

249
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,159
There was a precious

250
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,320
opportunity in front of me.

251
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,359
Why should I refuse?

252
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,239
Isn't it vanity?

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,799
You're talking a good game.

254
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,080
You're right.

255
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,520
That's vanity.

256
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,000
But do you think it's easy for me?

257
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,880
I can only rely on myself

258
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,200
along the way.

259
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,719
When I was experiencing hard times abroad alone,

260
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,320
what were you doing?

261
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,000
I've got all I want.

262
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,479
I have no regrets.

263
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,239
As for the wonderful memories,

264
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,440
let's put them at the bottom of our hearts.

265
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
You also like bands?

266
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,919
Yes.

267
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,080
This is your territory?

268
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,679
Yes.

269
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,119
Boss.

270
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,479
My band wants to take charge

271
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,520
of all the shows here.

272
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,840
All the shows?

273
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,280
How many members in your band?

274
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,559
Only one at present.

275
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,679
But I can get enough members right away.

276
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Then you can come to me when you get them.

277
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,520
OK.

278
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:00,559
Excuse me.

279
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,320
Sorry to bother you.

280
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm Tang Xi,

281
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,840
the lead singer of your band in the future.

282
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,719
We'll rehearse the day after tomorrow.

283
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,719
Eight o'clock.

284
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,000
Let's gather at the gate of the academic building.

285
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,479
I have no interest.

286
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,200
Wait a second.

287
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,719
You look

288
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,719
distant at the first sight.

289
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,320
But there's something warm in your music.

290
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,840
If you refuse me today,

291
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,000
you must be regretful.

292
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,640
We've formed our band today!

293
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,239
Wish our

294
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,400
strong and united Sand Band

295
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,840
-a successful performance!  -Success!

296
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,640
I can enjoy

297
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,760
music and youth

298
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,960
with all of you.

299
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:15,919
Come on.

300
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:17,559
Cheers!

301
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,440
Let bygones be bygones!

302
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,799
-Cheers!  -Cheers!

303
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,000
My dancing friend.

304
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Wait a second.

305
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,039
You're dancing so well.

306
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,080
Answer my question.

307
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,440
Do you still think I regard

308
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,159
you as tools now?

309
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,080
We all know

310
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,799
you haven't.

311
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,079
I haven't.

312
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
Then again

313
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,959
a decade has passed,

314
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,119
why do you still order Mr. Mo

315
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
to hail a taxi for you?

316
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,199
You don't understand.

317
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
He's glad to

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,439
help us to do it.

319
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,439
It shows he's the core

320
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,119
of our team.

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,199
You're lazy,

322
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,520
so it's reasonable.

323
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,439
Hard work, Mr. Mo.

324
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,119
I don't need your help today.

325
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll go alone.

326
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,719
Tang Xi.

327
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,280
Thank you for giving me a hand in the dark.

328
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,760
I'll remember it forever.

329
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
Only this?

330
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:47,880
Tang.

331
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,719
Where are you going?

332
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,000
That's a secret.

333
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,439
Leave without saying goodbye again?

334
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,959
Don't you remember?

335
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,239
Tang won't stop at

336
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,880
one place all the time.

337
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,920
The young love lively life.

338
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,359
Our friendship will be long and lasting.

339
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,920
But

340
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,719
it must be boring and lonely if she goes home alone.

341
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,640
Right?

342
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,560
Yes.

343
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,400
But now it's different.

344
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,560
After the party,

345
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,000
there's a light for me at home.

346
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,400
There's a person

347
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,880
waiting for me at home.

348
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
I won't feel lonely anymore.

349
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,199
Who?

350
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,000
My son.

351
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,599
Your son?

352
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,199
You're showing off.

353
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,079
You're showing off you have a son.

354
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:38,959
Go away.

355
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,319
-Come here.  -Let's go and get in the car.

356
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,599
-You want to leave me alone, right?  -Let's go.

357
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:42,920
That's what I think.

358
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,880
Hurry up and it's time to leave.

359
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:44,839
We have to go now, Lingze.

360
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,880
-Bye bye.  -Close the door.

361
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,400
Bye bye.

362
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,239
Bye bye.

363
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,560
Florid face

364
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,439
and bright eyes.

365
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,199
It seems that I've chosen the good wine.

366
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,959
But it seems that another bottle on the table

367
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,239
is more in line with your taste.

368
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,760
You've met her before?

369
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Have you heard that

370
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,000
it would be a little boring if you're too smart.

371
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,359
But

372
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,640
since you've seen through my little game,

373
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,760
you have to tell me which one

374
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,079
you'll choose.

375
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,520
It seems to be a dead end.

376
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,000
I won't be hooked.

377
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,079
Since you've been my boyfriend,

378
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,199
you have to make a choice.

379
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,400
Do you smell it?

380
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,079
I didn't drink.

381
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
Because you're waiting for me.

382
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,839
It seems you live to tell the tale again.

383
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,079
I didn't understand

384
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,479
what Bobo said until now.

385
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,079
The kitten went home.

386
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,680
Let's go home.

387
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Good morning.

388
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,839
I made an appointment with the technical department.

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,800
OK. Please.

390
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,359
Good morning, Ms. Xu.

391
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,079
Ms. Xu.

392
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,239
Thank you for

393
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:13,719
your coffee for our new department.

394
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:14,880
You're welcome.

395
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,839
There will be a meeting later.

396
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,680
Get ready.

397
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,239
OK.

398
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,479
Director Long.

399
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,959
Wanna a cup of coffee?

400
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,079
Humph!

401
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,599
Thank you, Mr. Mo, for buying popularity for me.

402
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:50,920
It's no big deal.

403
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,439
It's the duty of a boyfriend.

404
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,079
Have you resigned?

405
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,599
When will it end?

406
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,079
Will you come to the meeting?

407
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,119
I'll pick you up.

408
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,079
Don't worry.

409
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,000
Today I'll plan our

410
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,160
business first.

411
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,959
You're beside the point.

412
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,359
Wang Ji.

413
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:23,599
If you dare to flinch,

414
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,400
I will kill you.

415
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,479
Ji.

416
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,760
Everything should be considered in the long run.

417
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,280
You're right.

418
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,400
It's more important to plan our business.

419
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,439
We can take actions separately

420
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,239
and cooperate.

421
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,280
Remember to resign today.

422
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,390
(Resignation Letter)

423
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:29,800
What are you doing?

424
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:33,079
The plant is a little withered.

425
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm going to water it.

426
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,760
It's artificial, isn't it?

427
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm more partial to it as time goes on.

428
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,520
Anything else?

429
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,079
Mr. Mo.

430
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,160
Actually today...

431
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I would like to tell you directly

432
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,680
or I'm so stressed.

433
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,239
Is there any problems with Hua Group's M & A?

434
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:18,719
Yes.

435
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:21,000
But nothing in the world is difficult for

436
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,239
one who works overtime.

437
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,160
I'm going to work.

438
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:51,959
Hello.

439
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,479
I'm Xu Wei.

440
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:54,880
What?

441
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,719
You want to buy my painting?

442
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,439
100 thousand yuan?

443
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:03,839
A crook, obviously.

444
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,959
I've seen a lot of people like you.

445
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,079
Never try to cheat me with the simple deception.

446
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,560
Accept it first.

447
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,239
Remember.

448
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,319
You're an artist.

449
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:24,560
Well.

450
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,239
I'll give you my E-mail address...

451
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,000
No.

452
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,680
I'll give you my agent's E-mail address.

453
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:34,599
OK.

454
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,560
I don't think it's true.

455
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,319
Your E-mail address.

456
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,599
Wait and see what will happen.

457
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,079
Nailed it.

458
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,160
Is that true?

459
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
My painting sells for 100 thousand yuan.

460
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't think it's true.

461
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,880
We can see what he sends to us later.

462
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,719
He has sent something to us.

463
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,400
So fast.

464
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,600
(Art Work Purchase Contract: 100,000 yuan)

465
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
It's true!

466
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,160
100 thousand yuan!

467
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,359
And he will give a deposit of 10,000 yuan

468
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,880
after signing the contract.

469
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,239
Boy!

470
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,000
You'll be Artist Xu, the ace of Yes Art

471
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
in the future.

472
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,880
Why is the title so long?

473
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,680
Foreign style.

474
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,839
The longer, the better.

475
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,880
The more distant, the more superior.

476
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,560
But I'm worried now.

477
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,079
You can't be degenerate for money in the future.

478
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,199
I'll buy gifts worth

479
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,079
3300 yuan respectively for

480
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:37,319
Fang Qi, my parents and Qingyou.

481
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Then what I say will carry

482
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,719
a lot of weight at home.

483
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:44,599
Did you forget a hero

484
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,880
supporting you behind all the time?

485
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,719
You're right.

486
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,719
There will be 100 yuan left.

487
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,119
Dayan, it's yours.

488
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,319
To buy whatever you want.

489
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,640
What?

490
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:56,719
You, you...

491
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,119
And

492
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,560
don't stay at the studio at night.

493
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,319
I got things to do.

494
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,439
How complacent you are now!

495
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,479
Occupy my studio.

496
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:05,160
Leave me only 100 yuan.

497
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,079
What an unreasonable person!

498
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,119
Happy the 35th Day!

499
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:46,680
Flattery with no reasons,

500
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,000
either craftiness or stealing.

501
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,359
Did you make any mistakes?

502
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,839
Actually, someone ordered my painting.

503
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,599
I advanced the deposit from my credit card.

504
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,560
I want to buy you a present the first time.

505
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,760
Is this your usual trick to flirt with a girl?

506
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,239
Flirt with a girl?

507
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,359
A real man only cares about

508
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,719
how to be more powerful at home.

509
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,719
From the moment I sold my painting,

510
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,959
I was firmly on the throne.

511
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,560
If you want to catch on to him in this way,

512
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,160
I suggest you stop wasting your time.

513
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,560
But in the process of investigation,

514
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,880
I got something unexpected.

515
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,719
If Master knows this,

516
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,640
he won't agree you to be together.

517
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,040
Xu Qingyou.

518
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,959
Who the hell did you find as a boyfriend?

519
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,719
A troubled teenager in the past.

520
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,839
The player in investment banks now.

521
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,719
Family misfortune happened in his teen years.

522
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,160
His father was imprisoned and his mother 
committed suicide when he's eighteen.

523
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:04,319
Look.

524
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,920
Dad.

525
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,680
I think your work unworthy of your talents.

526
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,400
You should be a private detective.

527
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,479
Don't be glib here!

528
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,319
How long are you going to hide it from me?

529
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,959
What does that mean?

530
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,079
A piece of paper can

531
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,680
tell us everything?

532
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,719
A small sign can indicate a great trend.

533
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,839
It's enough to show that

534
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,079
he can't be your boyfriend.

535
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,920
You have your view of the important
overshadowed by the trivial.

536
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,800
Anyway, I won't agree.

537
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,520
I didn't expect that Mo

538
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,560
had a rich experience.

539
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,079
But he's so good-looking.

540
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,119
Look at his height.

541
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,959
183 cm.

542
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:47,119
That's great.

543
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,280
So what?

544
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,800
Our family don't lack the good gene.

545
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:52,920
Look.

546
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,520
A range of disadvantages.

547
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,719
He's not a good man.

548
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,680
You were not so good, either.

549
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,359
I did marry you in the end.

550
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,319
Why do you think I'm not good?

551
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,920
Didn't you remember

552
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,000
you flirted with Xiaofang

553
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,599
in your class

554
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,040
all day.

555
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,400
Never try to hide it from me!

556
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,359
Look.

557
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,160
There you go again.

558
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,599
What?

559
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,560
It's the fact.

560
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,520
Dad, Mom.

561
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,160
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

562
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,560
Let me tell you.

563
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:22,599
Don't come back

564
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,800
if you still get your own way.

565
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,199
Let me tell you.

566
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,079
I'll wait and see what will happen,

567
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
if Youyou never comes back.

568
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,199
Answer my question.

569
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,359
Does Qingyou become

570
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,400
a sucker for Mo recently?

571
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,560
Dad.

572
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,800
Leave it alone.

573
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,359
Qingyou broke up with Fan Yunxi because he had affairs.

574
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:02,959
What?

575
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,719
Fan Yunxi?

576
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,040
Master.

577
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,000
You need to see me?

578
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,719
You can call me at any time.

579
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,560
About the information?

580
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,520
This pen

581
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,719
was the present you bought me

582
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,760
with your first salary.

583
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,640
I've been keeping it with me.

584
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,160
Today I'll give it back to you.

585
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,680
Master.

586
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,079
You're not my student in the future.

587
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,479
Maybe the society can go easy on

588
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,199
a lawyer who has affairs.

589
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,479
But as Youyou's father,

590
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,400
there's no way.

591
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,599
Master.

592
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
Sorry. It's my fault.

593
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,199
I'm feeling guilty about that.

594
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,599
It's just a moment of carelessness.

595
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,119
I really hope to restart the relationship with Youyou.

596
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,520
I hope you can give me another chance.

597
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,560
You made your bed. Now lie in it.

598
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,040
Master, I...
