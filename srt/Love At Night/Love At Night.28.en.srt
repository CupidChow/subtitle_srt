3
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,800
What does my dad mean, mom?

4
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
They have looked at each other for 10 minutes.

5
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,680
Can't you see his intention?

6
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:02,879
He just wants to overpower Mo.

7
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,680
Look at him,

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,879
how strong he is right now.

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,360
Come on.

10
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,720
We have a family dinner today,

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,919
why are you here?

12
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,399
Dad, you invited him to dinner, didn't you?

13
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,479
When are you going to hold the wedding?

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,800
It's up to Qingyou.

15
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,399
Where do you live after marriage?

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,800
In my house.

17
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,639
Or we can move to be your neighbors.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,839
How many children are you going to have?

19
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,199
You see, your dad is crazy again.

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,479
Dad!

21
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,679
Stop acting, okay?

22
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,479
I know you like Mo so much.

23
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,600
Why do you pretend to be like this?

24
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,320
Mo, don't mind what your uncle did.

25
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,440
Have some tea.

26
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,919
OK.

27
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,279
Thank you, auntie.

28
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,399
Wait, is the tea cold?

29
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:58,720
No.

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Go get some hot water for Mo.

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,800
Alright, alright.

32
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,199
Never mind, I'll do it.

33
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,199
Come on, come on.

34
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,399
You're a guest. I'll do it.

35
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,279
Let me do it.

36
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,199
It's all right, uncle, let me do it.

37
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:15,800
What do you think?

38
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,479
Did I act in a perfect manner?

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,160
Listen to me,

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,639
you'd better play no tricks at dinner today,

41
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,720
and don't act inappropriately.

42
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
Or I'll hit you.

43
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,800
Got it.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,720
Yes, madam.

45
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,160
Give me a smile.

46
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,720
Let's go.

47
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,679
Help yourself.

48
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,800
Come on, let's toast.

49
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,639
Okay.

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,919
Welcome.

51
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,720
Welcome to our home.

52
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,119
Come on.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,479
Oh right, Mo.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,399
From now on,

55
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,839
you can often come to our house for dinner.

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
I like to be together.

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,720
I'd love to.

58
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,959
By the way, I heard that Fang Qi works with you.

59
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,200
Yeah, he is actually my leader.

60
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
What a coincidence!

61
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,959
Fang Qi.

62
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,200
How is your leader

63
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,799
doing in the company?

64
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,839
Is he nice to you?

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,279
Mr. Mo.

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,880
He is usually not very accessible.

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,079
In a businesslike manner, I mean.

68
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,480
Working with him is like walking on thin ice.

69
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,399
We've been working together
for more than half a year,

70
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,200
and didn't open hearts to each other.

71
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,920
Never mind, Fang Qi.

72
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,959
Just speak out what is on your mind.

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
We are friends at this moment.

74
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,720
I'll be your leader tomorrow in the company.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Fang Qi.

76
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,320
Eat dumplings.

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,640
While,

78
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,399
thanks to such a working attitude,

79
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,920
he will not be dominated by interests.

80
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,200
Although we didn't open hearts to each other,

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,040
he will solve my problems at the critical moment.

82
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,359
I feel really happy

83
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,480
to have such a leader.

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,880
Fang Qi said he was good, that must be true.

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,799
Come on.

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,640
Mo.

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,160
In the company, please give Fang Qi

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,279
more support and consideration.

89
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Right, Fang Qi

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,399
grew up in my house,

91
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,160
and I treat her as my own daughter.

92
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,359
Sure.

93
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,720
She's surname is not Xu.

94
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,480
Why does she become your daughter?

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,720
You silly boy!

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,600
Shut up, what do you know, boy?

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,799
Xu Wei has grown up now,

98
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,839
in my mind,

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,679
he has also succeeded in career,

100
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,959
he's not a boy.

101
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,559
Whether your career is successful

102
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,200
is not that important in parents' mind.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,679
The point is

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,119
to be healthy,

105
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,119
and to grow up happily.

106
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,799
Then,

107
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,640
we hope you can find the right person

108
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,679
and live in happiness,

109
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,519
that's the most important.

110
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
I don't know

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,440
when he will find a girlfriend.

112
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,559
He's young, take it easy.

113
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,519
Look at you!

114
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,880
Who says I don't have a girlfriend?

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
I wonder which girl has a bad judgment

116
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
and takes a fancy to him.

117
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,399
Stop it, just eat.

118
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,839
Auntie, this dish is so delicious.

119
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:33,880
Really?

120
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,480
Then eat more if you like.

121
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,880
Here you go.

122
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,880
Help yourself.

123
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,160
Help yourself.

124
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,959
Come in.

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
My father lets you off so easily.

126
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,760
It is really a surprise!

127
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,239
So cute!

128
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,160
Sure.

129
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,880
Look at this girl!

130
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,640
She looks so

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,920
classic.

132
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,760
You're just saying I'm old-fashioned, aren't you?

133
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,440
I was the belle of our class.

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,279
You know how long can eternity last,

135
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,640
that is the distance to see the scenery
side by side with you.

136
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,679
So romantic, belle.

137
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,720
What? Are you jealous?

138
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,320
It's written by my desk mate.

139
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,839
The distance side by side means we sat side by side.

140
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,679
He used to be a member of the photography club,

141
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,600
and I was his model.

142
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,119
We are absolutely friends.

143
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,839
I wonder

144
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,559
how many friends like this did you have?

145
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,959
There is a more special one.

146
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,040
Especially rare and precious one.

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,480
From now on, I only listen to Xu Qingyou.

148
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,519
I won't question what she said.

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,920
If I break my promise...

150
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Delete this video.

151
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,679
Why should I delete it?

152
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:04,239
Just do it, will you?

153
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:04,959
This is a precious memory.

154
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,279
Will you delete it or not?

155
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:05,920
Wait, no.

156
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,880
- Don't grab! - I'll delete it if you don't.

157
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:10,320
Sis.

158
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,480
I didn't see anything. Go on.

159
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,000
What happened?

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,760
Why don't you knock?

161
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,640
Are you bullying the weak by being strong?

162
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,600
What? He didn't knock first.

163
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,559
He didn't see anything.

164
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,359
Don't be serious.

165
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,200
Right. Don't be serious.

166
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,320
So can we.

167
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,320
Uncle and auntie

168
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,679
must haven't seen this scene yet.

169
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,239
Sorry to bother you.

170
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,479
Still can't accept it.

171
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,159
Delete it now.

172
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,400
Or I'll call the police.

173
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,640
No, I won't delete it.

174
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,719
Stop.

175
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,520
When I kissed you just now,

176
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,919
did you avoid me?

177
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,039
What did we say at the door just now?

178
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,200
Don't go too far.

179
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,080
What did I do?

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,359
I just kissed you.

181
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,440
Stop it!

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,400
Fang Qi is your sister!

183
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,000
You (kissed)...

184
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,599
your sister.

185
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,679
Uncle, we're not serious.

186
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,359
Uncle.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,440
Dad.

188
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,679
Uncle.

189
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,960
I...I'll beat you.

190
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,520
Uncle.

191
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,320
- Dad! - Bad boy!

192
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,559
We were playing.

193
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,159
Uncle.

194
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,799
What happened?

195
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,960
He kissed his sister.

196
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,559
Dad, listen to me.

197
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,280
Uncle.

198
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,559
What happened?

199
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,039
Uncle.

200
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,359
Make it clear to me.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What happened?

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,320
How dare you!

203
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,200
Uncle, what happened?

204
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,559
- Don't beat him. - How dare you!

205
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,320
Don't hurt Mo.

206
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,000
Calm down.

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,840
Dad.

208
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,119
Mom, please control the situation.

209
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't hurt Xu Wei.

210
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,440
Don't worry. I know.

211
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:57,960
Your dad

212
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,520
is too angry at the present moment.

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,400
It's no use saying anything.

214
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:03,280
By the way, Mo.

215
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,320
Come home for dinner if you're free.

216
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,039
Sure, aunt.

217
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,359
I won't keep you longer.

218
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,080
Go back.

219
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,359
Does it hurt?

220
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,239
I have to say,

221
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,719
your father hit Xu Wei really hard.

222
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,880
If I didn't stop him some times...

223
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,719
That's my dad.

224
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,679
He used to hit us a lot.

225
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,640
Your dad even hit you?

226
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,719
He has a hot temper.

227
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,719
Uncle, auntie.

228
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:50,840
You misunderstood us.

229
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,080
We are not serious.

230
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,520
I'm serious.

231
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,520
Then tell me,

232
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
what's going on?

233
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,159
Fang Qi and I are in love.

234
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:04,880
I object.

235
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,799
Why don't you agree?

236
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,039
Love without blood relationship

237
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,320
is protected by law.

238
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,119
Did you hear that?

239
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
How dare you talk to me about the law?

240
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,559
Don't you know that

241
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,000
she's your sister?

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,159
She's my sister, so what?

243
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,479
I mean it.

244
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,640
Can you stop acting like a tyrant?

245
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
Please respect my opinion.

246
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,559
Stop talking, Xu Wei.

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
I...he...

248
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,640
He is...

249
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,960
That's enough.

250
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,880
Did you hear what he said?

251
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
Yes, I'll handle it.

252
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
That's enough.

253
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,640
Fang Qi, don't blame your uncle.

254
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,359
The point is, it happened so suddenly.

255
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,520
Give us some time

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
to accept it, okay?

257
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Well.

258
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,119
Uncle, auntie.

259
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,599
As for this matter, we were abrupt

260
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,400
and thoughtless.

261
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,440
Um...

262
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,359
I think I should go.

263
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,960
I'm sorry, sorry.

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,400
Fang.

265
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,119
Fang Qi.

266
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,919
He...

267
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,119
Put it on. It's cold outside.

268
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,919
Wait for me.

269
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:26,280
What's wrong?

270
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,880
Hurry up.

271
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,440
Go and get Quick-Acting Heart Pill for me.

272
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,039
I can't stand it.

273
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,080
Fang Qi, Fang Qi.

274
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,479
Why are you so childish?

275
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,080
Why did you say so?

276
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,000
Is it mature to keep secret from them

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,479
and have a secret love all the time?

278
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,520
Anyway, this step will be made

279
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,440
sooner or later.

280
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,679
You've made a step forward,

281
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,119
and I'm over.

282
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,479
Then I wonder

283
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,640
why you mind so much

284
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,799
my parents knowing that?

285
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,119
OK, I'll tell you the reason.

286
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,840
My mother died when I was a child,

287
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
and my father went abroad.

288
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,880
I grew up in the your family with your sister.

289
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,159
Your parents have treated me as their own daughter.

290
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,000
But I am a divorced woman

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,880
who is eight years older than you.

292
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,320
Suddenly, I fell in love

293
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,640
with their baby son.

294
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,719
Do you think they can accept it for a while?

295
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,840
Divorced, eight years older than me,

296
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,000
so what?

297
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,559
They watched you grow up,

298
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,039
don't they know

299
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,039
what kind of person you are?

300
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
They just need some time

301
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,960
to accept the fact.

302
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,559
They can't accept it.

303
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,119
I don't care.

304
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,960
I want to be with you.

305
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,440
I hope to live happily with you in the future.

306
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,359
Is this wrong?

307
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,880
If you care what others think of you,

308
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,159
I can...

309
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,400
What can you do?

310
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,679
Can you fight against the world for me?

311
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,440
I'd like to.

312
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
But I don't.

313
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,559
I think I should go back and have a look.

314
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,479
I'm afraid my father hit Xu Wei so bad.

315
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Xu Wei has grown up.

316
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,880
You should believe that he can solve it.

317
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,080
But in my eyes,

318
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,080
he's still like a coward

319
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,960
who is afraid of the dark 
and will come to me in a power cut.

320
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,440
Now this coward is not afraid to fight against the world

321
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,000
for the people he loves.

322
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,880
So as a sister, you should let go.

323
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,799
Sorry, does it hurt?

324
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,760
I didn't expect on my first day to the Xu family,

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,119
to see the power of feather duster.

326
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,359
My dad punished the chicken 
as a warning to the monkey.

327
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,239
The chicken means Xu Wei

328
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,000
and you...

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I should be the monkey.

330
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,080
So you'd better be nice to me.

331
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,159
Or I'll buy a feather duster.

332
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,159
To buy a feather duster, huh?

333
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,719
Okay, come on.

334
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,239
Let me carry you.

335
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Why?

336
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,599
Go to buy a feather duster.

337
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,440
OK.

338
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,960
We're going to buy a feather duster.

339
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,479
The board of directors has replied clearly.

340
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,440
Mo.

341
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,320
You are qualified

342
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,799
to nominate partners.

343
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,760
Mr. Luo, it's a long way to go.

344
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,039
I'll keep trying.

345
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,679
Mr. Mo is really young and promising.

346
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,960
In the Changjiang River the waves behind 
drive on those before.

347
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,440
As an elder, I feel inferior.

348
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
(Xu Wei: Babe. I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.)

349
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,479
You haven't eaten all day. Eat something.

350
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,839
Health is the most important.

351
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,319
I remember Qi brought you the porridge in this shop.

352
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,359
You must like it.

353
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,560
You are the backbone of our studio.

354
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,640
If something goes wrong with you,

355
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,160
our studio would be over.

356
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,439
As a stingy person, I even treat you.

357
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,920
Just do me a favor, okay?

358
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,280
Dayan.

359
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,760
You are nice to me.

360
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,040
Come on, open your mouth.

361
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,040
Mr. Xu.

362
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,719
I bought the porridge for you.

363
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you like it?

364
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,439
Presenting Buddha with borrowed flowers, you know.

365
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,599
Come on, give it to you.

366
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,640
It's the same.

367
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:01,920
Have some porridge.

368
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,160
No, thanks.

369
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,680
I've paid for this, so just have some.

370
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,439
No, thanks.

371
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,920
I'm okay.

372
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,560
Thank you.

373
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,079
I'll do it myself.

374
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,599
Mr. Xu, just have a taste.

375
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,359
I'll do it myself.

376
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,239
Enjoy yourself.

377
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,520
How can I forgive you so easy?

378
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,040
I just bought too much porridge.

379
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,140
(Xu Wei: Fang Qi. Can you talk to me? 
My world becomes dark without you.)

380
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,239
Stop talking!

381
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,479
What kind of knife is that?

382
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,439
A knife to kill someone.

383
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:53,040
A knife to make people old.

384
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,199
Knife, knife, knife.

385
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,439
Stop singing, stop.

386
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,800
Give it to me, right now.

387
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,319
What are you doing?

388
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:02,719
God!

389
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,040
Are you singing

390
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,479
or killing me?

391
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,479
Why on earth are you angry?

392
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,040
Are you kidding?

393
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,560
As an intellectual and elegant woman,

394
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,920
how can I be angry?

395
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,560
This word is even not in my dictionary.

396
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:17,760
I just want

397
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,920
Xu Wei to be in relationship with that girl.

398
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,400
Indeed.

399
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,760
A lovely and beautiful young girl.

400
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
I like her if it's me.

401
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,479
You want to annoy me, right?

402
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,160
I won't be fooled.

403
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,760
Too much vinegar (jealousy) is bad for the stomach.

404
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,839
Have some soda to neutralize.

405
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,040
Please.

406
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:40,959
Xu Qingyou.

407
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,719
I always thought you knew me best

408
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,680
in the world.

409
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,079
I'm wrong.

410
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,479
Jealous?

411
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,040
How can I be jealous?

412
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
You're not jealous.

413
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,839
Listen,

414
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,319
I'll tell you a secret of Xu Wei.

415
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,040
You'll be happy after hearing that.

416
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,760
I noticed that

417
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,040
in the group photo he took for us,

418
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,040
I always look indistinct

419
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,520
or black like a coal ball.

420
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,439
And you always look young,

421
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
lovely and beautiful.

422
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,359
Isn't that normal?

423
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,760
I am more beautiful than you.

424
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,880
Don't be silly. That's because of the focus.

425
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:20,920
Xu Wei's focus is on you.

426
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,439
Actually, I used to

427
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,880
worry that he was impulsive.

428
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,199
But later, I found that

429
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,479
long ago,

430
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,719
in his heart,

431
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,000
you are the only one.

432
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,239
I mean it.

433
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,880
So what?

434
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,400
If he wants to find me,

435
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,479
there are 10 thousand ways.

436
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,319
You're just talking!

437
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,199
I tell you,

438
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,800
my brother is popular.

439
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,040
You'd better take advantage of New Year's Eve

440
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,079
to make up with him.

441
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,000
If you don't...

442
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,920
What do you mean?

443
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:57,599
You're going to date Poker Face
on New Year's Eve?

444
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,599
You wanna leave me alone?

445
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,119
Sure, I'm going to date.

446
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,160
If you don't date my brother,

447
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,719
then you will be alone.

448
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,439
Give me my cellphone.

449
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,400
Where's my cellphone? Give it to me.

450
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,160
You don't want to, do you?

451
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,359
- Smell my feet! - Oh no!

452
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,800
- Will you give it to me? - Alright.

453
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
New Year's Eve Association?

454
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,599
The association is for both communication and work.

455
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,199
Maintaining a good relationship

456
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,400
with the young talents of the partners

457
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,719
is good for

458
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,319
better development of Lemi E-commerce.

459
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,119
Mr. Zhai, such a major task,

460
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,880
how about the company buying me a formal dress?

461
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:36,880
Sure.

462
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,839
As the face of our company,

463
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,400
you are obliged to take on the public relations task.

464
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You're making me a social expert.

465
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,520
All our partners and investors

466
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,280
will participate.

467
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,239
Lemi E-commerce must be the focus of the night.

468
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
It's devolved on you.

469
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:53,439
Just accept it.

470
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,199
OK.

471
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,880
Is it necessary?

472
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,719
Can't you refuse?

473
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,760
I have to.

474
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,239
Mr. Zhai invited me.

475
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,280
I have to attend.

476
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,040
But I can promise you,

477
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,479
I will stay focused,

478
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,560
and be serious.

479
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,760
What if another young talent

480
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,880
accosts you?

481
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
I can't guarantee that.

482
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,719
But I can guarantee that

483
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,800
I will be back before twelve o'clock midnight.

484
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,839
No, you must stay until then.

485
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,839
Will you be there?

486
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,439
Mr. Zhai also invited me.

487
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,520
After that,

488
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,079
even in the fiercest days of the war,

489
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,959
he still comes to see her every afternoon.

490
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,439
See?

491
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,439
Even in the fiercest days of the war,

492
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,160
he still comes to see her every afternoon.

493
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,640
In the face of the man's persistence,

494
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,239
loyalty and docility, she was at a loss.

495
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,959
That makes sense.

496
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,680
Let's forget each other.

497
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,280
We're too old to talk about this.

498
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,190
(Xu Wei: Fang Qi. Can you talk to me?
I'm sorry.)

499
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,920
Are you going to be single?

500
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,959
Did I do something wrong, Qi?

501
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,920
Why are you torturing me on New Year's Eve?

502
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,760
Where's Xu Wei?

503
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,839
You...you...

504
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,800
Didn't you spend New Year's Eve with Xu Wei?

505
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,079
What do you mean?

506
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,160
Xu Wei took the painting

507
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,520
and said he was going on a New Year's Eve date.

508
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,920
Who else can he date without you?

509
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,319
Fang Qi.

510
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,599
I'll count down another 100 seconds,

511
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,040
after that, please open the door, okay?

512
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,800
I promise,

513
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,959
I'll make it clear to my parents.

514
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,400
I love you so much.

515
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,719
I want to be with you forever.

516
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:31,959
Thank you.

517
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,119
Director Xu.

518
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,640
Director Xu.

519
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:37,760
Mr. Zhai.

520
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,239
Hello.

521
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,520
Qingyou.

522
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,959
You look beautiful today.

523
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,479
You look gorgeous!

524
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,119
Beauty,

525
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,520
are you an actress?

526
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,359
So sweet.

527
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,280
Actress,

528
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,719
can I take a picture with you?

529
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,359
Sure.

530
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,359
No.

531
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,520
I don't deserve it.

532
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,839
You're too shining.

533
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,000
Here we go.

534
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,239
Cheers.

535
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,839
Qingyou.

536
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,400
Didn't you find that

537
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,079
the way Mr. Mo looks at you

538
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,319
is different from usual?

539
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,040
What's the difference?

540
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,680
I mean it.

541
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,959
Didn't you notice that?

542
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,839
Look,

543
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,119
in his eyes today,

544
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:24,319
except for coldness,

545
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,040
there is a sign of affection.

546
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,800
Affection?

547
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,040
Based on my years of experience,

548
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,640
I think he's probably in love with you.

549
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,079
How many years have you been in love?

550
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
But we think so.

551
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,040
Well then...

552
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,239
Excuse me.

553
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,040
Just do it.

554
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,400
Qingyou.

555
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,040
We believe in you.

556
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:48,560
Hello.

557
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,560
Director Xu, you dressed up so beautifully,

558
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,640
just to attract my attention.

559
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:53,959
Considering our closeness,

560
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:54,920
you don't have to do this.

561
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,079
Mr. Mo.

562
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,400
You are not the only young talent here.

563
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,359
Mr. Mo.

564
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,239
OK.

565
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,199
You can go.

566
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,640
Okay.

567
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,680
Attention, everyone.

568
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,000
It's almost twelve o'clock midnight.

569
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400
Let's count down together.

570
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:19,760
Give me the microphone.

571
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,280
Let's hug the people nearby.

572
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,479
Come to the roof.

573
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,520
Hello, fairy.

574
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,319
Can I invite you to appreciate stars?

575
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,640
The stars are fleeting.

576
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,959
But I have a present for you now.

577
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,280
This gift can keep time,

578
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,400
so it must be worthy of Mr. Mo's invitation.

579
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,200
(Forget to tell you. 
I'm so lucky to meet you)

580
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,000
(Wish the rest of our life
be filled with joy and happiness.)

581
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,100
(If the brain lost all the memories, I would still 
remember you.'Cause you live in my heart.)

582
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,800
(Miss you 98 times every day. Mr. Mo.
Ms. Xu is the one who loves you the most.)

583
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
(When I met you, God told me four words.
Can't escape from you.)

584
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,640
Mr. Mo.

585
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,079
You've got the present,

586
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,199
where's mine?

587
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm afraid I will disappoint you.

588
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,560
Since you're busy,

589
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,920
I'll give you 24 hours

590
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,920
to make up for me.

591
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:35,599
Well,

592
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,920
if 24 hours are not enough,

593
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,839
can I give me to you as a gift?

594
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:42,880
I'll think about it.

595
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,239
What if

596
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,760
I'm not satisfied with the gift?

597
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,319
Can I return it?

598
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,239
Or

599
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,040
lifetime warranty?

600
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,079
No way.

601
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,239
Once sold,

602
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,599
no return or exchange.

603
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,479
It's a hard sell.

604
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,400
Of course.

605
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,079
The countdown has begun.

606
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,239
Come here.

607
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,520
Come on. This way.

608
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:08,920
Here we are.

609
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:29,839
Five, four, three, two, one. Happy new year!

610
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,680
Director Xu.

611
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:55,959
This is the only thing my mother left me

612
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,959
and the thing I cherish most.

613
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,239
I'll give it to you.

614
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,199
Are you willing to accept it?

615
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,199
Sure I am.

616
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,479
It's pretty.

617
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,959
Thanks.

618
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,599
How beautiful!

619
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:37,959
Don't worry.

620
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,600
It has been arranged online.

621
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,360
Mo Lingze.

622
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,840
I'll see what you can do this time.
