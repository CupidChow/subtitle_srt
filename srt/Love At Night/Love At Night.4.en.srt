3
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,120
I think you're dangerous to me.

4
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,959
Dangerous how?

5
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,519
You have keen mind and flawless plans.

6
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,599
I'm not in your league.

7
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,160
What do you mean?

8
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,040
I mean,

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,199
I wish

10
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,279
there were no more accidents in my life.

11
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:03,160
So Director Xu is blaming me for being your accident?

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,720
Of course not.

13
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,480
It's over, isn't it?

14
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,199
But isn't life made up of

15
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,479
countless accidents?

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
You are supposed to

17
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,520
know this better than me.

18
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,479
Wang Ji.

19
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,960
Didn't you say Lingze was working late?

20
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,000
I went there but found no one.

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,479
My midnight snack was all for nothing.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,759
He...

23
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,399
He must be busy.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,039
I saw him just now.

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,279
You did see him?

26
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,520
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,919
Dang it.

28
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,160
What?

29
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,279
No, I can't just go over there.

30
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
It's not cool.

31
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,479
The doll is impossible to grab.

32
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,320
Why do I have to

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,600
do due diligence on this project?

34
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,440
Let's go back to the company now

35
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,119
and tell me about Lingze.

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
If you want me to help,

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,279
at least wait till I'm done.

38
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,000
There's a mall, have some fun shopping.

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,399
Do you think shopping is easy?

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,679
I'm telling you,

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,399
buying a handbag is not easier than catching a doll.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,520
You need to be calm, insightful and decisive.

43
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,039
Let me show you.

44
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,160
Do you think all I have is money?

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,399
I have the brain too.

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,279
I just don't bother to show off.

47
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,960
What do you usually do with your brain?

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,440
You...

49
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
Keep your word.

50
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,039
Who the hell is this woman?

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,279
Youyou.

52
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,720
I know it's hard for you to get over with it,

53
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,519
but I'll wait however long it takes.

54
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:44,839
Youyou.

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,279
What's wrong with your eyes?

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,959
What did you say to mom and dad?

57
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,359
I told him that I'm not good enough to pass the graduate entrance exam.

58
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,880
Now he gives me a cold shoulder.

59
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,519
Mom.

60
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,160
Welcome back.

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,760
Dad.

62
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,119
Let's have dinner.

63
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,000
Lao Xu, dinner is ready.

64
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,679
Alright.

65
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,239
Dad, mom.

66
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,239
Mom, let me help.

67
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,040
You told us that you wouldn't be back for a week.

68
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,200
Why you came back ahead of time?

69
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,320
Dr. Chen, who treats your father's leg,

70
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,799
said he wouldn't be available until next weekend,

71
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,000
that's the reason.

72
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,160
Here you are.

73
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,000
I haven't had a chance to talk to the doctor yet.

74
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,040
What's going on?

75
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,799
Isn't it always Yunxi helping with it?

76
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,320
When is it your turn?

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,399
By the way,

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,200
this is the local pork

79
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,559
we brought from the countryside.

80
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
It's delicious. Try it.

81
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,480
Mom, it's unfair.

82
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,320
You didn't allow me to eat just now

83
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,519
and I had to wait for my sister to come back.

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,760
You such boy. All right.

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,119
Here you go.

86
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:49,880
What's wrong with that?

87
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,600
In our family, girls enjoy most care.

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,320
Come on. It's tradition.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,959
Here you are.

90
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,760
Thank you, dad.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,320
Dad, let me arrange your appointment

92
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,600
with the doctor next time.

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,559
And mom,

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,040
if you feel sick,

95
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,279
let me know as soon as possible.

96
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,519
All right,

97
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,679
Yunxi has already told us that

98
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,760
you are busy

99
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,440
with the promotion and your career.

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
He told us to call him if there's any problem.

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,359
Don't worry about it.

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,480
You see,

103
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,359
Yunxi cares much about you.

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,959
Don't be such a petulant anymore.

105
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,760
Yunxi is my student.

106
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,519
And I'm a good judge of character.

107
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,480
Then you two can get married.

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,359
What did you say?

109
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,679
Come on, please just eat your food.

110
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,839
Hey, how am I supposed to eat it?

111
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,359
Listen to her.

112
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,320
Listen to what she said.

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,679
What's wrong with you?

114
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,440
A university professor.

115
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,279
I think you're always nice

116
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,000
to your students.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,839
But you're always cranky

118
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,119
to our kids when you get home.

119
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:41,959
What's wrong with you?

120
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,040
Menopause, huh?

121
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,799
You are menopausal.

122
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,760
I have a bad temper?

123
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,799
Me, tempered?

124
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
If I don't care about them, who cares?

125
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,160
You?

126
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,000
You, an attending physician,

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,320
watch sweet soap operas at home every day,

128
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,119
you...

129
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,600
Let's toss it.

130
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,480
Face up, I'll take you home.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,040
Tails up. Send you to the police.

132
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,040
Jerk.

133
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,399
We have been together for so long,

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,799
but you cheated on me.

135
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,279
What do you take me for?

136
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,320
Let me make you a drink.

137
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,320
What would you like to drink?

138
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,959
Sparkling water.

139
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,040
Are you on the wagon?

140
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,279
No.

141
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,559
I met someone interesting.

142
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,440
So I want to make a change.

143
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,720
Your date?

144
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,480
Nope.

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,000
Still up?

146
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,559
Right away.

147
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,320
What's up?

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,239
Got into trouble with Yunxi?

149
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,200
You're almost thirty.

150
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,359
Don't act like a child.

151
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:50,520
Yunxi's enterprise is getting bigger and bigger.

152
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
He is very busy.

153
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,679
You need to understand him and look at the bright side.

154
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:56,799
In my opinion,

155
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,520
you'd better get married

156
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
and settle sooner.

157
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,960
In your eyes,

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
the only way for me

159
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,760
is to marry Fan Yunxi?

160
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,880
You've been together for ten years.

161
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
Why not get married?

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,400
Who treats you better than him,

163
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,520
understands you better,

164
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,280
and has such a big enterprise?

165
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,719
In everyone's eyes,

166
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,599
we should get married.

167
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,239
But what if there are accidents

168
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,359
in our life?

169
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,559
Accidents?

170
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,159
Who has a life without accidents?

171
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,719
Why don't you just go back to the right track?

172
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,119
Is it really so?

173
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,400
Youyou.

174
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,719
Yunxi is the right person for you.

175
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,960
Isn't love the most important thing?

176
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,479
Love

177
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,559
is touching at one's 20s

178
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,200
but childish at one's 30s.

179
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,919
Marriage is spending time

180
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,280
with the right person.

181
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,840
Living well is more important than falling in love.

182
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,200
Yunxi is under so much pressure at work

183
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,880
that he has no time to give you romance,

184
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
but it doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

185
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,559
In your senior year, your high fever caused pneumonia.

186
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
In order to take care of you,

187
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,960
Yunxi gave up his most important dream,

188
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,000
PhD candidate exam for Penn University.

189
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,760
He didn't tell you about it, did he?

190
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,719
All right.

191
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,440
Think it over.

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Don't get your head around it.

193
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,479
It's late. Go to sleep.

194
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,559
Congratulations. You got amnesty card.

195
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,400
If you make my angry someday,

196
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,960
this is your immunity.

197
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,840
I told you I didn't have to sign it.

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,840
I certainly won't need it.

199
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,919
Even so, I need to show my attitude and sincerity.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,719
Here you are. Come on.

201
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,960
Put it away.

202
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,320
Put it away!

203
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,039
Today you are not too busy to see me.

204
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,760
This is the document you've asked from my dad.

205
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,039
He asked me to send it.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Please thank your dad for me.

207
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,799
And thank you for

208
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,520
what you have done for my dad.

209
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,679
That's what I should do.

210
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,960
I want to ask you something.

211
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:24,960
Go ahead.

212
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,440
You could have gone abroad

213
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,559
after graduating from postgraduate,

214
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,559
but you gave it up because of me?

215
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,440
You knew it.

216
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,280
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,559
That was my own decision.

218
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,159
If I told you,

219
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,520
it wouldn't do any good
except for putting pressure on you.

220
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,239
Actually,

221
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,760
I want to tell you something.

222
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,719
When we were in school,
I missed a very important interview

223
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,479
(Relationship Agreement: Make up to Yunxi)
to watch the sunrise with you.

224
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,640
You felt so bad about it

225
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,640
that you wrote this.

226
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,440
I promise

227
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,559
not to rescind it unilaterally

228
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,440
except for force majeure.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,880
Although we wrote it for fun,

230
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
we were very happy.

231
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,960
We thought that with this agreement,

232
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,400
(Relationship Agreement: Make up to Yunxi)
we had a guarantee for our happiness.

233
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,080
It's kind of childish now.

234
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,599
I know I was selfish.

235
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,520
I was so focused on myself

236
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,559
that I ignored a lot.

237
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,239
Now I've learned my lesson.

238
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,039
But it's too late.

239
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,080
Youyou.

240
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,919
I love you as much as I ever did,

241
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,719
but I can't push you anymore.

242
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,119
I accept the breakup.

243
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,880
This is your favorite osmanthus cake,

244
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,400
I bought it for you for the last time.

245
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,200
You still remember.

246
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,159
I remember everything

247
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,640
about you.

248
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
I need to go to the washroom.

249
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,840
Youyou

250
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,200
I love you as much as I ever did,

251
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,080
but I can't push you anymore.

252
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,799
I accept the breakup.

253
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,080
Why are you here?

254
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,200
This is my home.

255
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,960
It makes sense.

256
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,119
Actually, I'm here

257
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,960
to report on the research.

258
00:16:59,119 --> 00:16:59,880
Don't beat around the bush.

259
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,479
No, bro.

260
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,040
Not to brag.

261
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,800
I have taken the lead this month,

262
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,560
and I have figured out everything about it.

263
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,199
In Shangger,

264
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,920
Mr. Luo holds the largest share.

265
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,479
You're on a par with Mr. Han.

266
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,719
You are both chairmen.

267
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:27,680
You two report to Mr. Luo.

268
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,239
Just like three tigers.

269
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,719
I'm the third one?

270
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,680
No, you're the meat in the middle.

271
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,920
The third tiger

272
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,400
is the position of the partner of this company.

273
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,719
Mr. Han has been eyeing it for a long time.

274
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,680
At this time, Mr. Luo found you.

275
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,119
You have become

276
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,719
a thorn in the eyes of Mr. Han.

277
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,040
If you want to gain a foothold in Shangger,

278
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,359
taking Lemi is the first step.

279
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,199
Bro,

280
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
my voucher is very useful.

281
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,280
Think about it,

282
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,520
Mr. Han, your higher authority, is against us,

283
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,079
wishing us to make a mistake.

284
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,239
Fang Qi, your subordinate,

285
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,640
is obviously grudging about your position.

286
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,599
Both sides are giving you hard time.

287
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,040
But luckily,

288
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,560
I'm here

289
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,719
to help you out.

290
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,040
I highly doubt it.

291
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:22,959
Please...

292
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,680
You broke my heart.

293
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,280
I went all the way to Lemi for information.

294
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,160
I heard that Xu Qingyou, the operation director

295
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,880
who contacted us this time

296
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,199
is not easy.

297
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,040
She solved the counterfeit case.

298
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,160
No sweat.

299
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,560
She must be hard to deal with.

300
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,119
We must be careful.

301
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,239
Really?

302
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,839
Nope.

303
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,520
Why don't you believe what I said?

304
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,359
Is there something else

305
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,000
you want to tell me?

306
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,719
Like compliments.

307
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,680
Of course.

308
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,000
Keep your mouth shut while you eat.

309
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,199
There is hot food in the kitchen.

310
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,000
Don't enter my house without my permission.

311
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,479
Fang Qi.

312
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,040
Two cups of coffee.

313
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,439
OK.

314
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,959
You just got back together?

315
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,479
Not really.

316
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,239
So what is that?

317
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,079
I just

318
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,680
want to try again.

319
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,599
I don't think it's necessary.

320
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,000
But it's ten years of my life.

321
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,359
What's wrong with ten years?

322
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,439
You'd be sad to have a dog for ten years.

323
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,040
You're risking the rest of your life

324
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,439
for 10 years?

325
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,920
Just trying.

326
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,239
Maybe not even that far.

327
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,680
Your coffee.

328
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,599
Take the coffee yourself.

329
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,560
I promised him a chance

330
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,400
to forgive him

331
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,479
if he made a mistake.

332
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,160
Is it necessary to take the jokes

333
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,239
of your youth seriously?

334
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,280
Maybe others take it as a joke,

335
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,239
but I was really serious.

336
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,119
Xu Qingyou.

337
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,439
Sooner or later you'll be dragged down
by your character.

338
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,280
Do you know that?

339
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,239
We were together for ten years,

340
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,680
and we were really in love.

341
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:50,280
So?

342
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,400
We're just one step away from what

343
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,239
everyone thinks is going to happen.

344
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,160
If we fall here, he'll regret,

345
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,400
and I'll hurt.

346
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,359
You really do refuse to give up until all hope is gone.

347
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,800
Understand?

348
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,880
No matter what the result is,

349
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,239
after trying this time,

350
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,239
neither of us would regret.

351
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,079
And don't blame me.

352
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,199
No good will come of this.

353
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,040
It's only a matter of time.

354
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,359
Perhaps.

355
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,000
But I thought it for a long time,

356
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,400
we used to start so solemnly,

357
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,239
and I don't want to end it hastily.

358
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,280
Not only me

359
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,520
but also the relationship

360
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,000
deserves a try.

361
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,079
Xu Qingyou, can we just have a good chat,

362
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,760
and don't be sensational?

363
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:45,839
All right.

364
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,280
I know you care about me.

365
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,160
Thank you.

366
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,359
Thanks to Mr. Mo's support that

367
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:05,920
Lemi made a big step forward.

368
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,400
My pleasure.

369
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,760
That's my responsibility, too.

370
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,079
Getting ready to go public

371
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,280
will be an uphill battle.

372
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,839
With the help of Shangger and Mr. Mo,

373
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,079
I'm confident about the future of Lemi.

374
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,920
Lemi is now on a higher level,

375
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,119
and the next step is the key.

376
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:26,560
Now, the duty of different departments overlaps

377
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,079
and the production capacity per capita is low,

378
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,000
which is not sustainable to future development.

379
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,119
Investors want to see

380
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,319
a more mature and a better team.

381
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,079
So you mean that...

382
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,719
Optimize personnel structure.

383
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,359
But these senior employees

384
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,760
are very affectionate for Lemi,

385
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:44,920
and many of them

386
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,160
contributed a lot with me

387
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,680
in the early days of entrepreneurship.

388
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,680
So,

389
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,479
they have to consider the future of Lemi.

390
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:05,719
Mr. Mo

391
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,040
What are you doing here?

392
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,400
What's up?

393
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,079
Director Xu seems to not want to see me.

394
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,839
There's no such thing.

395
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,239
There is no want or don't want.

396
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,239
Youyou.

397
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:14,719
All right.

398
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,079
What are you doing here?

399
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,160
Why didn't you tell me?

400
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,560
I stopped by the meeting

401
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,079
and brought you some snacks for afternoon tea.

402
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,680
By the way,

403
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,119
this is Mr. Mo from Shangger.

404
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,640
Mr. Mo.

405
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,920
Nice to meet you.

406
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:37,959
Fan Yunxi.

407
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:39,920
Lawyer Fan.

408
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,079
I've heard a lot about you.

409
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,319
What is Lawyer Fan doing here?

410
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,839
Sorry, I forgot to introduce.

411
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,400
Xu Qingyou, my fiancée.

412
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,079
I see.

413
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,319
What a coincidence.

414
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,920
I'll have a meeting later,

415
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,040
you can go back first.

416
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,359
OK.

417
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:04,599
I'll pick you up after work.

418
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,280
Be careful on the way.

419
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:07,880
See you then.

420
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,520
It seems that Director Xu's acceptance of accidents in life

421
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,640
is quite well.

422
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,959
Life is made up of

423
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,400
countless accidents.

424
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,359
Isn't that what you have told me?

425
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,560
Congratulations.

426
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,400
For getting an accident-free life

427
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,680
as you wish.

428
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,319
Thanks, Mr. Mo.

429
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,760
Please don't bother for me.

430
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,280
This way, miss.

431
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,599
Director Xu, we have a visitor.

432
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,719
Thank you.

433
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,119
Hello. What can I do for you?

434
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,079
Lingze has changed his taste.

435
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,119
You

436
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,239
had better quit.

437
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:08,520
Mo Lingze only cares about me,

438
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,800
so you just give up.

439
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,800
Is there any misunderstanding?

440
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,040
Mo Lingze and I are just colleagues.

441
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,920
And even if we did,

442
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,880
you should go to him instead of me.

443
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,439
I've seen a lot of people like you, okay?

444
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,920
You think I'm gonna believe you?

445
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,520
I tell you, no way.

446
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,199
You just fell in love with Lingze's money.

447
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,199
You love his good looks,

448
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,680
and his money,

449
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,319
don't you?

450
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,719
Are you his girlfriend?

451
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm not now,

452
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,079
but I will be.

453
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,920
I'm warning you to stay away from him.

454
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,119
What are you doing? Don't pull me.

455
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,719
What's wrong?

456
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,880
Hands off me!

457
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,719
I don't know.

458
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,560
What are you doing? Let me go.

459
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,760
What are you doing?

460
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,479
You came to my company
and asked me what I want to do?

461
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,599
You mess up with my boyfriend. Can't I fight back?

462
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,040
Come on.

463
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,479
He is cool, silent, and inscrutable.

464
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,199
I'm not interested in him.

465
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,640
Don't speak ill of him!

466
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,680
What a handsome face he has.

467
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,839
If a man needs you to fight for,

468
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,439
he's not a good choice.

469
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,479
It's none of your business.

470
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Xu Qingyou.

471
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,280
This is not over.

472
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,280
Look,

473
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,599
the most important thing

474
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,079
in portrait painting is the charm of the model.

475
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,520
Now teacher Gu is

476
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,839
a girl with a pearl earring.

477
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,640
As for your painting,

478
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,000
people who don't know the truth may think

479
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
it is an old sow with earrings.

480
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,079
Xu Wei, I warn you that

481
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,959
there are so many students,

482
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,199
be careful with your diction.

483
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,239
Otherwise, our ten-year friendship

484
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,359
will end here.

485
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,439
OK, OK, OK.

486
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,959
Be nice in front of the class.

487
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,400
Yes.

488
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,719
Guys, take it seriously.

489
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,079
Look at me.

490
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,920
Look, my students.

491
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,800
Come in.

492
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,119
Mr. Mo.

493
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,959
Here is the file from Mr. Zhai.

494
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,640
What's the matter with your foot?

495
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,160
Just a sprain.

496
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,400
If there is nothing wrong, I will get off work.

497
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,239
Wait a minute.

498
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,479
I'll be responsible if it's a work injury.

499
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,680
Mr. Mo, you do have a responsibility,

500
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
but not to me.

501
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,959
I hope you can take care of your personal affairs

502
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,959
and not bring trouble to others.

503
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,959
What are you doing?

504
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,319
Go to the doctor.

505
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,599
No, thank you.

506
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,719
It'll be all right in a few days.

507
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,119
Go.

508
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,680
I'll do it myself.

509
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:27,839
Still hurts?

510
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,839
Sorry.

511
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,000
I knew what has happened.

512
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,760
I have warned Lin Siyu,

513
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,800
and she will not bother you anymore.

514
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,040
It's nothing.

515
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,160
I fought back anyway.

516
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,239
Hi, Yunxi.

517
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,920
Still working?

518
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:57,880
No.

519
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,640
I sprained my ankle. I'm in the hospital.

520
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,199
How did you get hurt?

521
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,199
Is it severe?

522
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,719
It doesn't matter. I have taken care of it.

523
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,880
I'll pick you up as soon as I'm done.

524
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,160
OK.

525
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,760
Thank you.

526
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,079
My boyfriend will pick me up.

527
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:23,920
And you

528
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,680
can go home and take a good rest.

529
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,479
Director Xu repeatedly

530
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:33,920
stressed boundaries in front of me.

531
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,040
Are you guilty?

532
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:39,599
There's nothing to be guilty of.

533
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
I was just telling the truth.

534
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,160
OK.

535
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,680
Just wait for your boyfriend.

536
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,119
Hello,

537
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,199
the subscriber you dialed is busy now.

538
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,640
Hello,

539
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,000
the subscriber you dialed is busy now,

540
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,599
please redial later.

541
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,119
Youyou.

542
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,400
Please wait for a second,

543
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,280
I have something to deal with,

544
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,680
I will pick you up as soon as I'm done.

545
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:25,959
It's okay, you are busy.

546
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,959
I happen to be with my colleague

547
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,319
and he will send me back.

548
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,280
(Taxi hailing. Will hail  one in 46 mins)

549
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Maybe 10 p.m.

550
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,160
is the real evening rush hour for overtime workers.

551
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,599
Where's your boyfriend?

552
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,959
Are you going to get one right now?

553
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,479
He'll be here soon.
