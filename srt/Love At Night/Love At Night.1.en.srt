Hello.

4
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,400
Hello.

5
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,639
This is hotel reception.

6
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,919
Mr. Mo has booked

7
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,120
a wake-up call for you at eight o'clock.

8
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,279
Mr. Mo?

9
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,370
( One day ago)

10
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,240
I am Xu Qingyou,

11
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,600
the Director of the Operation Department Ⅰ of Lemi.

12
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,119
I'm going to be 30.

13
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,240
It is said that

14
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,399
time will put an invisible shackle

15
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,119
on 30-year-old women.

16
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,720
It makes them obsessed with keeping young forever.

17
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:29,000
It makes them careful about every choice.

18
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,559
What should a 30-year-old woman look like?

19
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,160
My answer is...

20
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
Any look that satisfies yourself.

21
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,380
(Fan Yunxi)

22
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,600
What's the matter?

23
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,800
Why did you call me so early?

24
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,440
You started to work so early.

25
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,039
Since you work so hard,

26
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,639
why don't we hold the wedding in advance?

27
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,279
You can quit your job and be Mrs. Fan.

28
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,119
And I don't have to stay in the hotel anymore.

29
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,320
You are the breadwinner

30
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,399
and bear a heavy burden.

31
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,199
I earn my own living to share the responsibility for you.

32
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,360
Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,200
At the mention of quit, you will change the subject.

34
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,559
Isn't it women's dream to enjoy the fruits of others

35
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,839
without having toiled?

36
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,600
No.

37
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
That's men's erroneous assumption.

Xu Qingyou.

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,880
The external advertising

44
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,239
is clearly the responsibility of the Department Ⅱ.

45
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,799
Why was the plan of the Department Ⅰ chosen?

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,959
Because the exposure of your channel is low

47
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,839
but the cost is too high.

48
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,160
Who approved it?

49
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,880
Who made you to do these

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,839
messy gimmicks?

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,679
Let's talk about it in the company.

52
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,239
See you later.

( Wang Ji calling）

54
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:10,920
Hello, Mr. Mo.

55
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,920
Our project

56
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,160
was robbed by Zhao Lei

57
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,920
of Golden Sun Capital,
your former employer.

58
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,200
He is going to Jia Weisi

59
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,239
with the investment agreement now.

60
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,880
Don't worry. He can't do it.

61
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,399
To meet at the location.

62
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,279
Mr. Mo.

63
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,239
We searched the whole street for Jia Weisi,

64
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,959
but failed.

65
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,040
He is a genius coder.

66
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,119
But, in life, he is a super otaku.

67
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,600
He has breakfast in this street

68
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,519
at 8:30 every day.

69
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,160
I confirmed it.

70
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,160
Hello, Mr. Zhai.

71
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,359
Qingyou, you asked the Technical Department

72
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,040
to temporarily change the plan into

73
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,519
your plan today, right?

74
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,760
Do you know

75
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,959
-the people in the Department Ⅱ...  -Hello, Mr. Zhai?

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,279
I seem to be in a bad reception area.

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Hello? Can you hear me?

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,239
Hello?

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
Are you all right?

80
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm fine.

81
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,799
Did I just step on your foot?

82
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,399
No.

83
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,359
-I'm sorry.  -Jia Weisi.

84
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm fine.

85
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,440
Let me deal with it for you.

87
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,880
That's okay.

88
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,239
So let me buy a new one for you.

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,279
Give me your Wechat  number.

90
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,440
Drama queen.

91
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,000
It's too old-fashioned.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,640
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,570
(Cards)

94
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,880
Enjoy yourself.

95
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,119
Thank you.

96
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,000
Guys,

97
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,000
I only

98
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,480
care about one thing now.

99
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,480
Which of you can

100
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
give me the investment funds first?

101
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you know what situation it is now?

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,239
It's capital winter.

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,279
For startups like ours,

104
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,839
every minute is very important to us.

105
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,720
You are right.

106
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,480
Have a look, Mr. Jia.

107
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,160
This is the investment agreement
of Golden Sun Capital.

108
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,000
There is absolutely no imparity clause in it.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,920
As long as you stamp it,

110
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,320
we can complete the whole process soon.

111
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,959
Sign the agreement without due diligence?

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,880
Are you sure the investment can be paid?

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,920
Of course.

114
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,640
It only takes one month,

115
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,079
one and a half months at most,

116
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,200
and the funds will definitely arrive.

117
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,519
Your products are highly homogeneous

118
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,519
and over-reliant on

119
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,679
a single third-party distribution and payment channel.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,839
You have no awareness of risk diversification at all.

121
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,239
How can I give you

122
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,640
my investment with confidence?

123
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:03,839
Umm...

124

( Project Cooperation Plan)

126
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,720
Just a piece of paper?

127
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,079
Mr. Mo, I have to say that

128
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,839
you are fooling him.

129
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,119
I think you misdirected your energies.

130
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,519
Just come to the point.

131
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,959
There is no need for nonsense.

132
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,440
This plan contains everything you need.

133
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,320
It is enough to represent
the sincerity of Shangger Capital.

134
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,119
Mr. Mo.

135
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,880
You are not what you used to be.

136
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,119
You think you can be a partner

137
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,400
because Mr. Lin's daughter likes you?

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,039
What I didn't expect is that

139
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,559
you still make a living in a small company.

140
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,880
You are overqualified for this job.

141
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,919
I am not interested in

142
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,000
being a partner,

143
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,440
but interested in leading Shangger to surpass Gold Sun

144
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,119
to become the best investment company of TMT track

145
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,679
in the shortest time.

146
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:51,799
Mr. Zhao.

147
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
Don't be too nervous.

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,119
You...

149
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,320
Mr. Jia.

150
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,159
Take your time to read the plan.

151
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,280
You can contact me at any time.

152
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,039
See you later.

153
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:00,719
OK.

154
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,239
Mr. Jia.

155
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:03,679
This is...

156
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,159
Your favorite cartoon.

157
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,280
Mr. Mo specially asked the author to sign for you.

158
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,359
He said you'd like it.

159
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,880
Please thank Mr. Mo for me.

160
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,640
I like it very much.

161
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,440
Ninety percent of accounts
receivable in the current period.

162
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,880
Seventy percent of prepayments.

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,520
Director Long.

164
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,679
As long as we finish one more order,

165
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,559
our performance in this quarter

166
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,039
will definitely surpass that of the Department Ⅰ.

167
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,919
Good job.

168
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,679
Director Long.

169
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,080
We have a meeting in the meeting room at ten.

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
How much longer do you need?

171
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,239
It will take a while.

172
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,000
And,

173
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,159
for your performance this month,

174
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,559
it won't take long for you to meet.

175
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,119
Xia Meng,

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,039
Director Xu

177
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,479
seems to be resigning as a lawyer's wife soon.

178
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,679
She's going to enjoy herself.

179
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,159
Why don't you follow me

180
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,479
and do chores for me?

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,479
That's a good idea.

182
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:01,559
You...

183
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,679
Just  keep daydreaming.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,960
Don't laugh out loud.

185
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,039
Or your face will hurt.

186
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,359
As for advertising,

187
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,760
it is because your department's plan

188
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,000
failed the online test,

189
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,320
while ours passed.

190
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,479
What's the matter?

191
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,440
Are you so eager to pass the buck?

192
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,599
I'll revise the plan if it fails.

193
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,880
It's none of your business.

194
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,159
The plans of the DepartmentⅠand the Department Ⅱ

195
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,919
have been given to the Technical Department.

196
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
The Technical Department said that

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,440
whoever passes the online test

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
will be adopted.

199
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,640
Any problem?

200
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:31,679
Right.

201
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,960
It was decided at the previous meeting.

202
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,719
There is a recording of the meeting.

203
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,640
We can replay it to confirm.

204
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,599
So the misunderstanding between us is caused by

205
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,159
the untimely transmission of information.

206
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,359
Director Long.

207
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,679
You are really good at shirking responsibility.

208
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,039
Remind you that

209
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,559
we will have a meeting in the meeting room at ten.

210
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Please hurry up.

211
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,640
By the way.

212
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,599
Garbage should be classified.

213
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,080
Thank you.

214
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,359
Take some time to get this done.

215
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,000
Our employer, Shangger,

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,520
has a new vice president.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,359
He has been in the investment field for nearly ten years,

218
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,840
with keen insight and market control.

219
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
I heard that he will be responsible for

220
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,119
Lemi's round C financing.

221
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,159
I wonder if he is handsome.

222
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,080
Do you know what his character is?

223
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,640
Strict? Gentle?

224
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,280
A bossy president or a warm man?

225
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,760
Both are fine.

226
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,239
None of your business.

227
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,280
Let's worry about our performance first.

228
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,880
Let's get to work.

229
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,359
Qingyou,

230
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,440
Long Jin

231
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,919
is getting more and more arrogant.

232
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,679
He took it for granted
that he was the general manager.

233
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,239
Doesn't he know that you may also become general manager?

234
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,359
That pisses me off!

235
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,919
Don't be angry.

236
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,400
Qingyou.

237
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,559
They all said you were going to quit your job

238
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,640
and be a rich lady.

239
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,679
Really?

240
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,840
I will be a rich lady,

241
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,000
and I will continue to work.

242
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,119
I'm greedy.

243
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,559
I know you hate to part with me.

244
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,679
That's it.

245
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,880
-OK.  -All right.

246
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,250
( Fake cosmetics of Lemi)

247
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,679
Qingyou, something terrible happens.

248
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:07,760
What's the matter?

249
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,599
There are fake cosmetics of Lemi.

250
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,719
Weibo published dozens of

251
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:16,919
online famous cosmetics inspection reports of Lemi.

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,320
After inspection, they are fakes.

253
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,039
(They are so malicious)
Look.

254
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,599
(This kind of websites should be banned)
I bought cosmetics in Lemi for two years.

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,200
(I even recommended it to friends)
Today's news said there were fakes in it.

256
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,760
(Yes,)
You know,

257
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,039
(I regretted buying lots of cosmetics on it)
something happened to Lemi.

258
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,359
Don't reply.

259
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,799
Before the official announcement,

260
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,159
no one is allowed to disclose any negative information

261
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,280
about the company to the media.

262
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,479
Hurry up.

263
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,159
Let's go.

264
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,919
Hurry up to get this straightened out.

265
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,400
Hurry up.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,599
Mr. Zhai.

267
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,479
As we approach the mid-year sale,

268
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,119
rumors of fakes are sure to

269
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:47,960
affect sales by generating negative emotion.

270
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,640
At this critical time,

271
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,919
it must have been done by our competitors.

272
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,919
Beauty makeup has always been handled
by our department.

273
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,239
I will contact the whistleblower soon

274
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,239
to solve the crisis of public opinion.

275
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,479
Shangger just changed the vice president
in charge of us.

276
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,440
At this critical time,

277
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,799
nothing can go wrong again.

278
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,960
I see.

279
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,280
Xu Qingyou, look.

280
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,760
Let me tell you that

281
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,799
Fan Yunxi is a playboy.

282
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
(Calling Honey)

283
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,900
(Honey calling)

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,039
Hello.

285
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,559
Let's have dinner together in the evening.

286
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,440
I booked the couple restaurant

287
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,840
you always wanted to go to.

288
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,760
Youyou?

289
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,799
OK, see you tonight.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,520
Dong Bao.

291
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,760
Contact the whistleblower.

292
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,960
Then try to communicate with him.

293
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:30,320
OK.

294
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,799
Xia Meng.

295
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,840
Verify the purchase records.

296
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:32,520
Yu Ming.

297
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,799
Prepare a lawyer's letter.

298
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,200
OK.

299
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,559
Xiaopang.

300
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,599
Contact the brand department

301
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,280
to prepare PR.

302
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:36,840
OK.

303
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,599
Youyou.

304
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,679
Why don't we hold the wedding in advance?

305
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,039
You can quit your job and be Mrs. Fan.

306
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,559
Youyou.

307
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,719
I don't make excuses for myself.

308
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,440
Although I drank too much that day

309
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,239
and couldn't remember anything,

310
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,719
I was really wrong.

311
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,919
Youyou.

312
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,960
My heart only belongs to you.

313
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,039
I will give you a happy life.

314
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,520
Trust me.

315
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,760
You cheated on me three months before marriage.

316
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,559
Trust you?

317
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:11,799
Look.

318
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,479
I saw it.

319
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,280
That woman is great.

320
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,919
Let me have a look.

321
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,239
Hello.

322
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,479
Director Xu.

323
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,760
I have submitted the company's delivery plan

324
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,119
for next month to the Technical Department

325
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,880
and copied it to Mr. Zhai.

326
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,799
Please give me a break.

327
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
Lady, con...

328
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,000
The company is in such a big crisis.

329
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,719
You still have a party?

330
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,239
You don't care

331
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,640
because you are going to marry a rich man, right?

332
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,559
I'll open a bottle of champagne

333
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,280
to wish your Department II
to be back in the saddle.

334
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,000
Xu Qing...

335
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,000
What's the matter?

336
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,359
Miss,

337
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,559
you

338
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,840
broke the record

339
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,520
of our bar since it opened.

340
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,319
You are the God of War.

341
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,719
Really?

342
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,280
Do I look like Athena?

343
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,079
You're Athena.

344
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,239
Let me tell you,

345
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,280
there is a rule in our bar.

346
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
The record-breaker has the right

347
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,719
to make a request

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,920
to the previous record holder.

349
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,040
You

350
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,640
broke Mo's record.

351
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,719
He's here, a handsome guy.

352
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,239
The new God of War. Your record was broken.

353
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,280
You're weak now.

354
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,479
Sorry.

355
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,839
You can make a request.

356
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,319
Anything is OK.

357
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,680
Miss, we're closing.

358
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,839
Please settle the account first.

359
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,319
OK, just a moment.

360
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,319
Miss,

361
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,479
can I call your honey

362
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,719
and ask him

363
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,719
to pick you up?

364
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,599
No, you can't.

365
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,160
Umm...

366
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,719
You threw it.

367
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,680
It has nothing to do with me.

368
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:46,640
It's okay.

369
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
It's okay if it is broken.

370
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,640
Mo...

371
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,359
It's okay. Leave it to me.

372
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,520
Thank you, Mo.

373
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
You're number two.

374
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,920
Miss,

375
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,400
please behave yourself.

376
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,359
Where's my lip print?

377
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,959
You bosses like to find something to carp about.

378
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,280
Don't worry.

379
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,079
Let me get you another one.

380
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,479
Perfect.

381
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,239
A perfect new lip print.

382
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,119
A new lip print.

383
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,359
Ouch.

384
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,119
Don't forget that

385
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,920
I have the right to ask you

386
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,520
to do anything.

387
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,280
Right?

388
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,439
Don't look at me.

389
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,280
I can't help you.

390
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,760
The rule of the bar is that bet is bet.

391
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,560
Bet is bet.

392
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:08,239
Tonight, obey my order.

393
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,400
Where do you live?

394
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,680
Let me take you back.

395
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,479
Why do you ask this?

396
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,839
If you don't tell me,

397
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,920
I'll have to hand you over to the police.

398
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,199
Well.

399
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,040
Let me tell you a secret.

400
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,599
I, Xu Qingyou,

401
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:52,640
learned today that the perfect boyfriend

402
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,079
I've loved

403
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,760
for ten years

404
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,920
cheated on me.

405
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,719
I used to think

406
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,599
I wouldn't lose

407
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,680
what I had.

408
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,079
But now I realize that

409
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,199
actually people

410
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,239
are not so lucky.

411
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,000
Right?

412
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,119
Miss Xu.

413
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,719
I don't care about your relationship status.

414
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:36,880
At this moment,

415
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,000
all I care about is your personal safety.

416
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,439
Let's flip a coin.

417
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,400
If it's face up, I'll take you home.

418
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,880
If it's upside down, I'll hand you over to the police.

419
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,640
Upside down.

420
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,599
Hand you over to the police.

421
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,119
Face up.

422
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,239
The side with numbers is the front.

423
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,359
The patterned side is the reverse one.

424
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,239
This is common sense.

425
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,479
I don't understand.

426
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:26,889
I don't wanna go home.

427
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:40,079
It's a deal.

428
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,160
Take your time.

429
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,479
Hello, Director Xu.

430
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,400
Morning.

431
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,520
Good morning, Director Xu.

432
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,959
Morning.

433
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:56,959
Director Xu.

434
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:57,560
Morning.

435
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,160
Qingyou.

436
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,119
There is feedback from after-sales service.

437
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,520
They said that the invoice and authorization code

438
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,280
provided by the whistleblower had confirmed that

439
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,040
his purchase record was true.

440
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,199
Contact the whistleblower

441
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,560
to see what he wants.

442
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,920
Be safe when negotiating.

443
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,479
Let me know as soon as something bad happens.

444
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,199
OK.

445
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:11,640
Go for it.

446
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,600
( Youyou, please listen to my explanation.
I really love you)

447
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,199
I need to break my bad habits.

448
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,199
Princess Xu.

449
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,800
Your takeout is here.

450
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,040
You had a showdown with Fan Yunxi?

451
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,599
You broke up?

452
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
You were persuaded by Fan Yunxi's

453
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,079
superb negotiation skills again?

454
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,640
No.

455
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,520
I just need a little time

456
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
to let me leave him firmly.

457
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,079
Xu Qingyou.

458
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,560
If a man betrays you once,
he will betray you countless times.

459
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,199
As long as he makes one mistake,
he will keep making mistakes.

460
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:38,760
He'll be addicted to

461
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,800
betraying you.

462
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,040
If they hadn't posted

463
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,479
photos of the party in the WeChat group,

464
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,119
I wouldn't have

465
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,599
happened to see it.

466
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,640
Hello, Meng.

467
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,359
Hello, Qingyou.

468
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,920
The whistleblower said that he had to

469
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
meet with the leader.

470
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,000
I really can't communicate with him.

471
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,079
I really can't help it.

472
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,079
Wait for me.

473
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Sorry, I really need to go now.

474
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,160
Don't you eat?

475
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,199
No.

476
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:07,800
Enjoy yourself.

477
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,199
Are you all right?

478
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,680
Is this your condition?

479
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,239
Delete the video.

480
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,199
Apologize publicly.

481
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,119
Why should I listen to you?

482
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,680
You have 16 Weibo accounts.

483
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,920
Since 2015,

484
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,000
you have been using
these 16 seemingly unrelated accounts

485
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,560
to do one thing

486
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,760
that is to disclose the products of various enterprises

487
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:35,880
and ask them for compensation.

488
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,199
In these years,

489
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,359
you disclosed the news about nearly 20 companies.

490
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,239
If I'm not wrong,

491
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,719
you rely exclusively on

492
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,239
blackmail for profit, right?

493
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
They are willing to pay compensation,

494
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,839
which shows that they have a guilty conscience.

495
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm enforcing justice on behalf of Heaven.

496
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,040
It's not shameful.

497
00:28:59,239 --> 00:28:59,800
Really?

498
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,680
It seems that you have chosen the wrong company.

499
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,560
Lemi has a clear conscience.

500
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,079
I have recorded

501
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,280
all of our conversations.

502
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,319
When the time comes, I'll hand it over to the court along with the evidence.

503
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,239
Regarding the issue of fake products,

504
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,199
Lemi is willing to accept all investigations.

505
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,319
You must follow the news

506
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,959
to monitor us

507
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,520
if you go to jail.

508
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,239
You...

509
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
This coffee tastes good.

510
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,280
Don't waste it.

511
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,000
Meng, let's go.

512
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:23,760
OK.

513
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,599
Take your time.

514
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:33,280
Mr. Zhai,

515
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,079
I believe he will accept my terms

516
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,239
to clear Lemi's name.

517
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,520
The new vice president of Shangger is very strict

518
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:39,520
and pays close attention to this matter.

519
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,599
Come back quickly

520
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,760
and give him a report.

521
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,160
OK.

522
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:48,800
I didn't expect that he specialized in blackmail.

523
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,719
But to be honest,

524
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,239
his unboxing video

525
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,520
is really good.

526
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,400
Meng.

527
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,599
You found out earlier that

528
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,319
his purchase records were true, right?

529
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,280
Yes.

530
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,079
He filmed the whole process

531
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,079
from unboxing to inspection.

532
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:04,719
Well.

533
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,839
You go back to the company

534
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,160
to ask colleagues in the Technical Department

535
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,000
to check the authenticity of the unboxing video.

536
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
I have a place to go.

537
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:11,640
OK.

538
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,199
Sir.

539
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,760
Please pull over.

540
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,880
OK.

541
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:51,880
Welcome.

542
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,880
Welcome, Mr. Mo of Shangger.

543
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,599
Manager Wang, Manager Fang.

544
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,079
Sorry for the inconvenience.

545
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,239
I'm sorry.

546
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,880
I'm busy dealing with

547
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,839
the negative news of the company these days.

548
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,319
Very upset.

549
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,760
I heard that all the staff of Lemi

550
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
are dealing with this matter urgently.

551
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,760
As the investor in Lemi,

552
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,439
we will certainly do our best to help you.

553
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,239
You said you'd give me feedback in three days.

554
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,839
How's it going?

555
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,680
We are duty-bound to pay our concern about this.

556
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,119
Mr. Mo, well.

557
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,119
Let me show you around the company first,

558
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,640
and then we'll talk in detail.

559
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,439
Please.

560
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,040
This is the core operation department of our company,

561
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,520
including the Department Ⅰ and the Department Ⅱ.

562
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:33,359
This is the reception area and leisure area.

563
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,400
That's the Technical Department.

564
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,880
This is Director Xu's office cubicle.

565
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,280
Director Xu?

566
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,880
Right.

567
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,680
She is in charge of this fake crisis.

568
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,959
Bet is bet.

569
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:57,599
Tonight, obey my order.

570
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Come on, Mr. Mo, this way.

571
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:04,680
OK.

572
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,599
Mr. Zhai.

573
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,359
The reason why Shangger invested in Lemi

574
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,199
is the development potential of Lemi

575
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:12,160
in the e-commerce industry.

576
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,280
As the investor,

577
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,920
I am concerned about risk.

578
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,680
Now the negative news of Lemi

579
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,959
has seriously affected its market valuation.

580
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,479
So I think

581
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,040
the investment value of Lemi

582
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,959
should be reevaluated.

583
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,479
Why haven't you come yet?

584
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,199
Our new vice president is waiting for you
to give a report.

585
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,599
Mr. Mo.

586
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,479
Please believe that

587
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,359
Lemi will save the day.

588
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:35,520
We have drawn up three verification schemes this time.

589
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,760
Director Xu suggested starting with the person who disclosed the news.

590
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:39,400
This is

591
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,319
the most straightforward and efficient way.

592
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,239
Sorry, I'm late.

593
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,079
Let me introduce her.

594
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,239
This is Director Xu,

595
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,719
the person in charge of this fake crisis.

596
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,199
Hello, Director Xu.

597
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:00,959
Hello.

598
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:02,880
Xiaopang.

599
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,760
Play the video.

600
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,520
Please watch the video.

601
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,439
This is the video released by the whistleblower.

602
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,880
This is...

603
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,400
Look at this surprise.

604
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:24,599
It has no lid.

605
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,479
What a surprise.

606
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,959
Lemi's product?

607
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,719
After verification by the Technical Department,

608
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,640
this video has not been edited.

609
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,079
So it's true.

610
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,760
Since there is no problem

611
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,880
from unboxing to inspection,

612
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,239
there is only one doubt:

613
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:38,719
warehouse.

614
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,199
This is the surveillance video of Lemi warehouse

615
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,640
restored by the Technical Department.

616
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,800
Please have a look.

617
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,000
The whistleblower

618
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,760
seems to have done a good job.

619
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,640
The purchase record and item number are authentic.

620
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,199
But this video

621
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,280
shows that the warehouse keeper changed the products.

622
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,680
The whistleblower also admitted it.

623
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,920
I asked him to make a statement

624
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,160
to apologize to Lemi publicly,

625
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:04,319
otherwise we will take legal action.

626
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,479
Mr. Zhai.

627
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,439
Wang Dachuan, the warehouse keeper, has an employment relationship with the whistleblower.

628
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,239
He secretly changed the product.

629
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,239
His previous poor consumption record

630
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,600
caused him to incur heavy debts.

631
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
In order to repay his debts,

632
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,879
he chose this desperate way.

633
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,280
Now he has brought

634
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,919
great loss of interests to the company.

635
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,080
As for what to do with him,

636
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,479
it's up to you.

637
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,080
He apologized.

638
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,760
The whistleblower apologized.

639
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,399
He has apologized to our company

640
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,719
by posting a video on Weibo.

641
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,639
Qingyou, good job.

642
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,719
Thank you, Mr. Zhai.

643
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,879
Thank you all.

644
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,239
Qingyou, see Mr. Mo off.

645
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,000
OK.

646
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,399
Mr. Mo, this way, please.

647
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,199
Director Xu.

648
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,000
You look familiar to me.

649
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,439
But I don't know where I've seen you.

650
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,239
Really?

651
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,760
You got the wrong person.

652
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:31,520
Maybe... Have you seen me?

653
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,040
No.

654
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,239
Director Xu.

655
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:48,439
You haven't paid me the fee
for hotel accommodation yet.
