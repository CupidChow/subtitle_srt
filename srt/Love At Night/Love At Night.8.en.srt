00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,510
Hello, are you the manager, Mr. Liao?

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,400
Yes, that's me.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,190
Hello.

6
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
And you are?

7
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,950
I am Xu Qingyou from Lemi.

8
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,870
Here's my card.

9
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,480
Are you Director Xu?

10
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

11
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,480
Thanks for helping out with the photocopies.

12
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,440
Please come in.

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,950
Okay.

（Binhai Runda Print Company)

15
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,270
Do you want to print posters?

16
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,160
Right.

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,800
There are no posters inside your USB.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,910
It's full of text files.

19
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,080
I might have mixed it up. Please wait.

20
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,960
You took the wrong one.

21
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,240
It should be this one.

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,030
Okay, I'll try this.

23
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,750
Why are you here?

24
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,160
Aren't you about to call me?

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,750
Thank you.

26
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,960
You're welcome.

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,960
I came to get my own stuff.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,080
It's right this time.

29
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,630
But,

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,390
since your print volume is large,

31
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,670
it might take a while.

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,160
Are you okay today?

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,550
What?

34
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,750
Do you mean I bumped into that person?

35
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,030
It's been many years.

36
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,320
I'm okay.

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,190
It's over for me.

38
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,270
Don't you blame me for acting on my own?

39
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,360
No, why would I blame you?

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,910
I even want to praise you.

41
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,600
You did a great job today.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,270
You made me proud.

43
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,960
Alright then.

44
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,080
Get some rest.

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,030
Bye.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,270
Don't worry.

47
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,270
I asked them already.

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,110
Everything will be done by 8 a.m. tomorrow.

49
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,920
Get in, I'll take you home.

50
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,350
Thank you.

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,510
I'll wait here.

52
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,440
It's up to you.

53
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,200
(Divorce: Qu Kai, Fang Qi. May 5th, 2013)

54
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,670
Okay.

55
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,480
That's it.

56
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,270
I'll call you when we need to
go to the Bureau of Civil Affairs.

57
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,230
If you need me, just let me know.

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,760
I'll help whatever I can.

59
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,320
I understand.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
We still are friends after the divorce.

61
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,160
I have work to do.

62
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,320
Bye.

63
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,110
Lei,

64
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,320
didn't you say

65
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
you want to introduce a college classmate to me?

66
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,000
I think...

67
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,670
He got married in such a short time?

68
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,550
It happened too fast.

69
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,390
Alright. Bye.

70
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Seriously? That quick?

71
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,510
Oh, there's another one.

72
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,720
Hello, Yulin?

73
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Yeah, it's me.

74
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,270
I remember that

75
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,320
you want to introduce

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,040
a director to me.

77
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,350
Mr. Pan?

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,790
Oh, yeah.

79
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh, he's not considering anymore?

80
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,110
Alright.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,270
Forget it.

82
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,950
The air is so good in the countryside.

83
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,270
I'm going to work here today.

84
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,830
I'm not cold.

85
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,480
I feel hot, okay?

86
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,640
Thank you

87
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,720
for today.

88
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,880
My pleasure, Director Xu.

89
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,830
I told you before...

90
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,790
Director Xu, don't worry.

91
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,550
I promised that

92
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,720
I would keep a distance.

93
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
The air is so good here.

94
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,400
Look up at the stars.

95
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
I haven't seen so many stars for long.

96
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,710
Yeah.

97
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,350
The last time I looked at stars was in childhood.

98
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,280
My mom took me to the countryside.

99
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,440
The sky was filled with stars.

100
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,350
So you looked at the stars all night long?

101
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,350
No.

102
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,550
I was busy catching fireflies

103
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,150
and I accidentally fell into the river.

104
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
I was soaked.

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,710
It's your style.

106
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,440
You were naughty in childhood.

107
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,280
I never thought that

108
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,280
I won't get a chance like that anymore.

109
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,550
You're different from usual.

110
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
What's the difference?

111
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,030
I got it.

112
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,110
Director Xu ate four stuffed buns,

113
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,000
and I ate nothing.

114
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,710
I asked you before.

115
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,080
Didn't you say you don't feel like eating?

116
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Hello, Xia Meng.

117
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,470
We got them already.

118
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,880
Tell the advertising agency to wait a little longer.

119
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
Keep in contact.

120
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
Didn't you rest well yesterday?

121
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,030
I was too busy looking at the stars.

122
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,150
I didn't sleep much.

123
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,910
Want a candy?

124
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,960
It'll wake you up.

125
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,110
This part of the proposal should be adjusted.

126
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,520
It's not explicit enough.

127
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,590
Okay, wait a minute.

128
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,520
Qi.

129
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,880
Have a look.

130
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,790
(Shoulder Bag: 12000 RMB)
The luxury industry?

131
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,880
This bag is 12,000 RMB.

132
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,550
What is it made of?

133
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,230
They can skin me to make a bag

134
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,550
but it is still not worth 12,000 RMB.

135
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,550
Of course your skin isn't worth 12,000 RMB.

136
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,350
But this logo is worth.

137
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
You eat lunch at convenient store every day.

138
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,760
No wonder you won't understand Select Shop.

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,670
You have to find one target customer

140
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,590
to hear more about it.

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,150
A lot of money was spent to gain such an experience.

142
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,080
It's better than your theories.

143
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,640
Target customer?

144
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,440
The CEO of Golden Sun Capital,
Mr. Lin, is my father.

145
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,350
Enjoy.

146
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,790
Thank you.

147
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,110
This isn't hot anymore. Here.

148
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,400
I spent 0.3 million on that shop
for a due diligence report,

149
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,350
asking for information.

150
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,320
Now you just spent 30 yuan
to buy me a bowl of noodles.

151
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,200
We have different income levels.
I can only afford this.

152
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,790
Wang Ji,

153
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,880
as an investment manager,

154
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
your salary won't be that low.

155
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,030
Yes, it isn't that low.

156
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,550
But

157
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm paying for my mom's dialysis.

158
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,150
I still have a little sister

159
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,520
whose tuition fee costs quite a lot.

160
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,230
I haven't eaten noodles for 30 yuan yet.

161
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,280
Let me try.

162
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,110
I want to thank you.

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,790
You always say that, you don't mean it.

164
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,840
Tell me, what can I do for you?

165
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,550
I would help you the best I can.

166
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,760
I don't really need anything,

167
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,640
except...

168
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Except Mr. Mo.

169
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,320
Your boss is too hard to approach,

170
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,280
regardless of how much money I spent on him.

171
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,200
You're not thinking it in the right way.

172
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,840
You need strategies to get a man back.

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,150
How could you rely on the money?

174
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,110
But the only thing I have is money.

175
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,320
Mr. Mo

176
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,880
could be quite stubborn sometimes.

177
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,590
While,

178
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,030
he has been friends with Sa for many years.

179
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,150
They are good friends.

180
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,230
I think

181
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,760
you should start with Mr. Mo's friends.

182
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,030
You can use the empathy of women,

183
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,200
and swallow your pride.

184
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,110
Who knows? She might help you.

185
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,110
Swallow my pride.

186
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,910
You're right.

187
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,320
Good for you.

188
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Nice.

189
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,350
You can work towards this goal.

190
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,350
(Department I: Bus ads confirmed. Online videos done.
It's trending. Thank you, guys.)

191
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,590
Look at this advertisement for Meeting Your Match.

192
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,550
It's good.

193
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,960
Qingyou.

194
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,440
After the first round of virus videos,

195
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,590
Lemi's Baidu Index

196
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,150
increased 23 percent.

197
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,840
Qingyou.

198
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
I have another piece of good news

199
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,110
to tell everyone.

200
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,910
Today,

201
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,880
we are at Microblog's top 10 hot searches three times.

202
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,760
Three times?

203
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes.

204
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,350
Another piece of good news.

205
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,840
Stay calm.

206
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,470
The replies to our discussion of Meeting Your Match

207
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,400
have exceeded a hundred million.

208
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,640
A hundred million?

209
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,200
Qingyou.

210
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,000
Our WeChat Index has exceeded two hundred thousand.

211
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,150
Two hundred thousand?

212
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,960
Two hundred thousand!

213
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,910
Colleagues in the sales department sent data feedback.

214
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,550
Look.

215
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,000
After releasing the video for three days,

216
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,840
there is a 50% year-on-year growth on the sales volume.

217
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,590
Fifty percent?

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,440
Alright, alright.

219
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,960
Everyone,

220
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,110
we can start to write the report on the first phase.

221
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,640
After you're done,

222
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,030
I'll ask Mr. Zhai for a reward.

223
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
Thanks, Qingyou.

224
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,280
Alright, let's do our best.

225
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,910
Come on.

226
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,320
Alright, let's go.

227
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,710
Keep it up.

228
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,230
Why are you here?

229
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,590
You didn't tell me before.

230
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,150
My mom came over.

231
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,880
Youyou.

232
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,520
This is a nice restaurant.

233
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,520
Look at me, I almost forgot.

234
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,470
Qingyou.

235
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,830
I made this fish noodle myself.

236
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,350
I made it the traditional way.

237
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,640
It's very healthy.

238
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,230
Take this back home.

239
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,880
Okay.

240
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,400
From now on, don't eat too many takeaways.

241
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,350
It's bad for your health.

242
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,800
Thank you.

243
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,070
Mom, we're not married yet.

244
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,070
You're being so partial already.

245
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,160
What would happen to me once we are married?

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Shut your mouth.

247
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,470
Youyou, have you set the date for the wedding?

248
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,070
Mom.

249
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,710
We're a bit busy lately.

250
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,230
We're not in a rush to get married.

251
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,760
But I'm worried.

252
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,280
I'll have a daughter if Qingyou marries early.

253
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,590
Qingyou.

254
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,680
We're not a rich family.

255
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,710
We're lucky that

256
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,310
you and your dad don't mind.

257
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,590
For many years,

258
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,920
you've stood by Yunxi.

259
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,560
You're the reason why he is what he is today.

260
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,710
It has been a long journey for you two.

261
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,590
I should thank you.

262
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,560
Auntie,

263
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,280
we don't need these polite words.

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,710
It's been ten years.

265
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,640
Thank you for your tolerance,

266
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,430
Youyou.

267
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,470
I know my son.

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
He only has work in his mind.

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
As for his thoughts,

270
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,280
he won't express.

271
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Why haven't you bought the rings yet?

272
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,040
You could forget about other things

273
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,430
but you shouldn't forget about the rings.

274
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,560
You're right. It's my fault.

275
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,880
I should pay more attention to it.

276
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,950
Yunxi.

277
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,000
Why do I think

278
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,830
Qingyou is a bit different from usual?

279
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,640
Nothing.

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,350
She's just a bit tired lately.

281
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,280
I wish there were no problems between you.

282
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,800
Yunxi.

283
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,190
Don't blame me for nagging.

284
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,280
It's okay if you're busy.

285
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,160
But you should put the wedding in your heart.

286
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,040
Mom, don't worry.

287
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,230
I plan to marry Youyou this year.

288
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,160
This is for certain.

289
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,520
If I can't even control this,

290
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,350
how could I control my life?

291
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,760
Alright.

292
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,280
Okay, Mr. Mo.

293
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,640
I hope we'll enjoy our cooperation.

294
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,310
Me too.

295
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,040
See you.

296
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,920
Goodbye.

297
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,400
Mr. Mo, what a coincidence.

298
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
I chose this for Youyou.

299
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,800
We just set the date for the wedding.

300
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,520
Please be sure to attend.

301
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,190
Such an important thing,

302
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,110
why didn't you pick with Director Xu?

303
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,310
She's busy.

304
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,110
I can choose it myself.

305
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,920
I know what she likes.

306
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,350
Is that so?

307
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,230
Sometimes you think you know,

308
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,160
but it might not be true.

309
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,310
Take your time, Lawyer Fan.

310
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,800
I still have unfinished business. Goodbye.

311
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,040
You don't have to pick me up.

312
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,590
During the peak hours,

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,190
taking the metro is quicker.

314
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,430
I could come every day if I'm not busy.

315
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,640
Oh.

316
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,000
I bought you coffee and bread.

317
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,760
Thank you.

318
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,920
Your favorite cappuccino

319
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,920
and croissant.

320
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,400
What?

321
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,430
Don't you like it?

322
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,430
I do.

323
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,470
But

324
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,430
I haven't drunk cappuccino for long.

325
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,880
Oh, right.

326
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,590
I made plans for us on Saturday.

327
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,000
In the morning, we go to the partner's wedding.

328
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,160
In the afternoon, we go home to see my mom.

329
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,760
At night, we go shopping

330
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,800
to pick some presents for my teacher and his wife.

331
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
I'm busy

332
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,190
signing contracts with Anchor lately.

333
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,640
I'll work overtime on Friday.

334
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,950
I was thinking of taking a good rest on Saturday.

335
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,560
If it's not important, just cancel it.

336
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,040
You don't have to worry about performance.

337
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,040
If you feel a heavy workload,

338
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,710
you can reconsider

339
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,640
resigning and becoming my wife.

340
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,830
Didn't we agree that

341
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,310
we aren't in a rush to get married?

342
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,920
We're going to get married anyway.

343
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,950
This report is mediocre. You have to redo it.

344
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,470
Okay.

345
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,710
Before next Tuesday,

346
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,310
I want a new financial report.

347
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,430
Good morning, Mr. Mo.

348
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,830
Good morning, Director Xu.

349
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,830
Mr. Fan drove you here today.

350
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,000
So considerate of him.

351
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,830
The traffic jam is horrible,
he still drives you here every day.

352
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,710
Are we close to

353
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,190
hearing good news from you two?

354
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,760
Well...

355
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,040
Hello?

356
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,760
Mr. Li.

357
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,000
Are you close to the entrance?

358
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,920
Okay.

359
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm coming over.

360
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,110
Okay.

361
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,040
No problem.

362
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,160
Congratulations, Director Xu.

363
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,070
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

364
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,350
Hello, Mom?

365
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,430
Youyou, are you working?

366
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,880
Just now

367
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,040
Yunxi's mom paid a visit to your dad.

368
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,520
She talked about your wedding.

369
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,160
How about this?

370
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,040
Discuss with Yunxi

371
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,040
and set your wedding date

372
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,920
as soon as possible.

373
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,560
We don't want to worry about it. Do you hear me?

374
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,920
Mom, I'm still busy.

375
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,000
I'll talk to you later.

376
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,280
(Fan Yunxi)
Let's talk tonight.

377
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,680
Hello, may I take your order?

378
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,760
No need.

379
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,470
My friend is coming.

380
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,430
We'll order later.

381
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,110
Okay.

382
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,210
(Youyou: I'm here.
What do you want to eat?)

383
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,160
(Youyou)
I'm here. What do you want to eat?

384
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,160
Sorry, Youyou.

385
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,040
I made an appointment with a client tonight.

386
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,000
I can't leave right now.

387
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,570
(Youyou, voice call)

388
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,680
Hello, Youyou.

389
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,830
I haven't finished my work here.

390
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,760
I can't leave right now.

391
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,310
Are you busy

392
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,190
or unwilling to talk to me at all?

393
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
What do you mean?

394
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,430
How long have we known each other?

395
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,640
Do you think I don't know you well enough?

396
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,350
You never make temporary appointments
with your clients.

397
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,000
You always have a schedule.

398
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,590
How can temporary appointments

399
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,920
interrupt your routine?

400
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,710
What do you want to talk about then?

401
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,160
Fan Yunxi.

402
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,590
With great expectations,

403
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,230
I persuaded myself to start our relationship again.

404
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,590
But why, in this relationship,

405
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,230
you have been ignoring my feelings?

406
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,830
Did my mom mention the wedding to you?

407
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,470
You know, that's my mother.

408
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,830
Is our wedding

409
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,070
a part of your plan that couldn't go wrong

410
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,400
and has to be done anyway?

411
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,880
Youyou, what are you talking about?

412
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,310
I love you.

413
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,470
I want you to become my wife sooner.

414
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,230
Is that so?

415
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,470
If that's true,

416
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,040
you should respect me.

417
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Alright, I don't want to continue this conversation.

418
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,400
I really have some business to do.

419
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,400
Can we talk about this another day?

420
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,280
Xu Qingyou.

421
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,830
Do you think you can pick it up where you left off?

422
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,830
Is it fun to push yourself like this?

423
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,070
It's a joke made at youth,

424
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,470
is it necessary to take it seriously?

425
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,520
This won't end up well.

426
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,520
It's just that the death penalty becomes a reprieve.

427
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,640
Did Lawyer Fan drive you here today?

428
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,830
So considerate of him.

429
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,280
Are we going to

430
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,560
hear good news from you?

431
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,640
I chose this for Youyou.

432
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,400
We just set our wedding date.

433
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,520
Please be sure to attend.

434
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,350
Don't worry, Director Xu.

435
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,000
I promised that

436
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,230
I would keep a distance.

437
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,430
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

438
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,470
Hello, Mengmeng.

439
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,880
I can't attend Shangger's weekly meeting today.

440
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,110
Please get the files ready.

441
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,590
Okay.

442
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,430
Qingyou.

443
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,470
Aren't you coming to the office today?

444
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,190
I'm not coming.

445
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,190
I'm going to Lyuluo's.

446
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
She's doing a live stream today.

447
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,800
Lyuluo?

448
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,880
She's hard to handle.

449
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,520
Last time we sent a few people there
but it was still in vain.

450
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,350
Looks like you have to do it yourself.

451
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,160
Okay.

452
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll try to come back with the signed contract.

453
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,640
Oh.

454
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,640
Please help me mail two boxes of skin care products

455
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,070
to the cultural park in the countryside.

456
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,920
Okay, I'll do it now.

457
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,880
We'll wait for your good news then.

458
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,350
The live stream will start in 20 minutes.

459
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,640
Now you tell me there is something wrong with the poster.

460
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,400
What do you want us to do?

461
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,400
The previous posters were made by me

462
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,640
and never go wrong.

463
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,560
We can only change the poster now.

464
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,920
This live stream is very important to us.

465
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,800
We got the highest discount
for the new products.

466
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,950
And now this happened.

467
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,560
If we don't change the sale rules at once,

468
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,350
there will be no profit. Do you understand?

469
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,590
Change the poster now?

470
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,400
That's impossible.

471
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,920
How would my fans see me?

472
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,830
Do you think I would sacrifice my career

473
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,230
for a single business?

474
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,110
Didn't your team make any backup plans?

475
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,760
Fine.

476
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,000
Then we won't have any collaborations in the future.

477
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,560
I...

478
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,160
The advertising plan is determined already.

479
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,520
If we change it now, there will be problems.

480
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,830
You are?

481
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,160
I am Xu Qingyou,
Director of Operation Department I of Lemi.

482
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,920
We have collaborated with Lemi before.

483
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,070
Here is the thing.

484
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,190
I can contact

485
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,400
the cosmetic brand
that Lemi has been collaborating with.

486
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,880
They are very suitable for today's live stream.

487
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,190
I can help you

488
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,190
ask if they are willing to collaborate.

489
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,560
If it works,

490
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,110
they're live-streaming next to us.

491
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,710
They can deliver the materials you need now.

492
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,280
If that's the case, this involves two brands

493
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,640
with extra sessions and discounts.

494
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,590
Is it okay?

495
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,280
Let's do as you said.

496
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,190
Why didn't you tell me such a great team?

497
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,110
I...

498
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
The collaboration isn't official yet.

499
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,950
But it will be soon.

500
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,110
You guys go ahead.

501
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,710
I have to leave now.

502
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,520
I have something to do.

503
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,040
Okay.

504
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,950
Problem solved.

505
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,800
Go prepare now.

506

(Lyuluo's Live Stream)

509
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,280
Hello, I'm Lyuluo.

510
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,800
Welcome to my live stream.

511
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,560
Today,

512
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,000
I want to recommend you

513
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,350
lots of great products as usual.

514
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,400
Mr. Mo.

515
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,110
This morning we have to go to Mr. Zhao's

516
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,160
cultural park to inspect.

517
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,830
This afternoon you'll have
Lemi's weekly meeting of shareholders.

518
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,590
Mr. Mo?

519
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,920
Let Fang Qi go to the weekly meeting.

520
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,190
Are you afraid you're not going to make it?

521
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,880
Don't worry.

522
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,430
I have a nickname,

523
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,880
Binhai Schumacher.

524
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,760
I am here.

525
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,760
Lemi's weekly meeting is a daily report.

526
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,830
Mr. Zhao's project should be our priority.

527
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,230
Don't forget our lesson with Hongkai Capital.

528
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,880
Mr. Mo.

529
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,190
Please be in a good mood.

530
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Your mood

531
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,280
directly affects the quality of my work environment.

532
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,710
If you say one more word,

533
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,190
my mood will immediately be ruined.

534
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,040
(I'll buy it!)
The highlight lies in

535
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,640
（You are so beautiful)
its paw-shaped design.

536
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,160
When you're showering,

537
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,230
you can use this
to massage your head directly.

538
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,880
Isn't this convenient?

539
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,640
Young adults who face severe hair loss,

540
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,920
just buy this!

541
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,920
Alright.

542
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,070
Our live stream today

543
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,800
is over now.

544
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,400
If you like the products,

545
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,280
please add to your shopping cart and order now!

546
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,430
See you next time.

547
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,830
Thank you for helping me just now.

548
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,160
You're welcome.

549
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,470
Today I'm here...

550
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,280
I know.

551
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,000
You want to talk about the contract, right?

552
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,640
Several employees of your company have come to me.

553
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,430
So can you tell me the reason

554
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,520
why you don't want to sign?

555
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,430
The conditions are negotiable.

556
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm used to being free.

557
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,710
I became a streamer because it was fun.

558
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,880
I do live stream whenever I want

559
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,160
and I take a break as I like.

560
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,110
I think after signing with a company,

561
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,350
there will be many restrictions.

562
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,280
I don't think I'll adapt to this.

563
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,040
I completely understand.

564
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Our team thinks

565
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,040
you are a very potential anchor.

566
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,710
In the future,

567
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,710
the anchor profession

568
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,430
will become more and more professional.

569
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,760
If you fight alone,

570
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,800
you will face a lot of problems.

571
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,110
I promise you,

572
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,880
if you work with our team,

573
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,800
today's problem will never happen.

574
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,520
You know what?

575
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,920
We all love your style.

576
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,160
I even bought

577
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,230
the products you recommended.

578
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,520
If you want to retain your own style,

579
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,000
we would be the first to support.

580
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,110
I can sign

581
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,230
but I have one condition.

582
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,950
Please tell me.

583
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,680
You will be the one to handle all my affairs.

584
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,950
Deal.

585
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,950
Lemi has some star products recently.

586
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
I'll show you.

587
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,880
We have to hurry up with Mr. Zhao's contract.

588
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Okay.

589
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,470
Give me the umbrella.

590
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,280
Thank you.

591
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,190
You're welcome.

592
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,910
I'm just passing by.

593
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,630
Such a coincidence.

594
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm here to check out the plant.

595
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,360
I'm here for Lyuluo's contract.

596
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,800
Xu Qingyou.

597
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,040
I regret the decision I made before.
