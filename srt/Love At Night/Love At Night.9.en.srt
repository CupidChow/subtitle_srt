=Episode 9=

3
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,120
Thank you.

4
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,040
You're welcome.

5
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,760
I was just passing by.

6
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,480
Such a coincidence.

7
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,590
I'm here to check out the plant.

8
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,190
I'm here for Lyuluo's contract.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,630
Xu Qingyou.

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,880
I regret the decision I made before.

11
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,320
I respect your boundaries

12
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,830
but I didn't do it for you to become unhappy.

13
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,270
Thank you for your concern.

14
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,110
I don't feel unhappy.

15
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,750
What's the matter with you?

16
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,360
Did you get rejected by Fang Qi?

17
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
I met that man.

18
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,110
Man?

19
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,030
What man can make you depressed like this?

20
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,720
Fang Qi's ex-husband.

21
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,270
We bumped into him
while we were shopping the other day.

22
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,720
Her face didn't look right.

23
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,910
Impossible.

24
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,080
She's a carefree person.

25
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,830
Why would she be upset about
something ages ago?

26
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,270
She's just putting on a strong face

27
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,190
and telling everyone she's okay.

28
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,630
She's suffering on her own.

29
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,670
Shouldn't you be

30
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,240
helping her out at this time?

31
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm telling you, Xu Wei,

32
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,520
at this moment

33
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,080
if you show her a bit love

34
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,440
the teensiest bit of love,

35
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,390
she will see you as her saviour.

36
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,070
She will give you all her love.

37
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,600
How could I take advantage of her?

38
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
Fine, I'm wrong.

39
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,110
Are you going out?

40
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,640
No.

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,350
I'm just bored and was stretching.

42
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,230
Great.

43
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
I need you for something.

44
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Go.

45
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,230
You can do this!

46
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,390
Fang Qi, how are you feeling?

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,550
This is a great painting.

48
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,670
It's alright.

49
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,830
No.

50
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,110
It looks simple

51
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,640
but I can see the painter's passion.

52
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,390
It's not painted by an ordinary painter.

53
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,950
Xu Wei,

54
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,640
you're really good.

55
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,830
Fang Qi,

56
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,640
I'm happy that you approve of me

57
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,320
but what happened?

58
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,230
Xu Wei,

59
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,350
you went abroad alone at such a young age.

60
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,760
Is it very difficult?

61
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
It's alright.

62
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,830
I got used to it.

63
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,000
You,

64
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,720
you don't look right today.

65
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,110
Are you alright?

66
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,830
I'm experimenting with a
three-step plan to charm a man.

67
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,600
Why aren't you going along with it?

68
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,790
Am I not charming?

69
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,440
You said you need me for something.

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,640
This is it?

71
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,670
What else?

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
I wanted to find you

73
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
and refine the plan

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,640
and use it for blind dates.

75
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,600
Turns out it's just wasting
my performance.

76
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,270
Maybe you can't feel my charisma.

77
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,920
You're going on a blind date again?

78
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,110
Yes.

79
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,070
You know blind dates aren't for you.

80
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,320
Why do you have to go?

81
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,390
You're getting bossy.

82
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,070
Why are you even minding my business?

83
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,790
Is it because of Qu Kai?

84
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,200
Why is it because of him?

85
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,070
I have been single for a while.

86
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,880
I want to find a man and get married.
What's the problem with that?

87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,390
After you saw him last time,
you began acting strangely.

88
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,000
Fang Qi.

89
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Are you trying to compete with him?

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,230
Are you affected by him?

91
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,000
Who's competing with him now?
Who's affected by him?

92
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,230
Yes.

93
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I went on blind dates
because I feel unhappy.

94
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
But what's the matter with that?

95
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,350
Don't I deserve a new marriage?

96
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,350
Don't I deserve happiness?

97
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,160
I don't want you to do this just
because you're angry at him

98
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,880
and marry yourself to
some random stranger.

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,600
You won't be happy this way.

100
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,640
So do you think that

101
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,270
ending up alone

102
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,510
will make me happy?

103
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,920
No.

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,880
Piss off.

105
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,040
It's not like this, Fang Qi.

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,070
That's not what I meant.

107
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,040
I just want you to be happy.

108
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,670
Please don't get upset.

109
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,920
Fang Qi.

110
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,000
Go away.

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,950
Put your shoes on.

112
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,830
Taxi.

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Taxi.

114
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,000
You'd feel painful like this.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Drive over here.

116
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,440
Can you walk a few steps forward?

117
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,510
I can't reverse here.

118
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,480
What are you doing?

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,830
Put me down.

120
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,830
I'm taking you to the taxi.

121
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,950
Driver,

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,880
please take her to Peace Gardens, thank you.

123
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,270
Tell me when you get back home.

124
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,320
Fang Qi,

125
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,760
am I

126
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,320
just a little brother to you?

127
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,150
I'm sorry. We're closed.

128
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,910
I'm not here for alcohol.

129
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,150
If you want food, go out the door
and turn right.

130
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,230
Sa,

131
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,000
it's me.

132
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,230
Can you take off your sunglasses?

133
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,520
What happened to your eyes?

134
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,400
Did someone beat you?

135
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,230
I was jilted.

136
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,030
It's Lingze.

137
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,400
You and Lingze were never a thing.

138
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,590
How could you even be jilted?

139
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,760
Sa,

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,710
I want to ask for a favor.

141
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,520
Can I work here?

142
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,910
If all the girls who came for Lingze

143
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,880
work here,

144
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,670
the salary alone would bankrupt me.

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,590
Then I'll invest in you.

146
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll give you money for more stores.

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,230
I'll make you rich.

148
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,760
Honey,

149
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,960
if I

150
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,280
really like making money,

151
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,910
I would have opened my second store.

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,150
Money is no use to me.

153
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,710
I can bartend.

154
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,550
I can clean.

155
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,710
I can do anything.

156
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,030
I don't want your money.

157
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,320
Just let me stay.

158
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,840
Please?

159
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,230
Go back.

160
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,000
Please, I'm begging you.

161
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,880
Go back.

162
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,640
No.

163
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,110
Sa,

164
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,280
I have some urgent business at home.

165
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,200
I need to take a day off tonight.

166
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,400
Then I can do her shift.

167
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,470
Come on.

168
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,080
Let's go change our clothes.

169
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,470
I say, let's take a break.

170
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,030
The racket is going to break soon.

171
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,760
Here.

172
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,400
Last time I saw you play so hard

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,400
was because...

174
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,590
Tell me, who is it this time?

175
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,350
It's not because of anyone.

176
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,030
I just want to exercise for a bit.

177
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,640
Is this because of that white-collar?

178
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,000
She has a name.

179
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,590
Look, you're being defensive of her.

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,880
Fine.

181
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,760
Ask when she's free.

182
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
We can go out together.

183
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,030
No need.

184
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm not out yet.

185
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,320
Lovesick.

186
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Beer, who wants beer?

187
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,470
Do you want beer?

188
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,080
Here's one for you.

189
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't want it.

190
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,280
Do you want beer?

191
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,710
No.

192
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,710
Do you want beer?

193
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,710
Hi,

194
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,670
how much for this?

195
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Fifty RMB for a bottle.

196
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,640
That's so expensive.

197
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,230
Take it or leave it.

198
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,230
Don't say that.

199
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,910
I didn't say I don't want it.

200
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,520
Here, put it down.

201
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,520
I'll take every bottle you have.

202
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,350
Get away from me.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,520
How dare you touch me?

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,470
I touched you because
I think you look good.

205
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,880
Today, I...

206
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,670
Calm down.

207
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,550
Brother.

208
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,960
Calm down, let me handle this.

209
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,350
Why are you here?

210
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,910
Nobody dared to touch me before.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,670
Do you know who I am?

212
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,080
Why do I care?

213
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,710
Um, my sister's new here.

214
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,280
She doesn't know anything.

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll pay for your beer.

216
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,670
I'm telling you.

217
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,110
Watch your sister.

218
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,470
Do you hear me?

219
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,110
Yes, I will.

220
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,880
Move. Please enjoy your evening.

221
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,110
What do you mean by watching me?

222
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,710
Enjoy, enjoy.

223
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,280
You're finished.

224
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
You're finished, you know that?

225
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
You're finished!

226
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,440
Let's go.

227
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,790
Don't block my way.

228
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,150
Go, go.

229
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,710
He's the one who's wrong.

230
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,710
Why are you barring me?

231
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,880
Well, there's only two of us.

232
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,030
If something happens

233
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,440
we call the police on them.

234
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,840
Give me your phone.

235
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,590
I'll get rid of these scumbags.

236
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,470
Miss Lin,

237
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,880
they have a lot of people with them.

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,520
Also, they are giving you money.

239
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,320
Isn't it buying beer?
I know how to do that too.

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,400
Sa.

241
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,200
Fine, fine.

242
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,590
Alright, alright.

243
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,910
Don't you remember that I told you

244
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,640
to humble yourself?

245
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,550
Do you know what you're here for?

246
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,280
I'm here for Lingze.

247
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,230
Yes.

248
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,960
Mr. Mo doesn't like tough women.

249
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm not tough.

250
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,030
You're buying beer for everyone

251
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,000
and getting into a fight.

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,910
And you still say you're not tough?

253
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,470
What then?

254
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,400
Nothing.

255
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
After all,

256
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,200
you're going to be best buddies with Mr. Mo.

257
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,760
I don't want to be buddies with him.

258
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,790
I want to be his girlfriend.

259
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,470
I'll let him go today.

260
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,350
Good morning, Miss Xu.

261
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,150
Morning.

262
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,280
I regret the decision I made before.

263
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,760
Dayan.

264
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,350
Three days. Fang Qi

265
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,710
hasn't talked to me for three days.

266
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,150
What have you done this time?

267
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,350
I didn't do anything.

268
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,640
I don't believe you.

269
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,080
You must have made her angry.

270
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,550
I was doing it for her own good.

271
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,280
I told her not to go on blind dates.

272
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,840
Those people aren't right for her.

273
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,030
Apart from advising her
not to go on blind dates,

274
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,910
you didn't say anything else?

275
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,790
Nothing.

276
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,760
I just said blind dates aren't good.

277
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,960
And I told her just because
she's mad at him

278
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,320
doesn't mean she has to marry
a random stranger.

279
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,000
Marriage is for life.

280
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,030
She has to be careful about it.

281
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,640
Stop.

282
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
What did you just say?

283
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,230
Marriage is for life.

284
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,840
No, the sentence before this.

285
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,150
Just because she's mad at
her ex-husband.

286
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,790
You're dead.

287
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,150
Dead, dead, dead.

288
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,320
You made worst

289
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,790
mistake,

290
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,200
talking about ex-lovers.

291
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,350
This is rubbing salt on her wound.

292
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,440
Even God can't help you now.

293
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,230
Brother,

294
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,080
take care.

295
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,000
What should I do then?

296
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,080
Thanks.

297
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,670
Why are you here?

298
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,280
If you don't forgive me,

299
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,520
I'll stick to you for the whole day.

300
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,840
Whatever.

301
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,030
Fang Qi.

302
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,000
I know I'm wrong.

303
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,230
In this world,

304
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,230
no every mistake

305
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,590
could be solved with an apology.

306
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,350
You and I go way back.

307
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
Is our relationship nothing
compared to Qu Kai?

308
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,310
I don't want to eat anymore.

309
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,590
Eat.

310
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Don't starve.

311
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,190
I'll leave, okay?

312
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,000
Eat.

313
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,350
Qingyou,

314
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,230
how's the feedback for Meeting Your Match?

315
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,470
It's really good.

316
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,520
Look.

317
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,830
Our single day search volume

318
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,520
has already increased

319
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
up to 300,000 to 500,000.

320
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,070
Nice work.

321
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,070
But

322
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,560
the anchors that we signed

323
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
aren't mainstream anchors.

324
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,920
If we want sustainability...

325
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,350
Car... car accident!

326
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,830
Who?

327
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,190
I heard it's Mr. Mo.

328
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,230
Everyone at Shangger went.

329
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,350
Shangger?

330
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:56,830
What happened?

331
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,880
Mr. Zhai,

332
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,230
Mr. Mo and Mr. Luo from Shangger

333
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,230
were in a car crash on their way back.

334
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,190
Is it serious?

335
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,680
I still don't know yet.

336
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,000
Mr. Zhai, I want to take the day off.

337
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,280
Okay.

338
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,110
What's the matter?

339
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,160
Look, it's on the news.

340
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,430
Reporting

341
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,710
today at 5pm

342
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,070
a massive pileup occurred at
Binshen Highway.

343
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,950
A sedan

344
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,310
crashed into the vehicle in front of it,

345
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,400
causing the car to flip sideways.

346
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,760
The driver was over-fatigued,

347
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,520
which caused this series of incidents.

348
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,430
Currently,

349
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,110
the scene is being cleaned up.

350
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
The specifics

351
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
is still under investigation.

352
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,800
Hello, you can't go in there now.

353
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,430
My relative,

354
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,470
my relative is in there.

355
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,470
Hello?

356
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,800
It's me.

357
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,040
Where are you?

358
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,640
I'm at the countryside.

359
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,560
Our car is malfunctioning.

360
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,920
Is it serious?

361
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,160
It's going to the repairs.

362
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,280
Mr. Luo is hurt.

363
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,830
He just got in the ambulance.

364
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,710
Why didn't you answer my phone?

365
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,640
My phone ran out of battery.

366
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,760
So I couldn't turn my phone on.

367
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,880
If there's nothing else,
I'm going to hang up.

368
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,760
Where are you?

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
I'm just off work.

370
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,680
I still have something to do. Bye.

371
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,230
Xu Qingyou.

372
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,590
Stop running away,

373
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,190
okay?

374
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,280
I should go.

375
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,520
Wait for me.

376
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,640
Why are you here at this hour?
Come on in.

377
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,400
You,

378
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,920
why are you all wet?

379
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,280
What happened?

380
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,430
Go and change now.

381
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,020
(Fan Yunxi: Why don't you answer my phone? You 
should have told me where you are. Contact me soon)

382
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,920
Why are you still working
at this late hour?

383
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,710
It's Fan Yunxi.

384
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
(Youyou: My phone was dead. Don't worry. 
See you tomorrow)

385
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Lawyer Fan has been calling you.

386
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,710
I couldn't stand it if I were you.

387
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,680
He's like that before.

388
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,590
If he can't find me, he'll keep calling

389
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,560
and sending me messages.

390
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,520
I never thought it was a problem before.

391
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,310
But now,

392
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,800
I don't know what to do.

393
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,190
You

394
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,350
are like a frog in lukewarm water.

395
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,760
Only you're close to dying,

396
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,070
will you know to jump out of the pot.

397
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,280
I went to see Mo Lingze.

398
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,830
Really?

399
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,160
Congratulations, Miss Xu.

400
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,000
You're finally brave enough
to face your own feelings.

401
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,160
I am a bit impulsive.

402
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,430
Mo Lingze is unpredictable.

403
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,040
He shouldn't be my choice.

404
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,190
I'm clear about that.

405
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,310
What about Lawyer Fan?

406
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,280
I did have a relationship with him
for ten years.

407
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,830
I want to talk to him again.

408
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,680
Cheating was only the fuse.

409
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,830
You should know this.

410
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,110
Your relationship with him
had problems a long time ago.

411
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,950
The two of you

412
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,880
try very hard to maintain peace
on the surface.

413
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,760
But both of you already have
other things in mind.

414
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,800
What's the point?

415
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,640
Fine.

416
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,400
Let's not talk about this.

417
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,350
Let's eat something sweet.

418
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,680
Cheer up.

419
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,800
This is so bitter.
Are you sure this is sweet?

420
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,400
Only through bitter
can you taste the sweet.

421
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,640
Only after knowing playboys,

422
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,520
would you know

423
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,920
the great joys of the world.

424
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,680
For example,

425
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,520
you spend time on your face

426
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,520
to make yourself happy.

427
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,520
You spend time on work

428
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
so you would feel happy
when you're promoted.

429
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,110
You spend time on me

430
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,920
- and this is the greatest joy of all.
- And this is the greatest joy of all.

431
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,590
Now,

432
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,640
allow me to

433
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,760
read you A Hundred Years of Solitude.

434
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,520
You've been reading it for a long time.
Aren't you finished yet?

435
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Still in solitude?

436
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,350
For three years.

437
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,430
It's such a romantic night.

438
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,280
You're spending time on this?

439
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,310
Do you know its principle?

440
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,590
What principle?

441
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,160
Every string

442
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,950
has its own tracks

443
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,710
and every string would affect
the movement of other strings.

444
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,400
Hence, allowing the whole thing to move.

445
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,190
It's chaotic, unpredictable.

446
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,430
This is you on one side

447
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,830
and on the other side, it's that white-collar.

448
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,590
To keep the balance,

449
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,280
the best way is to

450
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,230
cut it off.

451
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,280
Cut all connections?

452
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,190
I dare you to tell me that
she has nothing to do with this.

453
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,310
I will respect her boundaries

454
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,400
and go back to my original tracks.

455
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,350
Then,

456
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,830
wait for her to come to me voluntarily.

457
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,640
You're speaking in depth tonight.

458
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,310
I don't understand what you're saying.

459
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,430
Thanks.

460
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,070
When you arrived at Fang Qi's,

461
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,040
you should tell me that.

462
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,310
Next time, don't lose contact
for more than two hours, okay?

463
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,160
I was so worried
that I nearly called the police.

464
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,350
Even though I didn't tell you

465
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,160
you would know where am I, don't you?

466
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,920
Yunxi,

467
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,710
I want to talk to you.

468
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,920
If you have the time
and you're willing to...

469
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,310
Why are you getting so serious?

470
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
What do you want to talk about?

471
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,830
About us.

472
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,520
I gave a lot of thought to it.

473
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,920
I think it's time for us

474
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,190
to know each other again.

475
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,920
Okay.

476
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,430
I'll come pick you up after work today.

477
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,400
What do you want to eat?

478
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,680
I'm not hungry.

479
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,710
Then I'll order truffle steak for you.

480
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,280
I don't like the taste of truffle.

481
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,310
I told you many times

482
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,950
but you still didn't remember.

483
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,520
It's my fault.

484
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,280
So just like before

485
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,590
I promise I'll make it up to you.

486
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,000
No need.

487
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,520
Not everything could be
like how it was before.

488
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,880
What's gotten into you recently?

489
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,830
Are you too stressed out about work?

490
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,880
Or is it because of the wedding?

491
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,760
I told you that's my mom's doing.

492
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,280
You have handled a lot of
difficult issues.

493
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,230
You should understand.

494
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,470
Running away won't solve anything.

495
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,640
Then pray tell.

496
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,470
What problem do we have?

497
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,350
Are you still pretending to be silly?

498
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,070
Fine.

499
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,800
Then I'll just be frank about it.

500
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,000
I chose to forgive,

501
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,560
to accept.

502
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,280
I thought we could make it work again.

503
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,000
But now

504
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,640
we're facing a bigger problem.

505
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,070
I don't think there's any problem.

506
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,000
This is the problem.

507
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,110
You think everything is reasonable

508
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,560
and according to your plan.

509
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,640
So there isn't any problem.

510
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,830
I don't matter at all.

511
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,710
That's because we're together
for ten years.

512
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,470
We know each other really well.

513
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,710
The arrangements I made for you

514
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,880
are the best for you.

515
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,230
Wasn't it like this before?

516
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,520
Yes.

517
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,520
Ten years.

518
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,880
We have been together for ten years.

519
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,000
And now

520
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,800
I have only realized that
I don't know you at all.

521
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,590
What happened?

522
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,760
Why has everything gone wrong suddenly?

523
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,280
It wasn't sudden.

524
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,880
I have been holding back for a long time.

525
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,040
Is this because of Mo Lingze?

526
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,830
This has nothing to do with others.

527
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,680
I know last time, you and Mo Lingze

528
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,110
stayed the night together at the plant.

529
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,160
Don't tell me nothing happened.

530
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,040
You're suspecting me.

531
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,520
You don't need to get nervous.

532
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,310
What I want to say is

533
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,310
I will tolerate you.

534
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,830
I also made mistakes.

535
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,680
Now we're even.

536
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,830
We'll call it even, okay?

537
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,310
If that night I really

538
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,920
did do something with Mo Lingze,

539
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,830
could we really call it even?

540
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,280
It doesn't matter.

541
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,430
The important thing is we let it go,

542
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,350
marry,

543
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,350
and start a new life.

544
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,880
So it only matters that we marry?

545
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,950
You don't care about

546
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,710
what happened to me and other men?

547
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,470
I don't need to care about

548
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,230
what happened between you and
other women. Is that so?

549
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,400
I said we can both forgive each other.

550
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,590
We're not saints.

551
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,310
I can totally understand impulses.

552
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,230
Who do you think I am?

553
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,350
Your partner?

554
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,880
Or maybe we could be
partners in marriage.

555
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,800
How could you say this?

556
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,590
I chose to come back to you

557
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,640
because I can't let go of
our 10 year relationship.

558
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,350
I never thought

559
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,310
that to you,

560
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,800
our relationship doesn't matter anymore.

561
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,000
There's no love between us.

562
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,590
Why do you still want us to be together?

563
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,230
You should have told me earlier.

564
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,110
So we don't have to waste
each other's time.

565
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,430
Youyou,

566
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,640
stop acting like a child.

567
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,470
If I don't care about our relationship,

568
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,110
why would I want to marry you?

569
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,710
You're already 30 years old.

570
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,000
For ten years that we've been together,

571
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,590
you know you won't find a better option.

572
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,710
Yes.

573
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,040
Ten years.

574
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,350
After ten years, the result

575
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,190
is to marry for the sake of marrying.

576
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,350
I think we have waited long enough

577
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,470
and there's no need to wait anymore.
