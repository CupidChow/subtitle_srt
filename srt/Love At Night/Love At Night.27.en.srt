=Episode 27=

3
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,440
Nice hurl!

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,760
Are you here to blow off some steam?

5
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,279
No.

6
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,199
You know,

7
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,679
the worse your mood is,

8
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,919
the lower your score will be.

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,160
You must be in a bad mood.

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
To be honest,

11
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,000
my dad doesn't like Mo Lingze.

12
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Well.

13
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,320
He is not the kind of person

14
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,119
your dad would like.

15
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,000
Have you ever had a cat?

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,279
No.

17
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,360
You know,

18
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,360
if you need to bring a new cat home,

19
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,600
your old cat won't be happy

20
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,600
and won't like it.

21
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,039
So,

22
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,960
you have to separate them

23
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,600
and let them get used to

24
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,080
each other's scent first.

25
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,880
Then let them get familiar with each other.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
I don't know the old cat's temper.

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,559
But Mo Lingze, the new cat,

28
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,240
is not good-tempered.

29
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,559
Grumpy.

30
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,759
Exactly.

31
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,880
If we're not careful, he bites.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,199
No matter what temper they have,

33
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,279
I should let them

34
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,639
get along well with each other.

35
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's have a game.

36
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,800
OK.

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
Old cat Xu,

38
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,679
let me show you

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,399
how good Mo Lingze is to me.

40
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,160
I have a stomachache

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,519
and fever.

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,480
Where are you?

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,119
Are you okay?

44
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,959
I feel sick.

45
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:37,920
You don't have to come all the way to see me.

46
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,040
I'm fine.

47
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm right next door.

48
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,040
Why do you have a fever?

49
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,880
Gastritis...

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
It's gastritis.

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,839
What's your body temperature?

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,640
Let me take a look.

53
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,679
39 °C.

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,920
39 °C?

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,959
Let's go.

56
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,720
Let's go to the hospital.

57
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,359
No.

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,399
I'm fine.

59
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,320
I always have gastritis.

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Just let me rest.

61
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,959
As long as you take good care of me,

62
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,839
I will be good soon.

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
You need to rest in your room.

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,920
Let's go.

65
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,440
No.

66
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,839
My body aches when I move.

67
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,799
Let's just stay here.

68
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,959
It's well ventilated here.

69
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,959
It helps me recover.

70
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,480
All right.

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
Wait a minute.

72
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,119
Don't bother too much.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,799
This quilt is too heavy.

74
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,200
You can't recover until you sweat.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,679
Come on.

76
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,359
Let me help you up and drink the potion.

77
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,200
OK.

78
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,519
Come on.

79
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,239
OK.

80
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,880
I'd like something with ice.

81
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,399
You can't until the fever is gone.

82
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,480
Come on. Be good.

83
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:54,959
Come on.

84
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,600
Drink it.

85
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,279
I don't want to.

86
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,200
Or I'll be angry.

87
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,000
Come on.

88
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,519
Well.

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,799
Come on.

90
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,399
Take a break.

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,119
I've been sweating a lot.

92
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,079
I feel my fever has gone.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
I feel much better.

94
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,279
Really useful.

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,079
Your method is great.

96
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,399
I feel fresh now.

97
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,880
I'm hungry.

98
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,760
Can you cook for me?

99
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:18,799
OK.

100
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,440
What do you wanna eat?

101
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,359
I wanna eat roast beef.

102
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,079
You have a stomachache
but you wanna eat roast beef?

103
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,239
Yes.

104
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,679
Hunger might be the reason to

105
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,239
my stomachache.

106
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,280
You cook so well.

107
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
I'm happy as long as I look at it.

108
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,479
As soon as I am happy, I will recover.

109
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:37,960
Forget it.

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,919
I'll cook for you.

111
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,039
Sit there and wait.

112
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,679
Aren't we having a group meeting today?

113
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,960
Do you know what's most important
to start a business?

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Ca...capital...

115
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,640
Braveness.

116
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,000
My dad told me,

117
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,919
for investment, the braves take all the cakes

118
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,919
while cowards starve to death.

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
So we, in our business,

120
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,119
need to have incomparable braveness.

121
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:18,919
But

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,799
we don't have to watch horror movies to train it.

123
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,000
If so,

124
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,760
I'm afraid I can never start a business.

125
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,080
You won't know until you try.

126
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,400
Failing the test

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,679
means you really can't.

128
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,640
But if you freak out and retreat,

129
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,960
it means you are short in attitudes.

130
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,320
Besides,

131
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
putting the braveness aside,

132
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,719
there are other good points in you.

133
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,039
I have plenty of time

134
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,119
to discover them.

135
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,039
It hurts a lot.

138
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,200
Here you go.

139
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:13,840
Open your mouth.

140
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,200
Cool it down.

141
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,440
I have cooled it already.

142
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,679
Do it again.

143
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,119
The light is too bright for me.

144
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,799
Can you come here?

145
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,119
Then you can block it.

146
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,159
Too bright?

147
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,640
It hurts my eyes.

148
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,239
Really.

149
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,679
Take it.

150
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,840
Cool it down again.

151
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,919
I've already done it.

152
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,840
It's hot.

153
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,919
It's getting cold.

154
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,479
It's still hot.

155
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,400
Let's cool it down together.

156
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,679
Cool it down together.

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,640
Come on.

158
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,760
Hot food is bad for health.

159
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,159
Hurry up.

160
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,119
I have a stomachache.

161
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,799
It hurts so much.

162
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,359
A 42 ℃ fever doesn't stop our drama queen.

163
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,119
You've got a tough body indeed.

164
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,919
You are a fan of this?

165
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,679
Tell me, what's going on?

166
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,960
You won't, will you?

167
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,280
Well.

168
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,559
Then I'll leave.

169
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Wait, wait.

170
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,640
Let me tell you the truth.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
I put a camera there

172
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,320
is because I wanted my dad to see that

173
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,719
you will take good care of me if I'm sick.

174
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:04,960
Then he won't misunderstand you.

175
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,159
You talked to your dad about me?

176
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,520
It seems that it was not a good conversation.

177
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,479
My dad is stubborn.

178
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,840
He just hasn't figured it out yet.

179
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,239
You're so good.

180
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,640
He will definitely like you.

181
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,119
I know your dad's concern.

182
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,440
Actually, you don't have to bother.

183
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,799
Don't worry.

184
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,799
I can deal with it.

185
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,359
The new cat is cuter

186
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,400
and more obedient.

187
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,200
Although I am not sick,

188
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,280
I will

189
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,039
finish the delicious food you cooked for me.

190
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,400
It's delicious.

191
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,679
But there are not even side dishes.

192
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,159
Are you too stingy?

193
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,400
Call Mo to invite him

194
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,679
for our dinner soup.

195
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,679
Why are you in such a hurry

196
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,359
to meet your son-in-law?

197
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,080
Just let him come to our home then.

198
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
To see your dad?

199
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,679
Forget it.

200
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,919
Let me

201
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,799
meet him first

202
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,000
to see how he is.

203
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,880
OK.

204
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll call him.

205
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:33,719
Hello.

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,919
Could you come back earlier today?

207
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,479
Nothing.

208
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,440
I learned how to make soup.

209
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,599
OK.

210
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,599
Take your time.

211
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,919
He has a client to meet tonight,

212
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,400
so he may come back later.

213
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,559
That's fine.

214
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,599
We'll wait.

215
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,400
We're not hungry.

216
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,479
Hello, Uncle Xu.

217
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,760
I'm Mo Lingze,

218
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,320
Xu Qingyou's boyfriend.

219
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,520
Mom.

220
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
You are with me tonight.

221
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,599
What about my dad's dinner?

222
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,520
Your dad?

223
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,760
Just let him starve

224
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,359
and reflect on himself.

225
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,119
I'm telling you,

226
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,479
my head aches

227
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,080
every time when he speaks.

228
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,280
Every day, he says,

229
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,719
young people nowadays...

230
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,880
As if he had never been young before.

231
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,000
You young people nowadays

232
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,520
are extreme and selfish.

233
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,239
You will regret it when you are old.

234
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,520
When you

235
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,440
have your relationship,

236
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
he pays more attention than you.

237
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,119
I'm so annoyed.

238
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,960
Because he's my dad.

239
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,479
I know my daughter best.

240
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,400
She must have been captivated

241
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,239
by your decent appearance.

242
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,359
I think I still need his consent.

243
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,640
Why don't we let them talk to each other?

244
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:03,919
Uncle Xu.

245
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,039
Do you think your daughter

246
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,520
is the kind of person who only values appearance?

247
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,640
Although I haven't known her for long,

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,880
I know that

249
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,280
she knows what she wants.

250
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,960
But

251
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,719
you also know your father.

252
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,840
He will show a

253
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,239
serious and strict attitude.

254
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,479
I don't want to hear that.

255
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,960
Let me ask you something.

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,760
How old are you?

257
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,119
What is your job?

258
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,200
Tell me about your family.

259
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,760
In fact,

260
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,000
he is a paper dragon.

261
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,080
After two or three rounds,

262
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,200
he won't be like that.

263
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,119
Uncle Xu.

264
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,440
I can take responsibilities
for anything I've ever done.

265
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,080
I believe the same is true for Qingyou.

266
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,719
Two or three rounds?

267
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,320
One is enough.

268
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,960
Once they drink,

269
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,280
he will not be what he used to be.

270
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,280
Wine tests a man.

271
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,159
Rock, paper, scissors.

272
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:50,880
Drink together.

273
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,760
Rock, paper, scissors.

274
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,320
Let him drink with Mo?

275
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,559
Forget it.

276
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,119
He will lose control.

277
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,400
It would be embarrassing

278
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,440
if he called Mo his younger brother.

279
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,919
Remember.

280
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,719
No way.

281
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm telling you, bro,

282
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Qingyou

283
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,439
will show her finger heart to me and her mom.

284
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,800
Can you?

285
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:16,959
Umm...

286
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:21,000
Qingyou will do this to me.

287
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
Can you?

288
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,599
You know what?

289
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,319
That doesn't mean you know her.

290
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,040
Tell me,

291
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:34,760
why you love my daughter?

292
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,640
I love all of her.

293
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm telling you,

294
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
you love her.

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
You must love her forever.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,760
Protect her.

297
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,880
She can never be hurt in any ways.

298
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,280
You hear me?

299
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:57,160
What? He is drunk again?

300
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,479
I'm at home. Well.

301
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,319
I'll be right back.

302
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,400
You know what?

303
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,319
Your dad's drunk again.

304
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,400
I'm speechless.

305
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,680
When on earth will he

306
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,640
get rid of this bad habit?

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
He looked down on Mo Lingze.

308
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,520
At least he

309
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,599
didn't sleep on the street

310
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,800
cuddling with a telephone pole.

311
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,800
Then I'll call you when I'm back.

312
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,680
Take your time.

313
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,439
Be safe, mom.

314
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,479
Hello.

315
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,839
What?

316
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,680
Mo Lingze.

317
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,599
What's the matter with you?

318
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,680
I just praised you to my mom.

319
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,079
And then you did this?

320
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,000
Let go.

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,599
No.

322
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,359
Let go.

323
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,479
Xu Qingyou.

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
You have never showed me that gesture.

325
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,160
I want you to show me right now.

326
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,000
What?

327
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,599
The super cute one.

328
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,920
All right, stop it.

329
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,160
Let's go home.

330
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,920
Hurry up.

331
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,599
Hurry up.

332
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:13,880
All right.

333
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,239
Come here.

334
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,520
Come.

335
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,479
Come here.

336
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,920
Don't move. Do you hear me?

337
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,599
I'll be your sheep.

338
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,359
Don't be angry.

339
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,319
You want me not to be angry, right?

340
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,239
In exchange,

341
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
you should repeat

342
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,199
what I say, OK?

343
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,319
I'll repeat

344
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,479
what you say.

345
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,839
I, Mo Lingze, hereby make the declaration.

346
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,560
You, Xu Qingyou, hereby make the declaration.

347
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm Xu Qingyou. You are Mo Lingze.

348
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,839
You are Xu Qingyou. I'm Mo Lingze.

349
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,280
I must be patient, very patient.

350
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
Only in this way can I have my family standing.

351
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,439
I will listen to Xu Qingyou from now on.

352
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,640
I will obey her absolutely.

353
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,319
I will listen to Mo Lingze from now on.

354
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,560
I will obey him absolutely.

355
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,479
I don't think you are drunk at all.

356
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,680
You did it on purpose.

357
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,439
If I break the contract,

358
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,439
I will take on all the housework.

359
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:20,119
Liability and punishment for breach of contract
need to be discussed with the legal specialist.

360
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
(The car you hailed will be there soon)

361
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,800
Fine. I can cut that part anyway.

362
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,359
Let's go.

363
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
Come on, wet the other eye.

364
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,719
No more.

365
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,439
Let me send you home.

366
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:02,839
One more shot, please.

367
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,880
Sir, it's your fifth shot.

368
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,199
Or shall I change your drink?

369
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:07,959
No.

370
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,599
I only drink this.

371
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,479
Well. Well.

372
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Here you go.

373
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,000
Do you wanna try this?

374
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,040
Why should I try new things?

375
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,319
Too risky. Too costly.

376
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,959
But drinking alone in blue

377
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,599
makes people drunk.

378
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,680
I am here to see somebody,

379
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,160
but she didn't come.

380
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,000
Lawyer Fan.

381
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,040
Must you make things difficult for yourself?

382
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,319
It doesn't matter.

383
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,040
I just want what belongs to me back.

384
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,800
Mo Lingze.

385
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,280
It's three o'clock in the morning.

386
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,040
Can you go to bed?

387
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:30,920
Get out of my way.

388
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,520
You're blocking the galaxy.

389
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:38,599
OK, let's make way for the galaxy.

390
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,680
We don't bother to argue with big babies.

391
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,079
Is this all right?

392
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:44,839
Why are you holding my galaxy?

393
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,479
Give me.

394
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,800
OK.

395
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,839
All these are yours, okay?

396
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,800
The fox and the little prince

397
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,680
will be together forever.

398
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes, they will always be together

399
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
like us.

400
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,880
So, can you listen to the fox

401
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,920
and go to bed now?

402
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,920
If the fox is angry,

403
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,040
she will bite.

404
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,359
Then you'll sleep here?

405
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,520
Well.

406
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,640
The fox.

407
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:54,560
Everyone around you bullies me.

408
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:59,319
Will you bully me

409
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,560
like them?

410
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,040
I will always protect you,

411
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,920
little prince without armor.

412
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,800
Are you awake?

413
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,400
You got a headache?

414
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,319
Why am I here?

415
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,280
If I hadn't stopped you yesterday,

416
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,520
you would have fought with this stool leg.

417
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,280
You also watched the galaxy all night.

418
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
Don't joke.

419
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:43,800
Wait a minute.

420
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,520
Let me show you something.

421
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,199
I will listen to

422
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,000
Xu Qingyou from now on.

423
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,959
I will obey her absolutely.

424
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,439
Go ahead, what do you want?

425
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,199
In fact, it's very simple.

426
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,959
Let me arrange the New Year's Eve.

427
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,439
You should know,

428
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,199
an agreement made without a clear head

429
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,160
has no legal effect.

430
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,319
Look,

431
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,640
this's how you usually smile,

432
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,119
which shows that you had a clear head at that time.

433
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,560
Then why did you edit, reorganize

434
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,079
and subtitle it?

435
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,560
Because I wanna keep your perfect image.

436
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,040
You burp

437
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,680
when you're drunk.

438
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,680
Burps destroy your perfect image.

439
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,680
So, I need to edit.

440
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,079
Also, when you are drunk,

441
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,839
you can't articulate clearly.

442
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,000
So I can only subtitle it.

443
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,640
It's all for your own good.

444
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,040
Well, give me the original video.

445
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,319
I deleted it, for sure.

446
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,199
That's embarrassing.

447
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,160
Right?

448
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,079
Great.

449
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,280
I'll arrange the New Year's Eve.

450
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Also, I usually smile like this.

451
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,640
I wanna poached eggs.

452
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,880
All my efforts were fruitless.

453
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,640
Qingyou is not

454
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,680
the little girl you think she was.

455
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,959
You mean,

456
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,239
I don't know much about her now,

457
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,040
right?

458
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:50,839
Hello.

459
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:51,880
Hello.

460
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,599
I'm here for Xu Qingyou.

461
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:54,479
I'm her father.

462
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,239
OK, no problem.

463
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:55,920
Please follow me.

464
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,319
OK.

465
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,439
Ms. Xu is having a meeting.

466
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,880
You can wait for her in her office.

467
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,359
OK.

468
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,439
Thank you.

469
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:11,079
You're welcome.

470
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,270
(Director, Business Development Department)

471
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,760
Hey, mom.

472
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,520
Do you miss me?

473
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,079
Why did you bring me food today?

474
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,239
It's your dad, the old buffer.

475
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:21,079
He wanted to see your work place.

476
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,439
My dad?

477
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,520
I was not available. Was he angry?

478
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,719
He...

479
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,040
He was happy when he came back.

480
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,599
That's ok.

481
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,239
Listen,

482
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,239
bring Mo back

483
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,000
on Winter Solstice.

484
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,079
Mom, is he going to

485
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,479
break us up?

486
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,959
It depends on whether

487
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,560
the young lovers are tough enough.

488
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,199
Well, I got to go.

489
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,160
Who is it?

490
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,680
Me.

491
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:10,239
Good evening, Mr. Mo.

492
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,640
Mr. Mo.

493
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,400
This is the soup I made specially for you.

494
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,439
Please try.

495
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,199
It's your trump card to win back

496
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:19,199
the New Year's Eve,

497
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,400
isn't it?

498
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,839
Of course not.

499
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,000
I just wanna build up your health.

500
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:26,439
This is the essence of my mom's recipes.

501
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,719
Please try it.

502
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,400
Here.

503
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
How is it? Is it delicious?

504
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,160
Yes.

505
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,959
It was stewed for three hours.

506
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,839
Thanks a lot.

507
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,119
Don't beat around the bush.

508
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,199
Well.

509
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,959
My dad invites you to my home on Winter Solstice.

510
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,439
If it's hard for you

511
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,680
I can refuse him

512
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,040
and we don't need to go.

513
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
I didn't say no.

514
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,479
You agreed?

515
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,880
Well.

516
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,239
My dad

517
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,959
has been a professor all his life,

518
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,119
so he criticizes students.

519
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:22,800
He may be kind of arrogant to you.

520
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,319
Since I'll be in your home,

521
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,239
you have to protect me.

522
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,479
I will let you down.

523
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,000
Once something happens, I will run away.

524
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,400
Just remember to follow me.

525
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,719
Got it.

526
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,400
Try some more.

527
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,040
Have a try.

528
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,000
Yummy.

529
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,400
Yummy.

530
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,280
Fang Qi.

531
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,320
Fang Qi.

532
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,600
Tomorrow is Winter Solstice.

533
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,399
You love my mom's

534
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,639
meat dumplings most.

535
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,479
Let's go home and eat dumplings together.

536
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,040
Dumplings are delicious.

537
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,879
But I'm afraid our relationship

538
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,080
will be discovered.

539
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,120
I didn't ask you to see my family.

540
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,040
Let's wait and see.

541
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,239
What?

542
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,919
Xu Qingyou

543
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,919
will take Poker Face home?

544
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,840
My parents are ready to give

545
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,600
a good test to their future son-in-law.

546
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,840
That's worth the risk.

547
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,439
Let's wait and see.

548
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,800
But you must behave yourself.

549
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,280
Don't make troubles.

550
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,840
Things should go slow with your parents.

551
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,760
Don't worry.

552
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,360
I'll be good in front of them.

553
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,879
All right. Let's continue.

554
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,199
Hit the sandbag, not me!

555
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,439
Can't I?
