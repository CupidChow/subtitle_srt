What are you doing? Stop it!

4
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,760
Director Xu.

5
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,680
You don't want to have connections
with me that much?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,279
Does my thought count?

7
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,760
You like making decisions for others.

8
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,839
Your address.

9
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,039
Company, to work overtime.

10
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you need me to send you upstairs?

11
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,639
No, thanks.

12
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,919
Mr. Mo.

13
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,320
Thank you for driving me back.

14
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,119
We're quits now.

15
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,160
Are you thinking about your guitar stand?

16
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,600
Who?

17
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,079
Mo.

18
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,119
A new girlfriend?

19
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,640
Really？

20
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Wanna gamble on it?

21
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,320
I lost the bet on

22
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,519
Sa and that foreigner.

23
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,959
I'll win this time.

24
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay, but

25
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,079
I have to take a look at her

26
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,160
at least.

27
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,359
Agree, Sa?

28
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,359
The white-collar woman, right?

29
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,320
A white-collar lady.

30
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,920
Write it down.

31
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,200
Write it down.

32
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,000
A white-collar female.

33
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,399
Double-dealer.

34
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,920
What's her name?

35
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,079
Xu Qingyou.

36
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:03,200
Xu Qingyou,

37
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,959
okay.

38
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,720
He's stuck on her.

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,920
It's so typical of him. Forget it.

40
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,600
How to spell the "qing"?

41
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,920
Q-i-n-g.

42
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,359
Q-i-n-g.

43
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,959
Director Xu, you've repeatedly emphasized

44
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,359
the distance rule in front of me.

45
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,679
What are you worrying about?

46
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,720
Hello, Mengmeng.

47
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,720
Hello, Qingyou.

48
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,279
It's said that our company plans to restructure

49
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,640
and many people will be fired this time.

50
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,160
Have you heard about this?

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,519
What?

52
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,399
Director Xu.

53
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,880
Why are you in a hurry?

54
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,559
Isn't being busy normal?

55
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,559
Why are you so idle?

56
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,640
Aren't you afraid of being caught
by the surveillance camera?

57
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,119
Mr. Zhai.

58
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,200
I don't agree with your plan.

59
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,679
Qingyou.

60
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,079
You've been

61
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,920
pestering me by phone calls
and voice messages since last night.

62
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,399
Don't beat around the bush.

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
With our performance,

64
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,600
it's not fair to dismiss three members
from our department.

65
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,040
That's it.

66
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,600
Look at your dept.,

67
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,799
80% of the KPI

68
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,079
are completed by you and Xia Meng.

69
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,679
The optimization is to screen the unproductive ones out.

70
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,559
I am responsible for failing to

71
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,440
cultivate them.

72
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Please give me time

73
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,119
and I won't let you down.

74
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,279
Qingyou,

75
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,799
here is the truth that

76
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,440
Department I and  II
will be merged someday,

77
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,000
and you are competent for the general manager.

78
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,399
Don't let others block your path.

79
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,920
I can give up competing for the post, but...

80
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,679
Listen,

81
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,399
the workplace has its own rules.

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Take care of your emotions.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,359
Capital injection accelerates the company operations.

84
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,959
Elimination is natural.

85
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,559
Do you want to affect the efficiency of the company

86
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,239
with your mercy?

87
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,359
It seems that optimizing the internal structure
is Mr. Mo's instruction.

88
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,839
Director Xu.

89
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,640
Your compassion is inappropriate

90
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:31,920
for the workplace.

91
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:34,760
Qingyou.

92
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,920
You may need more time.

93
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,839
Well,

94
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,279
go back to work and think it twice.

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,720
Okay, sir.

96
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,160
Please take your seat, Mr. Mo.

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,839
Dong Bao, is Qingyou out?

98
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,000
-Shall we go? -I don't know.

99
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,799
-Go. -Let's go.

100
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,720
Qingyou.

101
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,119
Are they really going to fire us?

102
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,559
If it's real,

103
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,640
what should I do with my mortgage?

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,640
Do you remember that
when the company was established,

105
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,000
we had no customer,

106
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,519
what did we do at that time?

107
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,519
Yeah.

108
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,239
We kept handing out leaflets

109
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,799
and established numerous chat groups

110
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,079
to attract customers.

111
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,519
How about the advertorial incident, Dong Bao?

112
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,359
We set up a row of tents in the company

113
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,520
and spent several nights rectifying the community.

114
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,159
Everyone had panda eyes these days,

115
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,799
but we managed to establish a sound background management mechanism for public praise.

116
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,599
We've gone through

117
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,880
a very difficult time.

118
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,760
I believe that

119
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,719
everyone will be able to overcome it.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,880
However,

121
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,679
you made great efforts

122
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,599
when encountering difficulties.

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,760
But now

124
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,760
you are slacking off with good performance.

125
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,599
I have only demand.

126
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,520
Please resume your original enthusiasm,

127
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,559
okay?

128
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,359
Okay.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,559
Xia Meng.

130
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,919
Send me the data of operational business.

131
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,559
Okay.

132
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,119
Continue your work.

133
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,640
Thank you, Qingyou.

134
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,250
（ Employees' competence and performance)

135
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,080
Hey.

136
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,679
Hello, are you asleep?

137
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,799
Not yet.

138
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,359
I heard that

139
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,919
Lemi planned to restructure.

140
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeah.

141
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,760
That's not bad.

142
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,640
You've been so tired with your work.

143
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,719
Why not quit

144
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,719
and have a good rest?

145
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,159
And we will

146
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,640
have more time to stay together.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,679
Do you think that I can rest

148
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,440
when my department meets difficulties?

149
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,039
You took me wrong.

150
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,559
I'm afraid you are too tired.

151
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,719
I have work to do.

152
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,200
Sleep early, good night.

153
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,080
Xiaofang.

154
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,760
Collect information and evidence

155
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,599
about the unfair layoffs of Lemi.

156
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,159
We'll sue Lemi in the name of Qingyou.

157
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,679
Do we need to discuss with Qingyou?

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
No,

159
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,200
she's busy enough lately.

160
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,679
I am solely responsible for it.

161
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,840
Okay.

162
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,239
Mr. Mo.

163
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,119
Director Xu, don't you remember

164
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm not available today?

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,080
Ten minutes, please.

166
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,719
I won't waste ten minutes of my life

167
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,760
on your favour.

168
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,119
It's not just favour,

169
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,520
but also about the stability of the team.

170
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,200
Wanna sit with us?

171
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,200
No,

172
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,520
thanks.

173
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
Please go on.

174
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,320
Mr. Zhang.

175
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,919
My assistant has emailed

00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,200
relevant documents of investment analysis

177
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,479
to you.

178
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,280
The game KN is a hit

179
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,000
in the public.

180
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,039
It shows a growing trend,

181
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,359
so I think it's a good opportunity for us

182
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,159
to promote this project now.

183
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,320
Thank you.

184
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,080
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

185
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,719
Okay.

186
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,119
Mr. Mo.

187
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,760
You're really good at grasping every chance.

188
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,760
Your time is precious,

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,479
but you have to go to the bathroom

190
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,760
or pay the bill.

191
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,640
There must be a chance to finish my speech.

192
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,000
Nine minutes left.

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,599
Pardon me?

194
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,960
One minute passed.

195
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,799
Only nine minutes left.

196
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,359
Mr. Mo, look at this.

197
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Dapang, a careful observer.

198
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,719
(Analysis of employees' competence)
He shows great perception

199
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,320
in his assessment of the market.

200
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,359
Grandma's Dinner was planned by him.

201
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:54,760
And Dong Bao,

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,239
she is good at making customers resonate with her.

203
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,080
She managed to persuade a captious customer.

204
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,919
Six years.

205
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,400
They've been here for six years

206
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,400
because they've witnessed the tough growth of Lemi

207
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,679
from a seed to a towering tree.

208
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,719
They are really affectionate towards Lemi.

209
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,320
Director Xu.

210
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:12,000
Every investor has his own criterion.

211
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,320
From my perspective,

212
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,679
being emotional curbs the marketization most.

213
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,440
But only with enthusiasm

214
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,719
can they devote themselves to the work

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,679
instead of making a perfunctory effort.

216
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,320
Make the best use of people and gain the most profits.

217
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,760
A streamlined department equals efficiency.

218
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,239
Mr. Mo, have you considered

219
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,479
the stability of the team?

220
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,239
Will it affect the whole company?

221
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:30,840
Director Xu.

222
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,760
Restructuring means a better future.

223
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,359
If you have right-hand men,

224
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
they won't let you stay up all night

225
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,719
to prepare this explanation.

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,919
You can only stand here lonely

227
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,599
to try to convince me and protect your subordinates.

228
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,479
Time is up.

229
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,400
You failed.

230
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,599
Mr. Mo.

231
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,559
Are you really so callous?

232
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,000
Director Xu.

233
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,200
I've seen too many old entrepreneurs

234
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,880
lose their money

235
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,200
because of indulging in doing favours.

236
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,000
Director Xu.

237
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,559
You are too naive.

238
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,719
Forehead.

239
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,239
Shoulder.

240
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,039
Nose.

241
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,599
Who is this guy?

242
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,440
My boss.

243
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,400
My enemy.

244
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,239
Have a rest.

245
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,239
I will make you another glass of wine.

246
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,000
No, thanks.

247
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:26,919
Let's go.

248
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,239
Is this the Miss Goddess you have a crush on?

249
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,760
Let me tell you some tricks to attract her.

250
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,400
Really?

251
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,840
Have you heard of the suspension bridge effect?

252
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,599
When one person is in danger,

253
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,359
she will fall in love with another one with her.

254
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,239
Where is the danger now?

255
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,239
There is no danger,

256
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,880
but we can create some.

257
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,880
-What are you doing? -Be careful.

258
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,159
Fang Qi, I have something to tell you.

259
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,919
Fruit.

260
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,359
Here you are.

261
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,119
Go!

262
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,760
Fang Qi, actually I...

263
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,280
It's rotten.

264
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,840
You are on purpose?

265
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,640
Don't be so picky.

266
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,080
You...

267
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,239
Fang Qi.

268
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,159
My pants.

269
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,280
I'm sure that you did it on purpose,

270
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,039
right?

271
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,880
Stay here!

272
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,479
-I didn't mean it. -You brat!

273
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,719
One can not make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

274
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,919
I'll beat you!

275
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,599
You chose the place deliberately?

276
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,200
Yes, sir.

277
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,599
You interviewed me

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,039
here.

279
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:58,280
At that time, surprised by your boast of Lemi,

280
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,239
I suspected that you were a liar.

281
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:01,640
Yeah,

282
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,400
eight years have passed since then.

283
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,840
Mr. Zhai.

284
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,559
I want to make a bet with you today.

285
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,719
Go ahead.

286
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,000
I know that

287
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,159
the streamlining of personnel is Shangger's suggestion.

288
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,599
It's also for the good of our company.

289
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,599
I admit that

290
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,719
my employees' operational capabilities

291
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,880
are inferior to Department II.

292
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,919
But I promise that everyone will

293
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,320
improve their performance by 30%

294
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,599
within enough time.

295
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,760
If they failed,

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,640
I will resign.

297
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,400
This is your bet?

298
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,840
I'd like to call it a pledge.

299
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,359
Three months.

300
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,159
Only three months.

301
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:45,799
That's a deal.

302
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,200
Please.

303
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,320
-Okay. -Thank you. -You're welcome.

304
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,080
Dapang.

305
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,799
Do you think Qingyou knows about this?

306
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,520
I think so. She must know.

307
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,160
Qingyou is coming.

308
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,239
-Qingyou. -Qingyou. -Qingyou.

309
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:07,880
Qingyou.

310
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,959
We are safe now.

311
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,640
We're saved by you and Mr. Mo.

312
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,479
Yeah.

313
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,760
I saw Mr. Zhai and Mr. Mo

314
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,959
discussing the personnel restructuring.

315
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,199
Qingyou,

316
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,520
did you make a pledge for us?

317
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Mr. Mo said

318
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,479
that he could give us another chance

319
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,520
to prove ourselves.

320
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,839
It's unexpected that

321
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,000
Mr. Mo always maintains a poker face,

322
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,280
but he shows humanity at the crunch time.

323
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,520
Yeah.

324
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,160
Mr. Mo is coming.

325
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,319
Let's work.

326
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,520
Yeah, we should work now.

327
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:34,760
Mr. Mo.

328
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:36,959
Ummm...

329
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:39,760
You're welcome.

330
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,719
Can I invite you to eat together?

331
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,640
To express my gratitude.

332
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,239
No, thanks.

333
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,680
I'm a callous workaholic.

334
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,359
No need to express your gratitude.

335
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,880
I'm so sorry.

336
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,839
I didn't know you before.

337
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
If you don't know me, why do you judge me?

338
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,400
You do owe me a serious apology.

339
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,439
I'll choose the restaurant.

340
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,119
Miss Goddess, are you coming to Xu Wei?

341
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:32,959
He is in class.

342
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,800
Yeah, I'm here for him.

343
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,760
Sorry.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,719
Failed to hold back.

345
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,800
Don't be so shy.

346
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,599
I've seen you in open crotch pants
when you were young.

347
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,319
What's wrong?

348
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,839
Didn't you say that you were occupied today?

349
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,800
I am suddenly free.

350
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,880
I drove the car today,

351
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,000
so I can pick you up by the way.

352
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,400
If you are busy, we can change it to another day.

353
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,079
That's okay.

354
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,400
I will change clothes right away.

355
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,319
I'm waiting for you in the car.

356
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:14,239
You're so beautiful. I can't stay here.

357
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,079
-Sir. -Sir.

358
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,839
Is that your girlfriend?

359
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,359
Kids, that's none of your business.

360
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,319
Keep your drawing.

361
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,119
Come here.

362
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,079
Why did your goddess come to you today?

363
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,119
You confessed to her?

364
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,560
Not yet.

365
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,839
I made money and planned to invite her to dinner.

366
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,920
I didn't expect that she just came here without asking.

367
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,079
I'm totally a loser.

368
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,079
Don't be silly.

369
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,479
The opposite is true.

370
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,359
According to my experience,

371
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,880
she has an interest in you.

372
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,680
What kind of interest?

373
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
That kind of interest you expected.

374
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,520
Aren't you single all the time?

375
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,040
How did you get the experience

376
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,359
of that interest?

377
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,239
I've never had a girlfriend,

378
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:54,920
but I've studied on it.

379
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,439
This is the fruit of my years of research

380
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,719
on young girls-oriented comic books.

381
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,079
Come here, let me

382
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,280
teach you a few tricks.

383
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,319
Assorted sashimi, charcoal grilled wagyu beef.

384
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,719
Foie gras salad.

385
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,079
Prepare the dishes in advance.

386
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,560
As soon as the guest comes, serve quickly.

387
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,040
Okay.

388
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,239
Is Director Xu in a hurry?

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,560
Your gratitude is not sincere enough.

390
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,280
For investors, time is money.

391
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,560
You have many affairs every day,

392
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,280
so I've arranged everything for you.

393
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,839
Do you regard it as a mission

394
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,079
to have a meal with me?

395
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,719
You're only half right.

396
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,199
I misunderstood you.

397
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,160
I am sorry.

398
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
Thank you for your tolerance.

399
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,280
Sincerity is an essential part of an apology.

400
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,479
Impatience leads to mistakes.

401
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,959
A hasty conclusion

402
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,239
is inclined to inaccuracy.

403
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,920
You can't just look at the surface.

404
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,280
You reproached me first,

405
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,160
and then helped me.

406
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,239
It seems that your motivation

407
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,800
to help Lemi and me is not simple, right?

408
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,000
Go ahead.

409
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,199
You will definitely not agree
with my view of connections.

410
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,640
Before making the choice,

411
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:08,199
you've already analyzed the pros and cons.

412
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,119
Three months.

413
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,479
If I can realize my promise,

414
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,280
you can gain a firm foothold in Shangger.

415
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,479
If I fail and leave here,

416
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,439
you won't lose anything.

417
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,040
Director Xu, don't forget

418
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,439
the pledge you've made.

419
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,719
Three months.

420
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,920
I hope that

421
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,560
you won't be my biggest risk.

422
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,239
Of course, just rest assured.

423
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,640
You're so smart,

424
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,680
why don't you give up in time

425
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,479
but buy in when facing losses?

426
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,800
Just a choice.

427
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,520
It doesn't matter whether I'm smart or not.

428
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,359
Okay.

429
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,280
Take it off if you feel uncomfortable.

430
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:10,880
No.

431
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,760
The etiquette is important

432
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,239
because you're my guest.

433
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,319
Look at your dirty hands.

434
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,760
Don't mention the etiquette.

435
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,319
You stay the same

436
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,359
like in childhood. Give me your hand.

437
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,160
If a girl likes you,

438
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,040
she won't reject contact with you physically.

439
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,359
Okay.

440
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,479
Hey, what are you thinking?

441
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:48,839
Nothing.

442
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,439
Why not order? I'm hungry.

443
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,520
You're so generous.

444
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,800
These dishes are expensive.

445
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,160
You deserve it.

446
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,560
If I can make a lot of money,

447
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,719
I'll take you to better restaurants.

448
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,439
In that case,

449
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
you order today.

450
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,319
Me?

451
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,839
If she asks you to order,

452
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,040
it shows that

453
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,719
she is dependent on you.

454
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,719
Waiter.

455
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,760
Can I help you?

456
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,079
I wanna this one, this one

457
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,400
and that one.

458
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,439
Okay, wait a minute.

459
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:39,760
Thank you.

460
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:40,520
Thank you.

461
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,959
Good for you, very generous.

462
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,920
You're rich now.

463
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,880
Of course.

464
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,959
I must let you feel over-fed today.

465
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,839
Feel over-fed after a French meal?

466
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,520
Stop kidding.

467
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,319
I'll come back soon.

468
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,319
The last

469
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,920
and also the most important point is that

470
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,000
if a woman likes a man,

471
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,239
she will deliberately create a chance

472
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,880
to get close to him.

473
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,560
Good job, man.

474
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,839
If the above three points are met...

475
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,719
Congratulations, lad.

476
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,760
Do not hesitate.

477
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,119
Come on.

478
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,359
Date with her.

479
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,959
Date with her.

480
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,439
Your sincerity is not enough today.

481
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,119
Then?

482
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,119
Drive for me.

483
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,719
I'm not a good driver.

484
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,280
Well, you're licensed.

485
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,640
It's more convenient to look at me this way.

486
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,280
What? I'm not looking at you.

487
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,359
I'm looking at the cars behind.

488
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,319
Is there a car?

489
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,400
I can't find one.

490
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,839
Oh, it flew away just now.

491
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,239
Ummm,

492
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,239
are you free on weekends?

493
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,000
Want to invite me to eat again?

494
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,839
If your sister knows that
you've spent so much money treating me,

495
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,760
she'll scold me.

496
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm told that

497
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:34,920
there's an interesting exhibition.

498
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,359
Do you want to go there with me?

499
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,079
Weekends are so precious,

500
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,719
why not rest at home?

501
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,760
There's something on your face.

502
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,239
Just like a kid.

503
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,959
And your hairstyle.

504
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,079
Now it's pleasing to the eye.

505
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,319
Bye,

506
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,239
it's my treat next time.

507
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,280
Hey,

508
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,560
Dayan.

509
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
I'm in love.

510
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,160
Since the trailer of Meeting Your Match

511
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,040
was released,

512
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:48,160
it has become a hit online.

513
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Many netizens ask us

514
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:55,239
to hold related activities.

515
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,439
Social attention means more customers.

516
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,239
We can satisfy

517
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:02,040
some wishes of netizens.

518
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,719
It seems that an increase of 30%

519
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:07,239
in our performance will come true.

520
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:09,839
How about a live webcast?

521
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,880
I vote for it!

522
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,239
A day of the ideal boyfriend.

523
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:13,959
I vote for it.

524
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,479
Come on.

525
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:17,479
Let's check the guy who ranks first,

526
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,239
and make a live webcast of his work and life.

527
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,040
Okay.

528
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,230
Let's take a look at the most concerned man.

529
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:23,760
(Ranking: Mo Lingze, Chen Qingyun,
Li Zeyu, Bai Dushu)

530
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,719
Mr. Mo.

531
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,160
He deserves it.

532
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Mr. Mo is low-key.

533
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,719
Don't ride his wave.

534
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,040
Ummm...

535
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,160
But he is very handsome. The champion.

536
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,920
Think about other options.

537
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,839
I sent gifts to your front desk.

538
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,640
Remember to get it.

539
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,560
Director Xu, these are for you.

540
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,680
So many.

541
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,680
Hello?

542
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,239
Hairy crabs are the best at this time.

543
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,719
You guys are busy with work lately.

544
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,359
Take it to your colleagues

545
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,599
to cheer them up.

546
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,199
Thank you.

547
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Don't say socail formulas.

548
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,040
I'm scared when you say thank you.

549
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,319
It sounds like I do something wrong again.

550
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,040
It's okay, continue your work.

551
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,359
Okay, bye.

552
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:28,400
Lawyer Fan.

553
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,400
You are so busy at work,

554
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,079
and still remember to order hairy crabs
for your girlfriend.

555
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,839
What a good boyfriend.

556
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,119
Coaxing girlfriend is just like maintaining customers.

557
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,719
It needs methods.

558
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,599
It seems that you know everything well.

559
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,599
I believe that you will succeed in the acquisition of DDS.

560
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,839
Please rest assured.

561
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,640
I have the confidence.

562
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,760
Whether a lawsuit or a person, I will never lose.

563
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,160
Okay.

564
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,239
Qingyou.

565
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,680
I've seen men taking flowers as gifts for girls,

566
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,439
but I've never seen anyone sending hairy crabs.

567
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,359
Lawyer Fan is very special.

568
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,079
Do you like it?

569
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,000
Yes.

570
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,719
Help me take them in.

571
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay.

572
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,959
These are heavy.

573
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,239
Qingyou.

574
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,160
Although we have our dignity

575
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,760
and never ride wave,

576
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:18,680
after all,

577
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,640
Mr. Mo has helped us so much.

578
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:23,520
We should show thanks to him.

579
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,719
You're right.

580
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,880
How about the live webcast?

581
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,079
No,

582
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,599
I don't want to eat my words.

583
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,199
Gift.

584
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:33,920
Ready-made.

585
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,439
(Mo Lingze )
Where are you?

586
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,839
I have a gift for you.

587
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,640
There is no free lunch.

588
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,839
I dare not accept your gift.

589
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,920
(Fang Qi)
Where is the Poker Face?

590
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
You're the representative
from Golden Sun Capital mentioned by Mr. Luo?

591
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:23,640
It's me.

592
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,640
Surprise!

593
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,239
Lingze.

594
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,959
Let's have French food later, okay?

595
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,079
Well,

596
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,800
you are afraid that someone will be jealous?

597
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,920
Lin Siyu.

598
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,400
I warned you last time.

599
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,839
You and Xu Qingyou...

600
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,959
Mr. Luo asked me to come here.

601
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,400
He definitely not aimed to give you a chance

602
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,640
to ask me these questions.

603
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,920
Good for you.

604
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,520
He asked me to be your lobbyist.

605
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,280
I can help you find investors

606
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,439
to support your project.

607
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
As long as you ask me,

608
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm willing to offer you a favour.

609
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,920
I don't need your favour.

610
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,800
I never depend on connections to make projects.

611
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,439
And you used to work for me.

612
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,880
It's against the rules.

613
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,839
I am willing to break any rules for you.

614
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,839
I can't accept it.

615
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,599
Your objection is none of my business.

616
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,959
(Xu Qingyou)
I'll wait for you at the front desk of the coffee shop.

617
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,640
Sorry, I have some affairs.

618
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:23,800
Wait!

619
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,400
Mr. Mo, a gift to thank you.

620
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,560
Hairy crabs.

621
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,160
Director Xu.

622
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,599
I can't accept it.

623
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,359
Is it your first time to be an apple-polisher？

624
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,560
Our acquisition of DDS is counting on you.

625
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,599
Golden Sun Capital has also entered the game.

626
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,319
Golden Sun Capital.

627
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,160
How many shares do we have now?

628
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,800
Although there will be an 18% reduction,

629
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,880
the risk will also be reduced accordingly.

630
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,599
I think we've

631
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,640
achieved an equilibrium with the current stock.

632
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,400
Lawyer Fan.

633
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,400
Have you heard of Zhao Lei?

634
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,920
The deputy general manager of Investment Dept.
in Golden Sun Capital.

635
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,560
Mo lingze's rival.

636
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,400
If you can

637
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,160
send this person to us,

638
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,959
let alone the deputy general manager,

639
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,400
what can Mr. Luo do to us?

640
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,439
Being anxious to gain a foothold

641
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,239
will inevitably show weaknesses.

642
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,680
Friend or foe,

643
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:57,079
just wait and see.

644
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,160
We're counting on you.

645
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,079
Aha,

646
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,319
congratulations to your marriage in advance.

647
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,359
We're still preparing.

648
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,679
Remember to bring your fiancée out

649
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:13,879
to let me know.

650
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,879
I know you've been together for ten years.

651
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,919
You're so persistent.

652
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,360
Being persistent is kid's lie.

653
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,239
It's been a long time.

654
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,280
She has been shaped as my thoughts.

655
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,360
Shape?

656
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,560
It's like customizing a piece of clothing.

657
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,320
From measurements to tailoring,

658
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,040
it's been shaped for ten years.

659
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,080
She's the most suitable one.

660
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,520
Now I'm more curious about your girlfriend.

661
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm looking forward to your work.

662
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,280
Director Xu.

663
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,040
What's wrong?

664
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
About that incident...

665
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,360
Are you allergic to crabs?

666
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:06,760
Have you been hurt by them?

667
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,399
So you did it

668
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,399
on purpose.

669
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,800
You deliberately embarrassed me

670
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,879
and showed off your popularity, right?

671
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,679
You misunderstood it.

672
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,159
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

673
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,040
you've seen my gratitude.

674
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,639
That's it.

675
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,800
What are you doing?
