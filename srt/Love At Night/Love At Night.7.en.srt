3
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,400
Mr. Mo.

4
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,800
Why are you here?

5
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,319
Why can't I be here?

6
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,000
Mr. Mo comes here to check the advertising.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,480
You're really buried yourself to work, Mr. Mo.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,480
Come over to check on work 
even when the power is out.

9
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,519
No wonder you're so popular in Shangger.

10
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,839
Well,

11
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,440
I always take responsibility

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,519
for projects to the end.

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,040
My Youyou is afraid of the dark.

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,080
It's a good thing you're here.

15
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,199
Thanks.

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,680
No problem.

17
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
I have to go first.

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,279
Let me take you home.

19
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,199
Let's go.

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,639
It seems that Mr. Mo has helped you a lot.

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,559
I know you are co-workers.

22
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:47,720
But Youyou,

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,320
to be honest,

24
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,800
I don't like you getting too close to him.

25
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,720
I see.

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,360
I know what to do.

27
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,320
But we should show our gratitude to him.

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,119
We should have given him those hairy crabs.

29
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,639
I did so.

30
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,039
Glad to hear it.

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,800
Don't bother him anymore.

32
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,080
It's no good always bothering him.

33
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,679
Okay.

34
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,039
Mr. Mo.

35
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,559
The working time is arranged

36
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,199
from 9 am to 12 am.

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
The interview is at the end.

38
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,520
There will be staff to guide you there.

39
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,240
I won't spend three hours

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
on these trivial things.

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,839
No problem.

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,479
I can condense it into 2 hours.

43
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:56,839
Do it now.

44
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

45
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,639
Do it here.

46
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,759
Okay. No problem.

47
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,600
Make each step accurate to the minute.

48
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,880
I'll finish as soon as the time is up.

49
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,040
Okay.

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,959
If you want to stay away from trouble,

51
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,279
why do you come to me?

52
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
As the work required, that's all.

53
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,679
I hope others think so.

54
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,799
You should not worry about

55
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,079
what others think.

56
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,040
Done.

57
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:18,760
Hello?

58
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,480
Youyou.

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,279
I think I left a document at your place.

60
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,959
I need it in a hurry.

61
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Could you bring it over for me?

62
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,559
Okay.

63
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:30,880
Mr. Mo.

64
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,160
New legal agreement.

65
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,480
Okay.

66
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,600
What are you snapping?

67
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,839
Wang Ji.

68
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,359
Do you

69
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,920
fall in love with Poker Face?

70
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,200
Qi.

71
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,079
This is a trade secret.

72
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,239
I can't reveal a lot to you.

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,359
All I can say is

74
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm helping Mr. Mo

75
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,480
get married.

76
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,239
Who? So courageous.

77
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,399
A beauty falls from the sky.

78
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:37,799
Qi.

79
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,079
Is Director Xu Lawyer Fan's fiancée?

80
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,880
Yes. What's wrong?

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,519
Director Xu is Lawyer Fan's...

82
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,279
A beauty falls from the sky.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Striking news.

84
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,119
Have a meet.

85
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,920
Thank you a lot.

86
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,000
Such a long way.

87
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,160
Never mind.

88
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,359
You haven't eaten yet, right?

89
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Let's have lunch together.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
No, thanks.

91
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,519
I have work to do in company.

92
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,799
I have already planned it.

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,760
Come on.

94
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,119
Mr. Luo. Mr. Mo.

95
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,519
Mr. Luo.

96
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,720
Mr. Mo.

97
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,880
Softer please.

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,239
Pain.

99
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,399
It's not easy being a woman.

100
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,040
A man screams like a pig.

101
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Why do you come for me?

102
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,440
Is Lingze in trouble again?

103
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,959
Are you kidding?

104
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,760
Mr. Mo has a great ability to work.

105
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,600
Not long after he came to Shangger,
he settled several large investments.

106
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
So what's wrong?

107
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,000
Xu Qingyou has a fiancé.

108
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,119
Fiancé?

109
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,880
So. Don't worry anymore.

110
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,640
No, I can't.

111
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,480
Lingze is so charming.

112
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,920
That depends on who her fiancé is.

113
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,160
Who?

114
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,720
Our company's

115
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,160
famous financial lawyer, Fan Yunxi.

116
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,920
Really?

117
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,040
Believe it or not.

118
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,599
You did a good job.

119
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,239
Keep up the good work.

120
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,359
Stop it.

121
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,039
Mr. Mo has my loyalty.

122
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,039
What's more,

123
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,479
as a great Investment analyst,

124
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,039
how can I waste time in these

125
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,119
childish things.

126
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,280
This is about Lingze's happiness.

127
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,919
How can you take it as a childish thing?

128
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,719
Wouldn't you like to see me

129
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,280
living happily ever after with him?

130
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,640
How come I don't feel he likes you

131
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,479
at all these days?

132
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:06,760
You...

133
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,520
Lingze is an introverted person.

134
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,159
He doesn't write his feelings on his face.

135
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,960
A cold person like him

136
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,200
needs a warm little sun

137
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
like me to melt him.

138
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:27,840
Lawyer Fan.

139
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
Then I'm counting on you

140
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,919
for the DDS supplementary agreement.

141
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,559
Don't worry Mr. Luo.

142
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,400
I will do

143
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,520
what I have been asked to do for you.

144
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,479
This year,

145
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,719
good projects and investments are hard to find.

146
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:43,760
Luckily,

147
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
I got Lingze.

148
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,440
Although he is young,

149
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,479
he is a rare talent.

150
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,400
I've heard a lot about Mr. Mo.

151
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,520
He helped Golden Sun 
win 15 ace projects in three years.

152
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Awesome.

153
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,400
Thanks.

154
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,479
You are the leader of your field.

155
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,280
Lawyer Fan.

156
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,520
The most enviable thing about you

157
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,239
is that outstanding Director Xu

158
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,119
is your fiancée.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,960
It's lucky for me

160
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,840
to be with Youyou.

161
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Come on.

162
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Mo,

163
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,520
you're not young now.

164
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,320
In my opinion,

165
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,119
it's time to settle down with someone.

166
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,919
Mr. Luo.

167
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm a person who can be a trouble

168
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,760
for others.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,479
What kind of girl do you like?

170
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,520
One doesn't like mustard.

171
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,599
Don't you like mustard, Director Xu?

172
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,599
No, I like it.

173
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,760
Come on. Drink mine.

174
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,760
Mr. Mo's standard for a girlfriend

175
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,760
is quite special.

176
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,559
Come on.

177
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,080
Cheers.

178
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,000
Come on.

179
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,520
After all these years,

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,960
he doesn't even know you don't eat mustard.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,679
You are drunk.

182
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,760
Director Xu is a really

183
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,080
good actress.

184
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,119
Mr. Mo is not bad at flattering yourself.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,679
Is that fun?

186
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,760
Is it funny that your fiancé went to such lengths

187
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,159
to set up this dinner?

188
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,679
You think too much.

189
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,200
Aren't you clear  whether I think too much?

190
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,919
Is it fun to fool yourself?

191
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,359
Let me go.

192
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,919
You don't really think
you can reunite a broken mirror, do you?

193
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,599
It's my own business.

194
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,599
Sorry.

195
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,599
After Fan Yunxi showed me that you belong to him,

196
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,880
it's not your own business.

197
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,880
Xu Qingyou.

198
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,080
Do you feel good to force yourself?

199
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,400
What are you talking about?

200
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,760
Youyou.

201
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,119
Youyou.

202
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,359
Come in.

203
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,520
Don't create misunderstandings.

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,440
What are you doing?

205
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,119
Are you insane?

206
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,440
Maybe.

207
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,799
Maybe I am really crazy.

208
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,159
I could have been a bystander,

209
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,760
but now, I don't want to.

210
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,359
Isn't it good for you to remain an outsider?

211
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,520
If he really trusts you,

212
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,440
you don't have to hide like this.

213
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,559
Don't you think it's funny?

214
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,359
Youyou.

215
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,239
Youyou.

216
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,440
Do you have to force me?

217
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,679
Youyou.

218
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,960
Hello. Mr. Han.

219
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay.

220
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,559
Stop now.

221
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,320
You don't really think
you can reunite a broken mirror, do you?

222
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,239
After Fan Yunxi showed me that you belong to him,

223
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,599
it's not your own business.

224
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,039
Xu Qingyou.

225
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,799
Do you feel good to force yourself?

226
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,679
What's wrong?

227
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,080
You've been in a daze
since you came out of the restaurant.

228
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,880
Nothing.

229
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,599
I'm a little tired.

230
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,640
What's wrong?

231
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,280
Your lipstick is a little smudged.

232
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,039
Mr. Mo went to the washroom just now.

233
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:06,960
Did you see him?

234
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,400
No.

235
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,840
After Mr. Mo took over Lemi,

236
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,520
it seems that you are busier than before.

237
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,159
Mr. Mo has become

238
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,520
the general manager of Shangger at this age.

239
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,479
He must have some tricks up his sleeve.

240
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,000
But good qualities are important than abilities.

241
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,520
Mr. Mo is a man who, to put it nicely,

242
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,239
is unfathomable,

243
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,440
but to put it badly...

244
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,440
After the last proposal by Mr. Mo,

245
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
we did another in-depth communication with DDS

246
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
and amended the acquisition agreement.

247
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,559
They agreed

248
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,679
to turn the investment fund into convertible bonds

249
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,680
if the return does not meet the target.

250
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,000
Mo.

251
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,439
What do you see?

252
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
There is no problem with the agreement itself,

253
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,719
but

254
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,359
the three founders of DDS were college friends

255
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,920
and were once known as the Three Musketeers of Media.

256
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,479
But in the last year

257
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,920
the CEO has been missing

258
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,800
from any public appearances.

259
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:34,199
There is speculation
that there are factions between them.

260
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,160
It's all hearsay,

261
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,640
so don't worry about it.

262
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,760
The Chief Financial Officer had a birthday last month

263
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,520
and the CEO still wasn't present.

264
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,319
And he hinted on Twitter

265
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,400
that he was being gradually marginalized.

266
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,359
If their power struggle

267
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,280
leads to a split,

268
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,640
the future of DDS

269
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
may not be as bright

270
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,599
as we see it today.

271
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,040
In summary, I believe that

272
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,319
the DDS acquisition should be re-evaluated

273
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,359
and carefully considered.

274
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,319
Mr. Mo.

275
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,520
Many large companies have experienced

276
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,199
power struggles among their founders.

277
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,280
It doesn't affect the valuation of the company,

278
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,040
so it's a bit unprofessional of you

279
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
to draw such a conclusion.

280
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,439
Yeah.

281
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,800
If they had only been fighting for power,

282
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,719
it would not have been a problem.

283
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,400
But the other two founders

284
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,400
are always in the entertainment news.

285
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,760
On average, they held a pool party

286
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,719
once a week at Billiver Hills.

287
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,640
In an average of fifteen days,
they change a rumored girlfriend.

288
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
They also gambled, fought

289
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,520
and even created social incidents
such as spreading extremist opinions.

290
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,479
DDS has grown to this point,

291
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,640
which is based on the ability of its founders

292
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,319
rather than their private lives.

293
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,599
Mr. Mo must know well.

294
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,719
After all, I heard that Mr. Mo

295
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,959
has a very exciting private life too.

296
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,319
But when it comes to work,

297
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,719
you can still handle it,

298
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,680
and do it well.

299
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,160
I've never thought that

300
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,359
you are interested in my private life, Lawyer Fan.

301
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,839
In my opinion,

302
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,280
relationships and projects are the same.

303
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,280
Some are hard and some are easy.

304
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,959
But I met a hard one recently.

305
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,199
It's a little distractive.

306
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,599
Lawyer Fan.

307
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,760
The DDS acquisition is huge

308
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,640
and we will have to discuss it further.

309
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,319
I understand.

310
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,319
Goodbye.

311
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,239
I wonder if Mr. Mo is available for a private chat.

312
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,199
Okay.

313
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,160
What do you think of my Patek Philippe, Mr. Mo?

314
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:39,760
Good.

315
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,439
I'm a nostalgic person

316
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,560
who likes older things.

317
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,239
Patek Philippe was founded in 1839,

318
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,280
and DDS in 2000.

319
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,839
My fiancée and I have been together for ten years.

320
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:58,199
What do you want to say
in a roundabout way, Lawyer Fan?

321
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,959
My Youyou is an outstanding person.

322
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,479
People like her.

323
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,760
But like me,

324
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,479
she's a nostalgic person.

325
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,000
How many decades can a person have,

326
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,040
let alone the best of her youth?

327
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,119
Some things

328
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,680
are not so easily shaken.

329
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm no match for Lawyer Fan's ability

330
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,319
to manipulate people's hearts.

331
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,880
I only know the truth about stopping losses in time.

332
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:27,880
One

333
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,800
must always look ahead.

334
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,719
Relying on the past

335
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,040
to tie a person

336
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,400
is not a long-term solution.

337
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,719
I appreciate you,

338
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,520
so I kindly remind you

339
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:44,560
that if you do something
that is not in the right name,

340
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,880
you may lose your reputation

341
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,400
as a human being.

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,119
Thanks for the warning.

343
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
In investment,

344
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,640
the position of the banker and the seller,

345
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,359
and the control plate and the controlled plate 
changes rapidly.

346
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,160
Reversals

347
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,400
happen all the time.

348
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,760
So,

349
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,680
see your own position clearly, Lawyer Fan.

350
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,119
Goodbye.

351
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,839
Qingyu. The factory said

352
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,079
it would take three days of extra work to finish.

353
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,040
There is no problem with the sample.

354
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,000
But could they be quicker?

355
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,800
I've asked for it several times.

356
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,959
I'll call them later

357
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,680
to ask if they can finish in two days.

358
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,000
Have a try.

359
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,880
What happens? Who is this?

360
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:38,719
What's this?

361
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:39,760
What's this?

362
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:41,920
What happens?

363
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,079
It is Lawyer Fan who bought us coffee and cake.

364
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,439
Lawyer Fan said he would like to thank everyone

365
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,880
for taking care of our Qingyou.

366
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,800
Please take care of her in the future.

367
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay, okay, okay.

368
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,239
Qingyou is so happy.

369
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,359
We get benefits from her.

370
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,800
Qingyou.

371
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,920
Lawyer Fan is too considerate.

372
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,040
When you have your wedding,

373
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,680
make sure you invite

374
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,160
all of us, okay?

375
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,760
Yeah.

376
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,520
Qingyou.

377
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,640
Give it away.

378
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,359
Finish your cake and get to work.

379
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,359
Okay. Mr. Zhai.

380
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,079
Come on. Come on.

381
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,040
I want that flower.

382
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,000
So beautiful.

383
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,000
It's tasty when it's pretty.

384
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Yeah. How enviable!

385
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,280
This is a real quick fix.

386
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,800
(Xia Feng: Congratulations to Youyou and Lawyer Fan)
Fan Yunxi really has a knack.

387
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,000
I feel all my private life

388
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,640
was exposed recently.

389
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,520
It's his oath of sovereignty.

390
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,160
Just now at the meeting,

391
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,400
he was debating with Mo Lingze.

392
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,319
I'm in bad mood,

393
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,800
can we stop talking about him?

394
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,880
Xu Qingyou.

395
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,680
This is called having a wolf in front

396
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,000
and a tiger at the back.

397
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,040
You are this.

398
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,000
You're looking for a fight.

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,599
Why do you go to another company
during your lunch break?

400
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
I forgot my phone.

401
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,920
I gotta go.

402
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,800
Sorry about

403
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,119
last night.

404
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:26,800
No problem.

405
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,520
Everyone can get drunk.

406
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,800
As long as Mr. Mo doesn't cross that line,

407
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,280
we're still good partners.

408
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,920
What if I am a person
with a poor sense of distance by nature

409
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,680
and a bad sense of self-constraint,

410
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,760
and cross this line.

411
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,359
What would you do?

412
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,800
Then forget those things.

413
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,040
Xu Qingyou.

414
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,760
Are you happy now?

415
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,040
Mr. Mo.

416
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
Does it matter to you
whether I'm happy or not?

417
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,359
Okay.

418
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,719
As you wish.

419
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
I respect you.

420
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,000
And I respect your line.

421
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,959
A glass of Karuizawa, on me.

422
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,000
Fifty two?

423
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,520
Think too much.

424
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:55,719
I put it here.

425
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,160
What're you thinking?

426
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,119
Are you thinking about women?

427
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,199
Can you give your guitarist

428
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,479
a little privacy?

429
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,319
(Xu Qingyou)
Mr. Mo.

430
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,560
(Xu Qingyou

431
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,199
(Xu Qingyou)
The following shot is going to start at 9 am.

432
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,520
Are you available?

433
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,640
Okay.

434
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,640
I think you are serious this time.

435
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,920
Isn't winning, challenging, and risk-taking

436
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,839
your credo in life?

437
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:57,959
What do you mean?

438
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,079
It's drawing the line.

439
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,800
Bobo's grandfather

440
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,439
is 82 years old now.

441
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,920
Do you know what is his secret of longevity?

442
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,439
Because

443
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,439
his grandfather only minds his own business.

444
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,680
Mo Lingze. You are really mean.

445
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm gonna hire a new guitarist.

446
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,439
You'd better be quick.

447
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,160
Be sure to check the positions of both cameras.

448
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,040
And Xiaopang,

449
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,319
are you ready to direct the bullet comments?

450
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,359
No problem.

451
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,800
Mr. Mo is hard to deal with.

452
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,400
He...

453
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,280
It's hard for Mr. Mo
to have a chance to work with us.

454
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,439
We must be 120 percent enthusiastic.

455
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,239
Go for it.

456
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,479
Good morning, Mr. Mo.

457
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
You've been working very hard, Director Xu.

458
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,319
Sorry for you all

459
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,839
that I'm hard to deal with.

460
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,800
Let's start.

461
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,839
Mr. Mo. This way please.

462
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,599
Some years ago,

463
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,400
the whole industry focused on some

464
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,560
big heavyweight companies

465
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,079
and the trend was to follow the investment.

466
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,400
In the past two years,

467
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,760
everyone

468
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,479
has focused on

469
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:05,839
companies in more niche and vertical areas.

470
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,439
For example, our Shangger chose Lemi.

471
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
It's a good proof of that.

472
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:12,079
I've heard that Lemi is having a lot of problems

473
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:12,880
to go public.

474
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,000
Is this a downside

475
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,880
to investing in lightweight companies?

476
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,239
No aircraft carrier

477
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,400
is built in one day.

478
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,599
There are bound to be its share
of hardships and dangers.

479
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,839
And the success of Lemi is the best proof of this.

480
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,800
Qingyou.

481
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,319
Mr. Mo's live data explodes.

482
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,199
(Want to marry him)
All praise for him.

483
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,920
(So handsome. My king)
They say he is professional and charming.

484
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,760
Look.

485
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,920
Some female fans

486
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,160
say he's the new ideal type,

487
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,199
new national husband.

488
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,199
The more charming he is the less controllable he is.

489
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
People like him are only to be seen from a distance.

490
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,800
If you get close to him,

491
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,959
you can't stand it and you can't understand him.

492
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,680
Qingyou.

493
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,319
You admit that

494
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,079
Mr. Mo is charming?

495
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,199
Pang.

496
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Do you have some trouble

497
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,400
in understanding?

498
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,079
Nothing wrong.

499
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:17,400
Mr. Mo. What's the future plan of Shangger?

500
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,599
In the next three years, Shangger

501
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
will mainly target emerging industries in the Internet,

502
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,839
biomedical...

503
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,959
I'll take a call.

504
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,160
Hello?

505
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
I'm working. What's wrong?

506
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,239
Are you busy with Mo Lingze's live broadcast?

507
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,319
Hope the company can be satisfied.

508
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,800
Mr. Mo is indeed very elegant on the surface,

509
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,760
but he is unscrupulous

510
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,920
and has a very bad reputation in the industry,

511
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,400
so beware of him

512
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,160
and don't get too close to him.

513
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:44,880
I won't.

514
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:46,599
By the way,

515
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,040
how did everyone like the coffee and snacks

516
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,959
yesterday?

517
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,359
Yunxi.

518
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,400
I want to talk to you about something.

519
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,079
If you want to do something,

520
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,439
could you let me know in advance?

521
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,319
This is a company, after all.

522
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,239
Sorry.

523
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,000
I haven't done it considerately.

524
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,319
I just want you to be happy.

525
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,199
We really need some time and patience

526
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,719
if we want to go back to the way things were.

527
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,239
Just give each other a little more time, okay?

528
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,400
Okay.

529
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,199
I'm going to work.

530
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,000
Bye-bye.

531
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:26,479
Bye-bye.

532
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,640
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

533
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:40,680
Let's go.

534
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,959
Thank you for your support, Mr. Mo.

535
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,079
Very good data.

536
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,439
My pleasure.

537
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,319
It's good that Director Xu is not disappointed.

538
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,959
She won't.

539
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,719
So many people have complimented you, Mr. Mo.

540
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,959
Even our Director Xu admits

541
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,479
that you have charisma.

542
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,880
She said you are too attractive

543
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
and can only be seen from afar.

544
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,040
Mind your words.

545
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,880
It's rare

546
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,640
for Director Xu to say that about me.

547
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
Just kidding.

548
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
Don't take it seriously, Mr. Mo.

549
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,199
Director Xu's words should be taken seriously.

550
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,520
Only you can speak!

551
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,479
I...

552
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,359
Go.

553
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,920
You said you wouldn't eat.

554
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,560
Why did you take mine?

555
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,439
Mind your own business.

556
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,520
Instead of teaching children to draw at school,

557
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
why do you come with me to do due diligence?

558
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,359
Are you very idle?

559
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,439
I ruined your blind date last time.

560
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,079
So I'm here to make amends.

561
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,040
Ice cream.

562
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,920
I'll buy you as much as you want.

563
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,599
I don't want to have it. I just have a taste.

564
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,319
Having too much is bad for my health.

565
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,520
Women

566
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,599
are all duplicitous animals.

567
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,040
Who are you calling duplicitous?

568
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,280
I'm duplicitous?

569
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,280
Aren't you?

570
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,319
You said you won't eat. But you're eating.

571
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:05,839
What!

572
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,359
The clothes are costly.

573
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,319
And you wanted to smear it on my face?

574
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:11,160
Do you wanna die? Wipe that off.

575
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,560
You kid.

576
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,479
So naughty.

577
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,359
The bag we saw was pretty good.

578
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,439
Change this old one.

579
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,520
Thank you darling.

580
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,640
Fang Qi.

581
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,040
Long time no see.

582
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,359
Long time no see.

583
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:39,599
This is my...

584
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,359
I know her.

585
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:41,520
Hello.

586
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,079
I'm Qu Kai's fiancée, Yinyin.

587
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,959
You're waiting me to wipe your hands right?

588
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:56,760
Okay.

589
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,880
Hello. I'm Fang Qi's fiancé, Xu Wei.

590
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,800
Hello, Qu Kai.

591
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,839
I've heard of you from my Fang Qi.

592
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,599
By the way,

593
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,359
thanks to you that I can be with Fang Qi.

594
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,239
But we have things to do. We gotta go.

595
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,400
Let's go.

596
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,760
Be careful with this advertising.

597
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,119
Here. This plan is unqualified.

598
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:36,760
Qingyou. Here.

599
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,439
Make the last check.

600
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:44,839
Okay. All right.

601
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,439
Check with the advertising department.

602
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:46,959
Make it online the day after tomorrow.

603
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:47,439
Okay.

604
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,239
Qingyou.

605
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,800
Mr. Zhai had cost a lot this time.

606
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,839
He bought out all the bus hard advertisements space.

607
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,800
This is Lemi's annual project.

608
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
360 degrees full coverage.

609
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,079
Qingyou.

610
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,560
The printing plant for our bus ads

611
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,079
has an accident with the circuit
and can't produce the materials.

612
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,319
What do you mean they can't produce the materials?

613
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,599
All the bus hard advertisements

614
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,800
that we ordered

615
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,920
can't be produced in time.

616
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:11,680
It's...

617
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:12,719
Find...

618
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,040
Hurry up and find a printer near us.

619
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,439
See if there's one that can save the day.

620
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,920
It must be finished by 12 o 'clock tomorrow.

621
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,079
-Hurry. -Okay.

622
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:18,920
Come on.

623
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,280
Hello.

624
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,160
It's Lemi.

625
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,280
Hello. We would like to order an expedited print.

626
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,199
Closed?

627
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Could you tell me why?

628
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,280
Okay, okay. Thanks.

629
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,000
Hello.

630
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,000
Sorry.

631
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,000
Hello.

632
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,359
We want to print some advertisements.

633
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,719
Price negotiable, as soon as possible.

634
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,319
Hello.

635
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:40,800
Okay.

636
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:43,680
Bad news. Qingyou.

637
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,280
Most of the city's qualified printers

638
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,760
have been shut down due to safety inspections.

639
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,040
Qingyou.

640
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,079
Small factories can't take urgent orders,

641
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,359
and not all the colors are available.

642
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,359
Keep finding.

643
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:56,439
Okay.

644
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:58,239
Xu Wei.

645
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,920
Do you know a printer

646
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,839
who can take urgent orders?

647
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:06,719
Mr. Mo.

648
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,959
It's the information for tomorrow's meeting.

649
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,080
All on this flash drive.

650
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,600
Okay.

651
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,320
Hello.

652
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,360
We want some urgent materials.

653
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,239
Could you take this order?

654
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:16,199
Hello, Xu Wei.

655
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,840
Hello, sister.

656
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,560
Dayan found one that could take urgent orders.

657
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,239
And it meets your high standards.

658
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,320
Great.

659
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Where?

660
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,439
I'll send you on WeChat.

661
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,360
It's a bit far away and you need to get there quickly.

662
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,080
I'll be there soon.

663
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,719
Don't bother. I'll do it myself.

664
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,679
Just a trifling matter.

665
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,800
Don't make a fuss.
