3
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,959
Darn, Wang Ji!

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,639
Why did you turn me down?

5
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,559
Miss Lin.

6
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,839
You've been here for two days,

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,440
talking about Wang Ji.

8
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,480
Why don't you

9
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,879
ask him out?

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,519
He doesn't deserve it.

11
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,400
Give me a glass of See You Tomorrow.

12
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
Are you sure you want this?

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,559
Make it double.

14
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:11,960
Thanks.

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,199
Thanks.

16
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,240
Where is Mo Lingze?

17
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,160
Thought you were dating.

18
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,199
Had a fight?

19
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,399
I didn't know you two could fight.

20
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,160
Finally, it's my turn to have fun of onlookers!

21
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:02,960
Men?

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,080
Unworthy.

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,839
If only she were a man.

24
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,800
Pushed me away the other day,

25
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,960
now showed up again, what for?

26
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,440
I got a couple of hot guys in there

27
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
to talk to.

28
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,320
Excuse me, if you don't have anything to say.

29
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,279
Don't you want to start a business?

30
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,079
Why hit the bar every day

31
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,959
and got yourself dead drunk?

32
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
Did you come all the way down here

33
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,480
to lecture me?

34
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,440
I didn't mean that.

35
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,279
I mean,

36
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,399
you're so sweet and innocent.

37
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,880
What if someone picked on you

38
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
when you were drunk.

39
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,640
Now that you know I'm sweet and innocent,

40
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,559
why did you refuse me?

41
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,160
I didn't mean to.

42
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,559
I just wanted to be alone

43
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,760
and think it over.

44
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Do you have your mind made up now?

45
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,559
If you really want to start a business,

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,640
I can help you.

47
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,040
Really?

48
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Don't lie to me!

49
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,640
Why did you turn me down earlier?

50
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,480
What made you change your mind?

51
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,160
Why?

52
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,799
Why do you have so many questions?

53
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,799
Why? Why? Why?

54
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Then I don't ask why.

55
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,000
Were you fired by Mo Lingze?

56
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
So you came to me for shelter?

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,760
No.

58
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,359
Then you...

59
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,160
Then you have a thing for me!

60
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,200
No.

61
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,279
You want to have a relationship with me!

62
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,079
No.

63
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,959
Then why?

64
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,239
You're so wild.

65
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,040
This game

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,359
made me so tired!

67
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,160
I don't know why

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
you guys like it so much.

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,239
It seems you are angry.

70
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you okay?

71
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,959
There's just one thing I can't figure out.

72
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,399
I got Mo Lingze a birthday present today.

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
But he was not happy.

74
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,640
Mo Lingze's never celebrated a birthday.

75
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,279
To be exact,

76
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,920
since he was eighteen,

77
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,839
he's never celebrated birthday.

78
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,640
For many people,

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,440
birthdays are fond memories.

80
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,720
But for him,

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,559
it's not.

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,679
Tomorrow is your birthday.

83
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,040
What kind of gift do you want?

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,559
I want you and Mom

85
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,000
to come to my piano competition tomorrow.

86
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,440
Tomorrow,

87
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,119
Mom and Dad will be watching your competition,

88
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,079
and then we'll celebrate your birthday together.

89
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,480
I have got to go.

90
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,679
Take care of Lingze.

91
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,399
Then?

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,799
I don't know.

93
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,519
Last time he was drunk

94
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,959
so he told me a little bit.

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,720
He's never mentioned it to me.

96
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,880
This game,

97
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,799
you're the only one who beat his record.

98
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,959
You should have faith in yourself!

99
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,200
Got it?

100
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,210
(Mo: Text me when you get home. I will explain to you 
when I get back tomorrow)

101
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,810
(Xu: I'm alright. I've arrived home. 
Waiting for you to come back tomorrow)

102
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,399
If it wasn't for the hassle of ordering takeout,

103
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,600
I wouldn't eat any of these things you cooked.

104
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
(When the last meal is finished, 
I will be summoned to come back to you)

105
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
(To Xu Wei: Summon my boyfriend.
If you don't text back, I will not talk to you anymore)

106
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,479
You didn't reply my message.

107
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,799
Let alone "summoning"!

108
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,000
Did something happen to him?

109
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,880
What a terrible weather! Unpredictable rain!

110
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh my! Dear bro!

111
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,239
What took you so long?

112
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,679
Didn't you eat?

113
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,799
You did it on purpose!

114
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,359
Gu Da...

115
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,960
Good evening.

116
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,239
Am I late?

117
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,159
No, I haven't eaten dinner yet.

118
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,159
As soon as he saw me,

119
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,039
he said yes right away.

120
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,719
He said he was always looking for

121
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,840
a talented young man like me.

122
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,479
You caught the fancy of a big boss.

123
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,719
You're going to the top of your game.

124
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,039
Of course.

125
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,359
I have a feeling now.

126
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,719
If Peter Huang catches sight of this painting of mine,

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,760
I'm sure he'll be overwhelmed by my talent.

128
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,039
You have time for the fancy of big boss,

129
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,440
but leave no time for me at all, do you?

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,479
Didn't pick up the phone.

131
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,359
Didn't respond to my WeChat messages.

132
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,440
What do you mean?

133
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,760
I am sorry, Fang Qi.

134
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,760
I just got too immersed.

135
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,159
I painted from morning to night.

136
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,479
I forgot the time.

137
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,159
Just calm down.

138
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,479
You should smile.

139
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,760
You are pretty when you smile.

140
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,159
I am pretty when I smile.

141
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,239
I think, you are funny when you smile.

142
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,119
Don't.

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,119
I just wanted to surprise you.

144
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,039
Surprise me?

145
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,599
I think you wanted to frighten me.

146
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,960
Would you

147
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,919
go check your balance of IQ account?

148
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
You are kind of paying trafficker for trafficking you.

149
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,320
His trick,

150
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,760
we in the investment industry

151
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,640
have a terminology to describe.

152
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,080
You guess.

153
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,440
Get something from nothing.

154
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,840
It's not a terminology.

155
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,239
It's just a colloquialism!

156
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,280
You even don't know this colloquialism,

157
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,559
daydreaming overnight fame.

158
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,840
But Peter Huang,

159
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,640
he is a famous curator!

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,799
As long as he says my painting is good,

161
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,840
I will have a chance

162
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,039
to take part in the Pompidou Youth Art Exhibition.

163
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,679
Who has the final say then?

164
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,400
He?

165
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,919
Or the agent?

166
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,760
Or the media?

167
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,119
Or the netizens?

168
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,679
Or me?

169
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:58,960
Fine.

170
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,039
Even if someone really appreciates you,

171
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,640
but he kept it to himself

172
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,520
and then he turned his back on you.

173
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,919
What can you do about it?

174
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,359
Cunning!

175
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,159
Peter Huang!

176
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,039
I think he is Huang Shiren
( who is a notorious evildoer).

177
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Right.

178
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,239
Don't paint for Huang Shiren.

179
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,880
I'll think of something else.

180
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,159
You can look for other ways.

181
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:18,640
Ok?

182
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,840
Wait.

183
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,479
Fang Qi.

184
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,280
You punch me first.

185
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,799
Are you silly?

186
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,840
Because

187
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,840
I still want to finish my painting.

188
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,239
It's not for Peter Huang.

189
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,239
I did it for my own work.

190
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,119
I know,

191
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,919
I knew you'd be mad at me.

192
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,640
So you punch me first,

193
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,679
to drain your anger.

194
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:54,280
Since you made such a stupid decision,

195
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:58,000
then I have to

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,280
see you little fool

197
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,679
finish it.

198
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,000
So beautiful!

199
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,640
My work is so beautiful!

200
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,520
Fang Qi.

201
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,640
I'm gonna make you proud.

202
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,760
Director Xu,

203
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,880
I turned down two appointments,

204
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,719
and finished my work half a day earlier

205
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,559
just for giving you an explanation.

206
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,000
But I think I've changed my mind.

207
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,280
Not at the present time.

208
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,000
Not in this occasion.

209
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,760
But when you feel like telling me.

210
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,919
I'll wait.

211
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,919
What's wrong with it?

212
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,479
You should give me a hint at least.

213
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,760
Color is dark.

214
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,320
Meaning is unclear.

215
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,960
Not up to the standard of good works.

216
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,880
How to define the standard?

217
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,200
No matter what I draw,

218
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,880
you can make a quick comment with these words.

219
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,119
Don't you?

220
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,919
In artistic creation,

221
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,599
there is no single criterion,

222
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,320
but here

223
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,520
I am the only criterion.

224
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,820
(Please answer:)

225
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,320
(What's the silliest thing you've ever done 
for your requited love?)

226
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,039
In artistic creation,

227
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,520
there is no single criterion,

228
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,320
but here

229
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,479
I am the only criterion.

230
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,119
Did I forget to buy it?

231
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,119
I got it.

232
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,359
50 grams.

233
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,839
Mom,

234
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,119
does your medical soup work?

235
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,760
Have my dad tried it before?

236
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,319
Okay, I believe you.

237
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,040
How can't I believe you?

238
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,160
Okay.

239
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:26,800
Okay, mom.

240
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,599
I got it.

241
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,599
Thank you.

242
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:30,839
Bye.

243
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,079
You're sure you don't need my help?

244
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,119
Yes, I'm sure.

245
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,640
This is my home court today.

246
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Don't mess up my things.

247
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,280
You hear me?

248
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,119
Yes, Madam.

249
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,079
You watch your hands.

250
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,719
Don't worry.

251
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,239
How can you use a knife that small?

252
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,560
Would you just leave me alone?

253
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,560
Sorry.

254
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:56,719
Director Xu.

255
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,520
What?

256
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,839
There's a chopping knife in the back.

257
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you copy the second warning?

258
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,000
Maybe let me do it.

259
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:11,640
Don't move.

260
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,880
It's a matter of my dignity.

261
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
Sit down!

262
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,520
There's a new restaurant downstairs.

263
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,000
How about...

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,160
Shut up!

265
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,560
The kitchenware is really made in Germany.

266
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,520
The point was broken.

267
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Director Xu,

268
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,479
it's not about your dignity anymore.

269
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,119
It's a matter of my dignity now.

270
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,239
Don't move. Don't move.

271
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,359
-Be careful.  - Let me do this.

272
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,160
Don't. Don't.

273
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,000
Have a good rest.

274
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,760
Okay?

275
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,599
I don't need a rest.

276
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,280
I can do odds and ends.

277
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,000
Ok.

278
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,719
Here.

279
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,119
There's a knife point in there.

280
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
Got it.

281
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
so tired.

282
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,520
Leave it to me.

283
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,400
Though I'm not good at kitchen work,

284
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,640
I sweep floor well.

285
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,640
Yeah, I can tell.

286
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:46,319
I didn't think you really prepared a cake.

287
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,719
Of course.

288
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:48,800
Well.

289
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,079
Dare you taste your own cooking?

290
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,239
Certainly!

291
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:55,920
I'll drink it.

292
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,560
Leave it.

293
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,040
Let me have a try first.

294
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,079
No, you don't.

295
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,839
I have a boyfriend so hard to get,

296
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,319
whom I cannot afford to lose.

297
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,680
It makes sense.

298
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,319
Whatever you want to eat in the future,

299
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,599
I will cook it.

300
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:14,839
Yes, sir.

301
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,239
But I want to be nice to you.

302
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,839
I still have to learn cooking.

303
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,079
Alright.

304
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,199
Have a try.

305
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,920
This dish

306
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,839
was taught to me

307
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,479
by my mother.

308
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,199
On my eighteenth birthday,

309
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,959
my dad was taken by the police.

310
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:51,359
My mom got depression because of it.

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,839
Not long after,

312
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,959
she committed suicide.

313
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,040
Therefore,

314
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,439
for me,

315
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,000
birthdays don't mean happiness anymore.

316
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,280
Only,

317
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,599
only some

318
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,359
painful recollection.

319
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:24,760
Qingyou,

320
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,959
so I really didn't mean to embarrass you.

321
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,760
I am sorry.

322
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,880
I want to celebrate your birthday

323
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,920
because

324
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,160
I think

325
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,119
birthday is a very important day for a person.

326
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,680
We should be happy on that day.

327
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,640
But then I found out

328
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,920
we don't have to be happy

329
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
on a specific day.

330
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,800
If you have a bad memory

331
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:00,959
of the day,

332
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:02,719
let's just treat it

333
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,160
like just another day.

334
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,160
Mo Lingze.

335
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,800
I wish I could bring light to you.

336
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,800
Hopefully,

337
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,839
to shed a light on the 18-year-old Mo Lingze.

338
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,040
Xu Qingyou,

339
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,560
now,

340
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,439
you are my light.

341
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,479
Oh my, what are you doing here!

342
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,400
You...

343
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,119
You just scared me.

344
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,880
I didn't see this coming.

345
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Let me have a look.

346
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,119
Let's go.

347
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,400
Are you okay?

348
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,319
I didn't hit too hard.

349
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Don't you know

350
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,319
how hard you hit?

351
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,520
I didn't know it was you!

352
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,160
Sit. Sit.

353
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,079
Let me see it.

354
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,079
Let me check.

355
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:49,920
It's nothing at all.

356
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,160
Totally nothing.

357
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,319
You swear

358
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,640
what you're gonna do if I am disfigured.

359
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,839
If you are disfigured, I will still love you.

360
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,119
How was the art exhibition?

361
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,160
What did Peter Huang say?

362
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,640
He said my work wasn't up to his standards.

363
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,280
What are his standards?

364
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,760
What the hell is he?

365
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,719
It doesn't matter.

366
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,160
Let's not grieve for more than three seconds

367
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,000
over someone who doesn't deserve it.

368
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,680
I always knew he was unreliable.

369
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,280
So

370
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,800
I put you in touch with other sources.

371
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,920
I'll make calls right now.

372
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,599
Wait a minute.

373
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,079
I'm not done yet.

374
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:30,839
Excuse me,

375
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:31,959
I want to ask

376
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,359
do you know who is the painter of this artwork.

377
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,239
I am.

378
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,760
You got talent in the painting.

379
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,319
It instantly took me back

380
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,479
to my youth.

381
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,000
I smell love from it.

382
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm the curator of the Pompidou Youth Art Exhibition.

383
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,479
I'm looking for young domestic artists for exhibition.

384
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,000
Are you interested?

385
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,119
Yes! Yes!

386
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,560
Of course I do!

387
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:05,800
Well,

388
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,560
there may be some top people helping me,
what do you think?

389
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,520
Xu Wei.

390
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,239
You don't have to make up stories to comfort me.

391
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:17,880
I can get over it.

392
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,760
It's true!

393
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,599
I'm telling you

394
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,160
Mr. Pierre said that

395
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,359
my paintings will be previewed in the country.

396
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,560
Fang Qi.

397
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:31,760
You have to join me

398
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
for this historic moment.

399
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:36,640
Well,

400
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,079
I'll see

401
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,160
if I have work that day.

402
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,719
You are not kind.

403
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,599
It is only one day's work for you,

404
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,800
but my first step towards my dream!

405
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:48,280
It's not just one day's work, ok?

406
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,040
If so, going to your art exhibition

407
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,640
is just one art exhibition.

408
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,959
What day?

409
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,359
I am a busy manager.

410
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,079
Please make an appointment first.

411
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,680
You almost got me.

412
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,119
How dare you pinched my face!

413
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,040
You're just trying to piss me off.

414
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,319
What about you?

415
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,560
You are like that golden retriever I saw online.

416
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,520
When I ignore you,

417
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,599
your face crinkles up, so cute.

418
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
But when I smile at you,

419
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,479
you just come over and start rubbing.

420
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Who is the golden retriever?

421
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,439
That's because you haven't seen

422
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,880
my wild side.

423
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:40,760
Xu Wei.

424
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,520
Let's go.

425
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
What are you doing with my dress?

426
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,719
There's a dress code at the art exhibition.

427
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,280
Ladies have to wear dresses.

428
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,280
With this suit,

429
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,560
I can even get into a fancy western restaurant.

430
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,439
Can't I enter an art exhibition?

431
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,160
This is an art occasion.

432
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,479
And wearing dresses is a French custom.

433
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,079
I don't remember when I bought this dress.

434
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,599
Is this out of date?

435
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,719
As the saying goes, fashion is rebirth.

436
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,280
And I think it looks great on you.

437
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:18,719
Just give it a try.

438
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,239
Is this still fit?

439
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
The color is a little outdated, too.

440
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,520
Just try it.

441
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,479
Go. Go.

442
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,920
Don't lie to me.

443
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,280
How could I lie to you?

444
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,920
Just go.

445
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,359
If you are lying to me,

446
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,119
I will kill you.

447
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,079
When did I buy this dress?

448
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,439
Am I pretty?

449
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,520
Yes!

450
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,640
So perfect.

451
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,640
It's just a little bit flawed.

452
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,800
Where?

453
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,280
Sit down.

454
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,439
Don't move.

455
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,479
Come, raise your head.

456
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:42,520
Done.

457
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,239
Did you make it on my teeth?

458
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,359
Of course not.

459
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,040
You look good.

460
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,599
Let's go.

461
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,400
Wang Ji.

462
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,400
We got the Huayu case.

463
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:09,680
You continue following up.

464
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,000
(Tang Xi)

465
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,040
I got some important off-field information today.

466
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,199
You must love it.

467
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,719
Come to me.

468
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,160
I need to go talk to Tang Xi about work.

469
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,839
Can I, my dear girlfriend?

470
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:37,920
Permission granted.

471
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,280
Call me Your Royal Highness from now on.

472
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,800
I can't believe

473
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,920
the exhibition is in Xu Qingyou's alma mater and mine.

474
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,680
It's been too long.

475
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,520
It hasn't changed much.

476
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,199
Where are Xu Qingyou and Poker Face?

477
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,800
They'll come later.

478
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Gu Dayan went to pick them up.

479
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,199
She looks vaguely familiar.

480
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:06,719
Really.

481
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:07,839
See, it's her.

482
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,680
Is she that girl?

483
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,560
It's the same dress.

484
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,719
So romantic.

485
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,880
Do I have something dirty on my face?

486
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,319
Not on your face.

487
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,400
It's beside you.

488
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:18,800
I can't help.

489
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,119
I can't hide my charm anymore.

490
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,359
You are the dirt beside me.

491
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,319
I'll make you ginger tea.

492
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,400
Here we are.

493
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,319
Is this

494
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,280
an interpretation of a theme?

495
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,280
It's quite a unique idea.

496
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,079
What do they interpret?

497
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,719
True love.

498
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,520
True love?

499
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,800
Look at this.

500
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,160
This is it.

501
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,959
It's so beautiful here.

502
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,079
Where is it?

503
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,560
At the seaside.

504
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,839
Dutch style architecture.

505
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,959
What is it?

506
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,359
That's too abstract.

507
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,839
When I was in high school,

508
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,359
I visited you at your university once.

509
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,040
It was raining that day.

510
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,239
You came to me out of the rain and fog

511
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,719
with your umbrella

512
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,239
in this dress.

513
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,640
Thereafter,

514
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,560
I've seen a lot of good things since,

515
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,439
but nothing like you that day.

516
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Well, you

517
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,439
made my face a little longer.

518
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,599
I think not.

519
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,280
I think it looks like you.

520
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,359
Do you like it?

521
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,160
Why is it so beautiful?

522
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,319
Beautiful indeed.

523
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,160
Hi.

524
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,800
Our old apartment was torn down.

525
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,520
But the new one is the same as the old one.

526
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,359
So as soon as I get back,

527
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,760
I rented it.

528
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,239
Then I went to a lot of garage sales

529
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,680
to made it look like the old days.

530
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,400
What, what's wrong?

531
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,000
What, what...

532
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,119
You...

533
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:30,839
Stop it now.

534
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,359
It's time to rehearse.

535
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,640
This doesn't count!

536
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:39,920
What do you think?

537
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,359
Isn't it exactly the same?

538
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,400
Stop where you are

539
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,359
Stop!

540
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,359
-Don't let me catch you!  -Come on!

541
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,280
Come to catch me!

542
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,119
So memories can be refreshed.

543
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,079
Lingze.

544
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,800
Beef gruel with black pepper.

545
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,000
Tastes don't really change.

546
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,360
As usual.

547
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:32,679
You've gone too far!

548
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,439
How on earth can you give up?

549
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:39,760
Or you are pretending
that it's never happened,

550
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
so we can be together again?

551
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:43,840
Don't say angry words.

552
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,800
Angry words only prove
that you are not over it.

553
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,919
I just think you're naive.

554
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,199
Ms. Tang.

555
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:53,439
Can't you hear my rejection?

556
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:54,520
Rejection?

557
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,879
You helped me in business,

558
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:56,679
and adventured to save me.

559
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,919
You came as soon as I called.

560
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,040
Mr. Mo.

561
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,479
Is this a rejection?

562
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,000
I know Huayu's information is just a cover.

563
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,719
But I came to see you

564
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,439
because I wanted you to stop.

565
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,199
It's time to let go of everything.

566
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,840
Why would I let it go?

567
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Can you say

568
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,919
you've forgotten all about me?
