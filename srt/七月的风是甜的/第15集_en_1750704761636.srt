00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,600
Do you know how much money it costs to build this commercial street?

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
If we can't complete the contract,

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,000
we have to pay the commercial breach fee.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
I've calculated the accounts.

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,000
It's more meaningful to keep the homestay than the breach.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Bastard!

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,200
It can be developed into a unique homestay cultural experience center.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,800
In the future, not only can it attract tourists,

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,200
it can also be a commercial street that can lead more people to buy.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,400
It can even be a network of online shopping.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,200
From a long-term perspective, the potential of the business is infinite.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
From a long-term perspective, the company is not yours alone.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Which shareholder is willing to take the money and take the risk with you?

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,800
If you think the risk is great,

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
I can use my shares to guarantee it.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,800
If it fails,

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm willing to give up my shares and quit the board.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Then, let's settle it.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,600
Take the remodeling account and go to the homestay.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Take it down.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
You have to take it down.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:47,420
No

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,200
I think we should be ruthless to the board.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,400
As long as I stand in the yard,

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
I'll see who dares to move the homestay.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
That's not right.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,400
If the legal department comes, your identity will be exposed.

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,000
What should we do?

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
I think...

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Help!

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm warning you.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,200
Don't get involved in this matter.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Mr. Gu, don't make things difficult for me.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm just a worker.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,600
If the chairman knows, I can't afford it.

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Besides, how can I tell my family?

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
You said you were caught by an outsider.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
It's not the time.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Can you say something useful?

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
You'll stay here for a week.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
You can't go anywhere.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,200
I'll find someone to send you three meals a day.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,600
No, Mr. Gu.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I have to hold a parent's meeting for my son tomorrow.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,200
It's okay.

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,400
I'll do it for you.

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
The point is, you're so busy.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's no use.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,200
Mr. Gu, you also have a legal appointment.

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,000
What?

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
I think it's time to go.

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Let's go.

55
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,400
Hello.

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Are you Miss Song Qiyue?

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm the legal assistant of Gu Group.

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm here to discuss

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,000
the relevant issues of the reform project.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Reform?

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Who wants to reform?

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Gu Group?

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
According to the agreement,

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,600
the company is willing to compensate the business

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,200
for the loss caused by the project's reform.

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
How much can you give?

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
According to the assessment of the professional organization,

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,800
the discount is 2.3 million.

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't count this.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,800
It's up to our boss.

71
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
2.3 million?

72
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,400
Our annual rent is only 0.

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
It seems to be okay.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
How about this?

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
If we don't want to pay,

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
we can do it.

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
There's another way to make up for it.

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,600
You can choose the surface

79
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
of all the attractions and core business centers

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
under our group

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,400
and reopen the homestay one by one.

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
We can subsidize 80% of the costs

83
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,200
and expenses of the opening period.

84
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,400
But this place has our memories and feelings.

85
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
It's like home to me.

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
Go back and tell your boss

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
that we've made up our minds.

88
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Some things can't be measured with money.

89
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,600
2.2 million can't buy our homestay.

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
You two,

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
our boss asked me to inform you

92
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
not to negotiate.

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
No one is negotiating with you.

94
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Okay.

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
I will change your decision

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
and transfer it to the group.

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
Goodbye.

98
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
Duo Duo,

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,600
why are you sticking to the contract?

100
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
This is the last chance

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,600
I've ever had in my life.

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm not sticking to the contract.

103
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
This is my heart.

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
If our shop is on fire,

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
I'll hang it up in the shop.

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
The owner said

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
our shop once costed 2.3 million.

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,800
2.3 million!

109
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Can we make 2.3 million in our life?

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
I was too impulsive.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Impulsive? Who's impulsive?

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
What are you impulsive about?

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Isn't Gu Ci'an impulsive?

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
He's just a life-saving man.

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
It's none of your business.

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
No one is negotiating with you.

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Really?

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
I think

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
he was cute back then.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,400
He's cute now.

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Really?

123
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,200
Let me see.

124
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll go check.

125
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
I'll go check.

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Qi Yue,

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
actually,

128
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,400
my real identity

129
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,800
is the vice president of the group.

130
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,000
Fine.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm too hard.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Qi Yue,

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,800
the one who wants to change our homestay

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,200
is the president of the group, Gu Buli.

135
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
That's my dad.

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,400
This is too much of a scandal.

137
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
Qi Yue,

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
there's something I've been hiding from you.

139
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,400
I have to tell you now.

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,000
Actually, it's my dad's fault.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's wrong with your dad?

142
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
You heard everything?

143
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
I heard a lot.

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,600
You said you had something to hide from me.

145
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
Why is your face red?

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Oh, I know.

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,800
You think the timing isn't mature enough.

148
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
But your dad is already urging you.

149
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,200
I know.

150
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
My mom has also urged me.

151
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,800
What?

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Is anyone in the homestay?

153
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Dad.

154
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
Dad.

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
You must be the boss, Song Qi Yue.

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Hello, uncle. It's me.

157
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Don't call me uncle.

158
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Let me introduce myself.

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm the president of Gu Group, Gu Buli.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
May I ask

161
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,000
when can our group start working?

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
Start working?

163
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you mean?

164
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I'm so worried.

165
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,600
There's a truck and a construction team at the door.

166
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
What are you doing?

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,600
Dad, I hope you won't make things difficult for us anymore.

168
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
You're making things difficult for me.

169
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,000
I regret letting you come here.

170
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,200
I came here because I wanted to see the project first.

171
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,400
You said you could take over the company.

172
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
That's why I let you come here.

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,200
What have you done all this time?

174
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
You haven't improved at all.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
You even took over the company.

176
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,600
What do you think you're doing as a vice president?

177
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Vice president?

178
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
Vice president of Gu Group?

179
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,600
Gu Chuan?

180
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Is what he said true?

181
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
Qi Yue.

182
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,000
I was going to tell you this.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
But I swear I never betrayed the homestay.

184
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,800
Let me ask you.

185
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,200
You're his son, aren't you?

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Yes.

187
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,000
You sent the company to take back our homestay, right?

188
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
But I changed my mind later.

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm asking you, aren't you?

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
From the beginning, yes.

191
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Hello. Do you need help?

192
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Why are you helping me today?

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
It's a help.

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,800
It's such a big homestay. How can two girls do it?

195
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,400
Do you have something to hide from Qi Yue?

196
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,800
What can I hide from him?

197
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,600
So you've been lying to me from the beginning, right?

198
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
I...

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,200
No wonder you're so familiar with this homestay.

200
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,000
I thought you were different from them.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,400
You really like this. You really want to support me.

202
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,200
But what happened? I was always kept in the dark.

203
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Qi Yue, I didn't mean it like that.

204
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,400
You're the worst! I hate it when people lie to me!

205
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
This is the second time I've been lied to in this homestay.

206
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I thought you were sent by Heaven to save me.

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
But you've been lying to me.

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,400
Do you know that? You're making me laugh.

209
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
Qi Yue, I really want to help you from the beginning to now.

210
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Enough!

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
I won't believe you again.

212
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,200
From today on, I hope you can stay away from me.

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,400
The farther, the better, Vice President.

214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
I'll love you.

215
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,000
We're not magicians!

216
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,160
Invading the Carpenter,

217
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,880
you can produce all kinds of napalm.

218
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Constraints gain therapy.

219
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
Many things, they become a misunderstanding.

220
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,240
Yes, it's a misunderstanding.

221
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
I almost ruined myself

222
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
and mistook someone else.

223
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,440
What if it's because

224
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,040
there's a hard-to-speak side?

225
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
Then it shouldn't have happened at the beginning.

226
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
The purpose is wrong.

227
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,360
Everything after that is wrong.

228
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,480
The purpose at the beginning...

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,760
Yes.

230
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,480
What is it?

231
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,640
The intersection of four seasons

232
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:14,280
can't be explained in words.

233
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,920
Even if it's far away from the mountain,

234
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,520
I still have to chase after your path.

235
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Just like the wind and the rain.

236
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Even if it's far away from the mountain,

237
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I still have to chase after your path.

238
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Just like the wind and the rain.
