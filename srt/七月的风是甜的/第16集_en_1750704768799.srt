The Long Ballad

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Qi Yue, why did you leave so suddenly?

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We can discuss about the renovation.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We can just take the 230,000 yuan we have.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The money is here.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It makes me feel sick.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You said it was your hard work.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now you feel sick?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where are the books?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Zhu Gu Li, why are you being so arrogant?

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Aren't you from the Gu family?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't know.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I also think that they did something wrong.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I quarreled with Mr. Gu.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He is fine now.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He doesn't care about me.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You are so kind.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Boss Song, do you still want the books for the hotel management?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I may not need them.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll leave them to you.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You keep them for now.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Maybe you can use them later.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's take the 2.3 million yuan first.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We can get more money later.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We can't take advantage of Gu.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want to see him anymore.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Fine.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You don't go, I'll go.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll take care of you if you don't care.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll go to that Gu San again.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I...

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Chengdu may take Song Qi Yue to the 2.3 million yuan.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You prepare for it.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Chengdu may take Song Qi Yue to the 2.3 million yuan.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You prepare for it.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Gu San, I'll bring you some words for Qi Yue.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Today, I've re-evaluated the budget

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
from the professional agency.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a bit different from the last calculation.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I knew it.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I should have known it.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You did it on purpose when you wrote the contract last time.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It should be 3.2 million yuan.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
3...

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Chengdu, please help me to transfer Song Qi Yue.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No matter what decision she makes,

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll stick to her.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll try my best to get the biggest benefit for her.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Fine.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Didn't you say that she has two more words to say to me?

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's the other one?

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The other one is that Song Qi Yue said

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
she won't forgive you in this life.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She'll forgive you a thousand times.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You wait and see.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Duo Duo, are you having meal?

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll get you some milk tea.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're free.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Qi Yue will leave soon.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Chengdu will leave with her.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
I'll take you away.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
Look at you.

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm just worried. It's useless.

67
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,800
You need someone to help you.

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,040
I think you should

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
talk to Song Qi Yue in person

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,640
to solve the misunderstanding.

71
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,680
He was so angry yesterday.

72
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,320
I'm afraid he won't give me a chance to talk.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Impossible.

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
As long as you try to get back,

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,280
he'll feel it.

76
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,160
The point is, I can't even enter the door now.

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,840
Then enter the door first.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,840
I'll go.

79
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Qi Yue, I...

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
Duo Duo, is the milk tea good?

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
I'll order you a spicy and sour noodle.

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,200
I don't know if you really like it or not.

83
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,240
But my nose really hurts.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
I feel sorry for you.

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
Now,

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
we can only use the big trick.

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
What big trick?

88
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,800
Hit him with a stick.

89
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,840
Can it work?

90
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,640
How to operate it?

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
Just use your face.

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
Duo Duo,

93
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,080
do you want the spicy and sour noodle to be slightly spicy or medium spicy?

94
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,040
Hit him with a stick.

95
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,920
Song Qi Yue.

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
Song Qi Yue.

97
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,440
Qi Yue, if you don't forgive me,

98
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
I'll...

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,560
No.

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,760
It doesn't work.

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,360
I'll think of another way.

102
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,720
Actually, in these days when we're together,

103
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
you know very well

104
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,880
what kind of person Gu Ci Han is.

105
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,160
Don't you really

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,760
listen to him at all?

107
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,160
I know.

108
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,280
But what I want is

109
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,960
someone who can walk forward together,

110
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,800
and walk towards the future together.

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
If he can't do these,

112
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
I might as well walk by myself.

113
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Gu Ci Han is so cruel.

114
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,240
There are 8 billion people on the earth,

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,640
but I met you.

116
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,800
Oh my god.

117
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
You really love him?

118
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,600
Whether you like it or not,

119
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,400
we've met each other.

120
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
This is fate.

121
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
Since you can't change your fate,

122
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,840
let him come.

123
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
At this moment,

124
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,960
I just want to tell you...

125
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,640
I'm warning you.

126
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Stay away from me.

127
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,880
Qi Yue,

128
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,480
why don't you think about it again?

129
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,880
What else can I think about?

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,440
The express is on its way.

131
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,320
But please be considerate.

132
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,520
I don't care about how you feel,

133
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,040
I just want to give advice.

134
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,880
Ms. Gu.

135
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,200
Our complement pay delivery is here.

136
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,320
Are you one of them?

137
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
in such a small way?

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Please,

139
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,040
can you stop worrying about that?

140
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Six months ago,

141
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
My girlfriend and I went to Wuxi for a trip.

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,680
In this little house,

143
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,880
we spent the best time of our lives.

144
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
We even agreed to get married here.

145
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,880
But now,

146
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
my girlfriend is no longer alive.

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,280
So I ask you to help me

148
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
give her the most unforgettable wedding.

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,100
A Marie lily

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Hello?

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I promise you

152
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
I will let you guys

153
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
have an unforgettable wedding here

154
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
A couple is going around

155
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Finally back to their promised

156
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
wedding

157
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
So romantic

158
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Do you believe in love at first sight or

159
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
I believe in beauty

160
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
and character

161
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Character is hard to judge

162
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
After all, everyone has different sides

163
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Then it depends on the appearance and the material

164
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
I can't help it

165
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
For example, some people are very talented

166
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
But there are some mistakes in the relationship

167
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Then it depends on my mood

168
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Sure enough, this is a woman

169
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,480
The sky is full of fragrance

170
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Time is so fast

171
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
But remember the painful love

172
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
No traces left

173
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Waiting for you under the peach tree

174
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
The wind in the moon is the sky

175
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
The bridge is the bridge of four seasons

176
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,480
No word can explain

177
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Even if it's a mountain and a moon

178
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,480
I have to chase after your path

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Like the wind and the rain

180
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Even if it's a mountain and a moon

181
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,480
I have to chase after your path

182
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Like the wind and the rain
