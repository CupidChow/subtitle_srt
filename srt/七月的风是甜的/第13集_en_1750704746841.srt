2
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,700
chuckles

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,500
Take a week

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,100
Sell ​​this homestay to me

5
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,300
Aunt,you need to be curious

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,100
We are serious about starting a homestay this time

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,600
Look,our business is really fast

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a pity to give it up now

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,700
Are you and uncle happy doing it these days?

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,700
That's pretty satisfying

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,100
Especially Gu

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
Service is passion.

13
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,100
Actually, it's just so-so.

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,100
What? I'll hurt him?

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,100
He has such a high education and a lot of good jobs.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
He has to come here and work hard.

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,100
Auntie, you don't understand.

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Now, young people like to start their own business and be bosses.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
You're also a boss?

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Young man, let me tell you.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,100
You don't understand.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,100
When you grow up, you'll know when to do what.

23
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,100
What's the business of this young girl's family?

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,100
It's a few years of delay.

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
You can't find a boyfriend.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Who said I can't find one?

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,100
Where is he?

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,100
You...

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Where is he? You find him for me.

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,100
Hello, auntie.

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
I'm her boyfriend.

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
Who are you?

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,100
Uncle, auntie, I'm Sun Peng.

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
I'm a classmate who studied abroad with Qi Yue.

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,100
I liked her when I was in school.

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,100
I came back with her this time just to be with her.

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
I'll be with her in Wuxi.

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Please rest assured.

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
Yes, that's right.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Yes, that's right.

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,100
He's my boyfriend.

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Xiaochun, I have a few questions to talk to you.

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
Uncle, please say it.

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,100
If your mother and our Qi Yue fell into the water at the same time, who would you save?

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
Who would you save?

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
She.

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,100
My mother was a diving athlete when she was young.

48
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,100
She could save everyone in your family's classroom.

49
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
You hit the father's question.

50
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Who will you go back to when the festival is over?

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
Where is she?

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Where is the home?

53
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
What if you two quarrel?

54
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Uncle, I'm really not experienced in this.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Because Qi Yue and I never quarreled.

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,100
If we really quarrel in the future, we have to talk about it.

57
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
It's unbreakable.

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Four to two.

60
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Two to me.

61
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
I can't remember it all.

62
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,100
Sun Meng, why don't you go back and rest earlier?

63
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
It's only half past eight.

64
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
It's only half past eight.

65
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
That's right.

66
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,100
You have to go to work tomorrow.

67
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Go back and rest early.

68
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Dad, you're right.

69
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,100
That...

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
The company said I don't have to work tomorrow.

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
That's right.

72
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
Why go back so early?

73
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Dad, you don't know.

74
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
She lives far away.

75
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
It takes three and a half hours to drive back.

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Then you let her live here.

77
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
There are so many rooms here anyway.

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
I suddenly remembered that there is no room.

79
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
In the afternoon, a tour group booked the room.

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
They will come in the middle of the night.

81
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Song Qi Yue, I think you're going too far.

82
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
I always feel that you're pushing Sun Peng out.

83
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Do I have a boyfriend?

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
I don't have a boyfriend.

85
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
You give me an honest explanation.

86
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Are you two boyfriends or not?

87
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Go.

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,100
Go back to sleep with me.

89
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
They're playing.

90
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
Why are you all leaving?

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
We continue.

92
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
Do you remember all these I just listed?

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Then you recite it.

94
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Your favorite color is green.

95
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I hate summer and love hot pot.

96
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
I had two boyfriends before.

97
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,100
The most romantic thing we did was to go back to school on a rainy day.

98
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,100
In Shangri-La, I said to you that I had to marry you.

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
I bought a house in Wuxi for you.

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
I bought a house in Wuxi?

101
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Did I write it?

102
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
No.

103
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
But I really bought a house in Wuxi.

104
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
You just came to Wuxi for a week.

105
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
You bought a house?

106
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Because I want to settle down in Wuxi.

107
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
No.

108
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
By the way,

109
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I may have to bother you to play with me one more day tomorrow.

110
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
My parents are very determined to get me back this time.

111
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,100
We both played to this extent.

112
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Just help people to the end.

113
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
I definitely can't go back with them.

114
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
Don't worry.

115
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Don't worry.

116
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,100
I don't want you to go back either.

117
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
One six.

118
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
One six.

119
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Two ten.

120
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
You... you use two ten to roll a six.

121
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Can you play with your heart?

122
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Yes.

123
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Your heart is in the room.

124
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I'm just worried about her safety.

125
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Okay.

126
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Chengdu.

127
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Yes.

128
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
How about you help me to send them a fruit on the street?

129
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
By the way,

130
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
what are they doing?

131
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
I've sent it eight times.

132
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,100
What can they do?

133
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Don't worry.

134
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Come on.

135
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
I can close the door.

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Oh, no.

137
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
The curtain is pulled.

138
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Oh, no.

139
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
I suddenly remembered.

140
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
I pulled the charger and sent it to the room.

141
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
I have to go there.

142
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
You...

143
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
You...

144
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
You're worried about her.

145
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
You...

146
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
She wants to run around.

147
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
What are you doing?

148
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
I'm playing.

149
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
You're a brat.

150
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Chengdu

151
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
What?

152
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
The engagement?

153
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Yes.

154
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Otherwise, how long will it take?

155
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
I think Sun Peng is a stable child.

156
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
Sun,

157
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
invite your parents.

158
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
We'll meet

159
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,100
and make your life a better one.

160
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Qi Yue,

161
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
maybe you don't know

162
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
that I've been preparing this ring for a long time.

163
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
I don't know when

164
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
I've already crossed the line of friends

165
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
for your feelings.

166
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,100
The King of Dwarves

167
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
A lot of things are always in the wrong.

168
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
But only by making a mistake

169
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
do you know what you want.

170
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah.

171
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Sometimes the hole is getting bigger.

172
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
You must be quick to stop it.

173
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Why are you so anxious?

174
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
I didn't say what it is.

175
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Absolutely not a good thing.

176
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,100
The fire of July

177
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,100
The sky is full of fragrance

178
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Time is silent

179
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
But it's so long

180
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
No trace

181
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Waiting for you under the peach tree

182
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,100
The wind of July is sweet

183
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,100
The bridge on the shoulder is four seasons

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:16,100
There is no word to describe

185
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Even if it's a mountain and a moon

186
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I have to chase after your path

187
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Just like the wind and the rain

188
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,100
