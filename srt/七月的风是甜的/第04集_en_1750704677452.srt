00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's here.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Why isn't there a sign?

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is this normal?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who are you?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We are from Su Nan University's wedding club.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A week ago, on that platform,

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we booked a room for the doctor in your house.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How much guts did Deng Zhe leave me?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The homestay has just been moved.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We can't accept guests.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You didn't inform us in advance.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We worked for hours to find the food.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We can refund.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is a credit problem.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to complain to you.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Don't say it.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
ID card.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This homestay is not bad.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There's a pool.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A pool?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's so big.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you following us?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There's no one on the front desk.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're too impulsive.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's too rough to open today.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Four or five rooms.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We don't have enough people.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's okay.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I found a temporary cleaner online.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He'll come later.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Clean up the inside.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You go back first.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll arrange it.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ten minutes.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Boss, why didn't you change my bed sheet?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid I have to breathe when I'm in the bathroom.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who's in the bathroom?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's disgusting.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Twenty minutes.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Seven.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Seven.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a man.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Did I find the wrong place?

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're here at the right time.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are...

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It doesn't matter who I am.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll help you change your clothes.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here, put it on.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
By the way,

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
which room will I go to later?

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Which room will I go to later?

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go to the room on the second floor first.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Someone will pick you up there.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Cleaning supplies.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No need.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You brought them yourself.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've prepared everything for you.

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why are they all Xiao Guye and Jie Celin?

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Duo Duo.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sister.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're finally here.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why are you wearing this treasured dress?

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I thought it was the treasured dress you taught me.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is my best friend, Cheng Duo.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hello, is this Jia Zheng's company?

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't need to come to the cleaning service this afternoon.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've been working hard for the past two days.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But you don't have to come either.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now this homestay doesn't need you to worry about it.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What do you mean?

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll try to earn one million yuan in the next two months.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll pay you back quickly.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't worry.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
As long as I make a profit,

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll definitely give you a bonus.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Duo Duo.

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The 100,000 yuan I owe you

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
may not be able to pay off in time.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's okay.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Just take it as

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've given you this homestay.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm also willing to be the owner of this homestay.

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Such a big homestay.

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can you two girls do it?

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Our Duo Duo

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
is a professional hotel manager.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't worry, she's here.

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's so hot.

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't take it off first.

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think you're especially suitable to wear this dress.

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Come on, go upstairs with me.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're the owner and you're going to clean the room?

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't brush the toilet first.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've already brushed the toilet.

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The air conditioner in the living room has never been turned off.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I've brushed the toilet.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Duo Duo.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's wrong with the air conditioner?

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The air conditioner is not broken.

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Or the air conditioner is out of power?

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's been out of power for a long time.

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm so worried.

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't worry.

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Go online and find a master who can repair the air conditioner.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And go back to the toilet.

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hurry up.

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, I'll go first.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Boss, this room is not good for me.

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You have to solve it quickly.

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll solve it.

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Boss, I don't even have a pair of slippers.

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hurry up and get me a pair of slippers.

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll get it.

125
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't have slippers here.

126
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What can I do in this house?

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who's looking for you?

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Who's looking for you?

129
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't worry, don't worry.

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can solve it.

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can solve it.

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hello, Duo Duo.

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tell the master who can repair the air conditioner

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to bring another pair of slippers and a pair of toothpicks.

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hurry up.

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Bye.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When can these guys stop?

138
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
When can they sleep?

139
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Duo Duo, what's wrong with you?

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
These guys are taking this place as a bar.

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They turn on the lights and turn off the lights.

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There are several light bulbs now.

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I just climbed the ladder to change the light bulb.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I fell down by accident.

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Are you okay?

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Qiyue, I think

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
our homestay really needs a man.

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Where's Song Qiyue?

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're here.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Qiyue went to rest.

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We stayed up two whole nights.

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Now we sleep in the morning.

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Those college students

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
are so annoying.

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They sleep at six in the morning.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Six in the morning?

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What time do they go out to play in the day?

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They haven't been out since they came.

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They sleep in the morning.

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They have a party in the room at night.

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Not only they don't sleep,

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
they don't let me sleep.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They want this and that.

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They see us tired.

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're so annoying.

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can't believe you did this.

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You did this to us last night.

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You did this to us last night.

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You did this to us last night.

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is not a good thing.

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They have to stay here for several days.

172
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You have to find a way to drive them out.

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Go out and play?

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They go out in the day and dry their energy.

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They don't want to bother us at night.

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We can sleep well.

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I know

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
there is an iron man three-way tour.

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We go to more than ten scenic spots a day.

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I want to get a 70% discount.

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are you a guide?

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He is my assistant and driver.

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How about this?

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You take this tour route and type in the whole name.

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to sleep.

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What's wrong?

188
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now the students are

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in a bad mood.

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Ordinary tourist spots can't attract them.

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We have to find a different place

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to attract them.

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Different place?

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Daybreak in Anyang Mountain?

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How far is Anyang Mountain?

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It should be around here.

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you really going there?

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's so interesting about the sunrise?

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The point is not the sunrise.

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Look here.

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The new notebook is waiting for you.

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't walk anymore.

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Go.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you want the notebook?

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Go.

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't walk.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Go.

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If I knew it was such a notebook,

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I wouldn't go even if I died.

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, you have to delete it.

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I can't go.

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can't go.

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes, I climbed the mountain all night.

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm so sleepy.

215
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can't believe it.

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They went back to sleep.

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Can they stop

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
for a while today?

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Duoduo, you're so bad.

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The point is they sleep during the day.

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What if they keep torturing us?

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What should we do?

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's okay.

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've prepared a night light mountain.

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They've been there once.

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They won't believe it again.

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll take an electric car.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Where can you get an electric car?

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There are mountains in Yangshan

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and the Taoyuan Mountains in Wanmu.

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The ancient fork of Qianming

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and the resonance between the two worlds.

233
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's so romantic.

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
With the most passionate heart,

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you can make the sweetest honey.

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's the same for everyone.

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why do you suddenly value it?

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it's the end.

240
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I miss you.

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Time is so silent.

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But it's so long.

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It leaves no trace.

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm waiting for you under the peach tree.

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The wind is so strong.

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The four seasons are so long.

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can only say you.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Even if it's a mountain,

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll chase after your footsteps.

250
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Like the wind following the rain.

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Even if it's a mountain,

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll chase after your footsteps.

253
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like the wind following the rain.
