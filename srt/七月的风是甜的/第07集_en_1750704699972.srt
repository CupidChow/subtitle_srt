00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To be continued...

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
When will we finish this?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The famous snacks in the Peach Blossom House.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Each one has its own flavor.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There are at least 300 stores in the whole Wuqi.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Finish what you have.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One more.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The Peach Blossom House is delicious.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The point is, I don't know which one you want to eat.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The flavor you ate when you were a kid.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Stop talking.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Or you won't be able to eat it after the air is polluted.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Luckily, I have only two left.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Finish these two.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We will win.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hello, brother.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why don't you call Brother Xue?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Where are you?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm in the dorm.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why is the window crooked?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What do you know? I'm watching the beauty.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Stop talking. Do me a favor.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm busy. I'm not free.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Three sets of acupressure skin.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's the matter?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Brother, I can't talk.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Go to my room now.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There is an iron box in the second drawer under the bookcase.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There is an old picture of me eating peach blossom.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Take a picture and send it to me.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hurry up.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Here is the picture.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's easy to do with pictures.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But at present, there is no store that uses this old package.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can ask the old people in Wuxi.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They must have seen this package bag.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The bag is on me.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Grandma, do you know this package?

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is my daughter.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I said this package.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you know the package?

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Your name is package?

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's so ugly.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not package.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Song Qiyuan, tell her I'm package.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can't understand.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Be patient with the old people.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Grandma, didn't you say this is your daughter?

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The peach blossom in your daughter's hand.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you know which store is the package from?

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Who is your daughter?

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How old am I?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Girl, why did you turn into a picture?

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Come out.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come out.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Come out.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why did you turn into a picture?

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Come out.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come out.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Uncle, I want to ask you something.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Have you seen the package in the picture?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Uncle, I want to ask you something.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Uncle.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want to get married.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why did he ask me to get married?

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He said you are a middle-class man.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Uncle, this package bag.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Do you know the package bag?

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:43,120
A

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There are many clues.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Duoduo, why are you so smart?

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What should I do without you?

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't be too happy too early.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There are so many news on the Internet now.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Look at the lively, blind and talkative.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Nothing to help.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If this is a check,

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's hard to make progress in a short time.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I found it.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Look at this person.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He has a nose and a tooth.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He is an intellectual at first glance.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He didn't run away.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let me see.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Isn't this the one who lied to me before?

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He told me that the three generations of their family were doing hair and makeup.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I went over and saw the bun shop.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How much did you get cheated?

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One month's salary.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, I was just anxious to get on my head.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The clue is broken again.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's really making people unhappy.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, I have to try again according to the smell in my memory.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It doesn't look good.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can improve it.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Try the taste first.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Song Qiyue, you blew up the kitchen.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't worry about these first.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hurry up and try it.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm back.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How is it?

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is the O-bass in my memory?

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I just went abroad.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hurry up and try it.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Is it okay?

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It stinks.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Eat human food.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Give me a smell.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Where is the fake tooth?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Where is the fake tooth?

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Qiyue, the winner buys ice and tries.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I didn't let you try.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Whoever eats will vomit.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stop talking.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Have you found the fake tooth?

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
As long as it's Wu Xi's, I'll find it.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Look at this number.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He said this package was from the old shop.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He even gave out the address.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it real?

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't care if it's real or not.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I want to try it.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What if it's real?

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Try this.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is really the package from your shop.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's more.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The shop is gone.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Gone?

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have a formula that I can give you.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But I have a requirement.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You little cat.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hungry?

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Here, eat.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can't eat every day?

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm so full.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I want to eat the peach blossom cake made by mom.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to eat it every day.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I want to eat it forever.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But mom can't be with you forever.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't cry.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nan Nan, if you can't find mom,

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
just eat a piece of peach blossom cake.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then you can miss mom.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What a pity.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't have the talent to go to the kitchen.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Since mom left,

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I haven't tasted the taste of food.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Can you tell me the original address of the shop?

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
When was the shop closed?

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Or provide some other information?

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What's wrong with you?

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They told you the story in their hearts.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You still don't believe them?

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I just need to confirm it.

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You really don't understand the father.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Boss is like that.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I can understand.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What you hold in your hand is the photo of the shop at that time.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's been closed for more than ten years.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The location is at the end of Yangshan Street.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It wasn't planned so well at that time.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's just a very small door.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You just said you have a request.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
In the book, in front of the sky,

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
a brick and a tile are telling the story of culture.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
A place that fits the temperament of Wu Xi.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It values culture and heritage.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I always feel that it hides some great masters.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
For example, the legend of the legend of the peach blossom tree.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I leave it to you.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Food and food.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How do you know?

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You have this temperament.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm here.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm here.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm here.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm here.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm here.

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm here.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm here.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm here.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
