To be continued...

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Si An, your father and I thought you were exaggerating.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But now that I see you, this shop is really not easy to handle.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I sent a familiar person here for a long time.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He caused me to be so careless and offended Song Qi Yue.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's really hard for you.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Once you come up here, you'll meet such an ungrateful person.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's okay. I'll just take it as a lesson.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go back and tell my father that maybe he's going to be a pain in the ass this time.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But I won't give up easily.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Just let him not worry and wait for the good news.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No need.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Who is your Uncle Zhang?

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What kind of big trouble have I never seen before?

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No matter how fierce he is, he's just a yellow-haired girl.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's see how Uncle Zhang will deal with you.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You misunderstood.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's okay. I can handle it myself.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Si An, since Uncle Zhang ate your meal today,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
he can't eat this meal for free.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The rest, watch me.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Uncle Zhang, that's not what I meant.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I didn't notice yesterday and accidentally hit you.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, we didn't mean to.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Please don't be angry.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hitting me is a big and small thing.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It depends on Boss Song's sincerity.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If Boss Song's sincerity is in place,

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll take it as if this thing has never happened.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What sincerity?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What sincerity?

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I told you.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This Uncle Zhang is a detective.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's here to share more about our homestay.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Am I right?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Which one of us is he?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is the plan of our group to take over other hotels.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I understand.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, that's right.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Gu Si An, won't you explain?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I wanted to explain yesterday.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A detective had to come.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think our homestay is not ready yet.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In order to cause unnecessary trouble,

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I booked the whole house.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I have a few questions to ask you.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why did you choose to open a homestay here?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What's the difference between this homestay and other scenic spots?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What is the benefit of your decoration?

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What do you want to express?

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I was...

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I was...

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was...

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is the amount of accommodation in your hotel?

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The staff is well-behaved.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If the hotel guests are in,

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
can you ensure that every guest has the best accommodation experience?

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, there's more.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There's more.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Have you ever had long-term meetings?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
For example, for three years or five years,

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
is there anything that makes people look forward to in the future?

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sir, can you give us a chance to talk?

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is this your hotel staff?

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You are the shopkeeper, I am the guest.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You touch my words, I'm the guest.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You touch my words, and you ask me.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Have you never done any training before?

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What attitude is this?

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, no.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Move, move, move.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, you can answer my questions.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You all remember.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You must do as I said.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Call me when you're done.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm done.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm done.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Qiyue, don't be too depressed.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do your best.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm done.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm done.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm done.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm done.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm done.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm done.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm done.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm done.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm done.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm done.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm done.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The key is that he said that.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Our hotel is really useless.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not good for us.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I told the blogger.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let him not to promote our hotel.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
When we make improvements, we will bring him back.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I forgive you for yesterday.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then you're not angry with me?

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Of course not.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I thought about it.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Although the blogger didn't listen to me,

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
but it makes sense.

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Our hotel lacks features.

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If it goes on like this, there will be no competition.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We have to make some changes.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I agree.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What do you want to do?

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There is no specific direction yet.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But we can go to another house to see.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's always right to borrow other people's success experience.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's a good direction.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I checked it.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The first stop is the local luxury hotel.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Gu Banjun.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I disagree.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Gu Banjun.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Gu Banjun.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Gu Banjun.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Gu Banjun.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Gu Banjun.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Gu Banjun.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Gu Banjun.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Gu Banjun.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Gu Banjun.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Gu Banjun.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Gu Banjun.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Gu Banjun.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Gu Banjun.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Gu Banjun.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Gu Banjun.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Gu Banjun.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Gu Banjun.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Gu Banjun.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Gu Banjun.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Gu Banjun.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Gu Banjun.

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Gu Banjun.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Gu Banjun.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Gu Banjun.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Gu Banjun.

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Gu Banjun.

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Gu Banjun.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Gu Banjun.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Gu Banjun.

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's a five-star hotel.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It looks very cultural.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why are you so sneaky?

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Keep your voice down.

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We're competing in the same industry.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's better to be secretive.

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go.

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You must give me the report today.

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I understand.

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've said it many times.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Zhao.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Why does that guy look so familiar?

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It seems to be Gu.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No way.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He does look familiar.

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why are there two girls around him?

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Could it be...

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Stop talking.

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Wait.

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mr. Gu.

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't guess too much.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I knew it was you.

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You should say hello.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Go play.

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's my friend.

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He doesn't know this hotel is ours.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He doesn't know my family background.

176
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I understand.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's your expression?

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll let him know.

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's nothing.

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm here.

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I've checked the facilities here.

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think it's good.

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why did you take so long?

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There are many people in the toilet.

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I got the right order.

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Look.

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We've summarized a lot of the information.

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's take a look.

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay.

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hello.

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is afternoon tea from our hotel.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
For you.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's this.

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Ma Jia's velvet cake.

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Remember it.

196
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll take a picture.

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Handwritten macarons.

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Handwritten macarons.

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Heart-pounding lightning puff.

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Heart-pounding lightning puff.

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Heart-pounding baby goose liver bread.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There's goose liver.

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There's a goose liver.

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And this is the specialty of our hotel.

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Love is always high.

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is a good meaning.

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This looks delicious.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's all about love.

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
These days,

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I've really opened my eyes.

211
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've summarized a few categories.

212
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Decoration, performance, service, and food.

213
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's your favorite?

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The one that impressed me the most

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is Gu Ban's house.

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Their decoration and service are all very good.

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And that afternoon tea set.

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It really caught my eye.

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Gu Can, what do you think?

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think it's average.

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The name is too rough.

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The name is a bit...

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But the profit is good.

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And their food is good.

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The food is good.

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The food is good.

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The food is good.

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But the profit is good.

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And their food is good.

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I've thought about it.

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The other directions are more invested in the transformation.

232
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Only within a short time,

233
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
it's easier to realize.

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And it won't cause us

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
too much economic burden.

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Amazing.

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I used to eat a kind of peach blossom crisp when I was a kid.

238
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's different from other places.

239
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
My mom's friend sent it.

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's the traditional way of Wuxi.

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Peach blossom crisp?

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's not easy to make.

243
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's time for you to know my skillful cooking skills.

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Please call me the food-reducing chicken.

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You can do it?

246
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Gu Can, you're from Wuxi.

247
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're the food-reducing chicken master.

248
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You really know how to cook?

249
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Who do you look down on?

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm the noodles or the water?

251
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Forget it.

252
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The food-reducing chicken master

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
From today,

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
the restaurant will introduce all kinds of special food and drinks.

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This royal wine is the first one.

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The river is under the old and the river is under the old.

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The river is under the old.

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If you want to eat delicious food,

259
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll vote for peach blossom crisp.

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's the taste of Wuxi.

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I want to treat you as a best friend.

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We want to go together.

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Peach blossom crisp

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's full of peach blossom.

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Life will be full of joy.

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're so good at talking.

267
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Come and watch the homestay with me.

268
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
In reality, it's actually a common mouth.

269
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Who are you lying to?

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Time is so quiet.

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But remember the painful love.

272
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No trace left.

273
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Waiting for you under the tree.

274
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The wind is sweet in the moon.

275
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The four seasons of the sword are interspersed.

276
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No word can describe you.

277
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Even in the mountains and mountains,

278
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I will follow your footsteps.

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like the wind following the rain.

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Even in the mountains and mountains,

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I will follow your footsteps.

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Like the wind following the rain.
