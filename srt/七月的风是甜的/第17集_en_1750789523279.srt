The Long Ballad

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 18

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, this is it.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I remember that day, we had dinner on the bed.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He even put Huishan Nian in the bed.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Does anyone live in this room now?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's my room now.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But it doesn't matter. I'm leaving.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Duo Duo, let's clean up.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Whose daughter-in-law is this?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's Gu Zi'an's.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't get me wrong.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is the first night I saw him.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He lent it to me.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You should have a good sleep.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't think about anything.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Maybe when you wake up tomorrow,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
things will change.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're right.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You won't sleep here, right?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's so nice here.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's so beautiful.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll make a good dream tonight.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to meet you in the past.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The time is...

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Throw it away.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I...

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You need to learn to break up.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You need to leave the past behind.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then you can change your life.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I want to see you in the future.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why is our meeting

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
all about you?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Gu is so sad.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
During the payment period,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you...

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's the reason this time?

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it a way to help?

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
To be accurate,

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
it should be a way to send coal.

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,360
People don't send them for free

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:49,700
Wait for your fancy

46
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,740
The peach Annual Why is it delicious

47
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,020
It's the taste you ate when you were little.

48
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,940
Congratulations. It's the taste you ate when you were little.

49
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,140
I've arranged everything for you.

50
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,380
When the time comes, the groom will hold the bride and get off the car.

51
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,100
Then we'll wear this, the new-shaped bow.

52
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,620
We've already sprinkled a lot of beautiful rose petals on the roadside.

53
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,260
Wait a minute.

54
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,660
Actually, our idea is to just simplify everything.

55
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,920
Yes. After all, we've been in the business of

56
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,260
doing business for a long time.

57
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,500
But we've already been in the business of doing business for a long time.

58
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,820
We're not doing business for a long time.

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,540
After all, we've been in the business of taking care of patients all year round.

60
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,940
We've spent a lot of money.

61
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,500
Actually, everything that can be simplified is already simplified.

62
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,780
The rest of the things...

63
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,180
But I think we just need a simple ceremony.

64
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,820
Then we can invite some relatives and friends to witness our wedding.

65
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,700
I don't agree.

66
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,060
There's only one wedding in our life. How can we just do it casually?

67
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,260
Even though we won't waste money, we have to be decent.

68
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,340
The things that should be there, the things that should be equipped,

69
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,940
the people that should be invited, we can't spare any of them.

70
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,340
Then, the cost will increase.

71
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,300
We have to do all of these things at the wedding ceremony.

72
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,460
You two don't have to worry about the cost.

73
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,540
We will help you share the burden.

74
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,100
Duoduo, this is my bank card.

75
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,060
The things that should be equipped, you can use it in my card.

76
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,140
How much money do you have in your card?

77
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,820
Over 5,000 yuan.

78
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,380
That's not enough.

79
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,180
Then how much do you have?

80
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,620
I'll lend you all my money.

81
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,620
Why don't you lend me some first?

82
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,100
I... I don't have any money.

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,340
Why don't you have any money? What about your salary?

84
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,540
Salary? I don't even have a job.

85
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,540
To be precise, I've been fired.

86
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,660
But it's okay. Although I don't have any money,

87
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,620
I have a way.

88
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,980
Qi Yue.

89
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,940
Take the things back. I don't want to owe you anything.

90
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,460
Don't forget. I'm the shareholder here and I'm also an employee here.

91
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,100
The matter of the homestay is my business.

92
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,940
Qi Yue.

93
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,140
Don't be angry, Mr. Gu.

94
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,880
This needs to be treated. I'll help you to learn how to use the

95
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
deep-sand.

96
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,380
It hurts.

97
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,380
Come here.

98
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,380
It hurts.

99
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,180
Get over there.

100
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,260
My ears are really peeled.

101
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,980
Zhu Guoli, don't think that I don't know that you've been in the dark for a whole day.

102
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,180
You have a good eye.

103
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm giving you a chance to make up for it.

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,140
How much money did you spend on this?

105
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,180
You can write down every single amount of money.

106
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,860
I'll return it to you after the wedding.

107
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,940
I don't want to owe any money to their Gu family.

108
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,460
Actually, you don't know that

109
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,620
Mr. Gu himself spent all this money.

110
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,340
He and I have nothing to do with the Gu family anymore.

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,380
What do you mean?

112
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,980
Today morning, the board meeting,

113
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,420
Mr. Gu and his father

114
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,540
had a fight because of the homestay.

115
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,820
They announced that they would withdraw from the board meeting in front of the whole company.

116
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,620
Who are you lying to? I can't do it.

117
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,220
Look at you. We don't trust each other at all.

118
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,020
I...

119
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,020
Look.

120
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,740
Mrs. Gu called me to find Mr. Gu.

121
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,420
Do you think I'll take it or not?

122
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,820
I'll listen to you.

123
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
My hand is so strong.

124
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,740
It's like a coin.

125
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's welcome the two newbies.

126
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,860
Please come on the stage.

127
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,600
Hurry up.

128
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,460
Okay. I declare that

129
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,340
Zhao Zi Hang, the groom,

130
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,020
Feng Qi Qi, the bride,

131
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,620
the wedding shall now commence!

132
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,140
Let's sing!

133
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,220
Heaven and Earth.

134
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,740
Second bow.

135
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Gao Tang...

136
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,020
Gao Tang didn't come. Who should we bow to?

137
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
How about dancing?

138
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
That won't do.

139
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,580
How about letting Mr. Gu come?

140
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,780
He's the leader after all.

141
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,980
He's not suitable.

142
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Let me do it.

143
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,780
I'm sorry about the board meeting.

144
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,140
Let's not talk about it today.

145
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,940
I'm here to attend the wedding.

146
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,420
Let's calm down.

147
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,140
Next, let's welcome

148
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,740
the chairman and wife of Gu Group.

149
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,540
Let's give them a round of applause.

150
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Let's go.

151
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Please.

152
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Thank you, everyone.

153
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,980
We're all family here today.

154
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,540
There's no Mrs. Gu.

155
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,740
But I still want to thank you.

156
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,740
But I still want to say something.

157
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,340
It's my honor to attend

158
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,140
the wedding of these two new people.

159
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,540
Their faithful love

160
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,940
makes me very touched.

161
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,740
I'm thinking,

162
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,340
what's the most important thing

163
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,340
in this world?

164
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,940
Is it money, happiness, or dreams?

165
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
I think everyone here

166
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,540
has their own answers.

167
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,740
But I think

168
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,140
all of these

169
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,740
are not worth mentioning

170
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,140
in front of life.

171
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,940
Now,

172
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,140
we have conflicts

173
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,340
because of money and interests.

174
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Or because of feelings.

175
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,340
These things seem to be

176
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
meaningless in the next decades.

177
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
I'm sorry

178
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,540
to take advantage of the wedding time.

179
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,940
I want to announce two things.

180
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,740
First,

181
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,740
I've contacted

182
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,180
the best

183
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,740
general-purpose experts in the country.

184
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,740
Someone will pick you up tomorrow.

185
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Second,

186
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,740
whether Song Qi Yue

187
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
decides to stay in the Qimeng Bureau,

188
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,140
I will continue to open the B&B.

189
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,140
I will keep opening it.

190
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,340
Let me draw a wind

191
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,340
to soothe your ears

192
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,940
and cover your face.

193
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,140
Let me draw a cloud

194
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,140
to cover the sky

195
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,540
when the night falls.

196
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,940
Let me hear the old promise

197
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,940
to open the door of the life.

198
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,340
The dream of Qi Yue

199
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,740
is like a wish

200
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,940
to be with you.

201
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,740
This pair of Chinese first-class partners

202
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,940
witnessed a couple's love.

203
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,140
You have someone you like?

204
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,740
We've known each other for so many years.

205
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,940
You don't want to tell me your feelings, do you?

206
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,140
We haven't met before.

207
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,540
Are you an uncle

208
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,940
or a student?

209
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,940
Or

210
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,740
you are a sister of Fan Chuan.

211
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,140
Maybe when we meet,

212
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,740
you will be more surprised.

213
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
I'm looking forward to it.

214
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,140
Will there be such a day?

215
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Wait for me.

216
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,140
The wind blows in the sky.

217
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,140
The sword is cut off.

218
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,140
The four seasons are over.

219
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,140
There is no word

220
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,140
to explain.

221
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Even if it's a mountain,

222
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,140
I will wait for you.

223
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,140
The wind blows in the sky.

224
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
The sword is cut off.

225
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Even if it's a mountain,

226
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,140
I will wait for you.

227
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,140
The wind blows in the sky.

228
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Even if it's a mountain,

229
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,140
I will wait for you.

230
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,140
The wind blows in the sky.
