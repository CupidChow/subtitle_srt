To be continued...

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Brother Gu, I'm really sorry.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Take it.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The password is 666.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You'll have more space to spend money.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You've shown us hope.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll pay you back in the future.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's not important.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll go now.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Take good care of your wife.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
When Qiqi recovers,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
she'll invite us to your wedding with Miss Song.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You'd better not hold too much hope for this.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Mr. Gu.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Mr. Gu wants you to go back to the company.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't call me Mr. Gu.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've already withdrawn from the board of directors.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's about the Qimeng House.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Qimeng House?

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Dad.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Didn't you say there was a meeting today?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where is he?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Today is the meeting between us.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mr. Gu.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I won't let you get the Qimeng House.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why are you so aggressive?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Can't you sit down and talk?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Santa.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was there that day.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just didn't go in.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
When I saw you trying your best

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to create happiness and hope

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
for a couple who are not familiar,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I realized

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
that you were doing something meaningful.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
These days,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've investigated some

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
guests who used to live in your homestay.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Their comments on you

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
are very positive.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I just realized

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
that you've done a lot

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
for the homestay.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What he did say to you

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
was only cultural value

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and the value of the project.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Zi'an.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This time,

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm blaming you.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm old.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't want to

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
be a burden to you.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm old.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The company

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
will be your young people.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So,

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you have to come back

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and introduce your new plan

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
to the board.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Welcome to Gu Group.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Gu Group

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Gu Group

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Gu Group

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Aiyo.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That hurts.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where does it hurt?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
My stomach hurts.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll go get some medicine.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why are you back?

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
For what medicine?

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm taking that

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
Sun Mi, give me the secret code.

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,840
Hurry up.

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,160
Is this a public key or something?

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,000
I just remembered.

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,240
I'll remember it.

81
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,560
I'll buy the rich house.

82
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,560
Give me the secret code.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,960
Hurry up.

84
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,160
It's different from what we just saw.

85
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,080
It's the same.

86
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,880
Okay.

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,640
I can't run away.

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,920
Hurry up.

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,000
You must set the confession process today.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,680
While he's not here,

91
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,360
let's have a game.

92
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Do you think I should choose the day or night?

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,560
Night is romantic.

94
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,600
Night.

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:35,880
Okay.

96
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
Then we need to find a place with a light.

97
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,760
A place with a light.

98
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,000
I have something important to announce.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
Don't announce it yet.

100
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,280
Nothing is more important than

101
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
Zhu Gu Li's confession to Chen Duo.

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
Let's talk over there.

103
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,320
Go.

104
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
Zhu Gu Li.

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,760
Why did you choose this place?

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,920
I met him in Wuxi.

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
So I want to choose a place

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
with the best night view in Wuxi.

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
Let this city

110
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,680
witness this moment.

111
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,560
Who recommended this place to you?

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,160
It's Mr. Gu.

113
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
He said

114
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,480
this is where his happiness begins.

115
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,640
I've brought the bracelet for you.

116
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,000
It's blindfolded. It's in the car.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,520
Okay.

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,800
Then we'll do as planned.

119
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,300
If you have a sketch now

120
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,780
to bring the beautiful scenery to life,

121
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,140
then Wensente's new moon night will come.

122
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Excuse me.

123
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,360
Yes?

124
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,320
The request doesn't indicate anything.

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,920
There mustn't be any numerous people around.

126
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,280
I'm asking you.

127
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,040
Where are you?

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,240
Somewhere.

129
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,760
Before making any address,

130
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,480
I remembered that

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,760
there's someone

132
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,120
from the fiction company.

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,840
She was initially approached by a justice calmly.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,320
I went there and knew that

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,960
you are one of the victims.

136
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,880
Although I did not visit you.

137
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,920
During my prayers,

138
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,320
you gave me an accident.

139
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,200
And you are interested in me

140
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:56,200
of Dingxiang's

141
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,160
dancing.

142
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,720
So flattered

143
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,800
that your feet tech

144
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,860
are instrumented with

145
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,680
the多文化王邻的

146
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,720
Third, Tian Xiezuo.

147
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,320
My most hated thing

148
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,640
is to have a meeting with my dad.

149
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,840
I love soup buns

150
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,120
and the peach blossom cakes you made.

151
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,400
I first noticed you

152
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,160
when I was in school.

153
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,720
Your design gives me strength.

154
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,920
I've always wanted to get to know you.

155
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
But I admit

156
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,920
the first time I saw you

157
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
was different from what I imagined.

158
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,760
But I soon realized

159
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,680
I was not wrong.

160
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,120
Unknowingly,

161
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,040
I fell in love with your happiness and optimism.

162
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,280
I also yearned for your independence and strength.

163
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,320
I only knew

164
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,520
that business can't be a game.

165
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,240
But you made me realize

166
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,000
that love is never a game.

167
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
It's nothing more than a game in a mime.

168
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:26,520
I can doubt it.

169
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,880
Can I pursue you?

170
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
and terrify me?

171
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,020
I can handle it,

172
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,700
right?

173
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
You idiot!

174
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,280
When have I taught you

175
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,840
to nurture girls?

176
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,340
Would you please teach me again?

177
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,040
Then you listen carefully.

178
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
for the first time.

179
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Let memories change.

180
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Let dreams become a thread,

181
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
and a long thread with you.

182
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Let me draw a wind,

183
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
and kiss your ear.

184
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Kiss your face.

185
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Let me draw a rain,

186
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
and fall into the spring.

187
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
With you, I dream of the sky.

188
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Looking at the bright starry sky.

189
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Push away the old year's door.

190
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
In the dream of July,

191
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
we are like the moon and the sun.

192
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
In this Jiangnan water town

193
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
surrounded by rivers,

194
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
my dream

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
is really about to come true.

196
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Although there are some twists and turns in the process,

197
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
but fortunately, everything is fine.

198
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
In the end, I also gained a lot.

199
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Walking on the green stone road,

200
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
crossing the stream,

201
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
I humbly kiss under the moonlight.

202
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Hearing the wind of Huishan,

203
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
the sound of wind chimes.

204
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
In this city that is not in a hurry,

205
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
it seems that everything

206
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
will go away with the river.

207
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Only the fish in the water

208
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
comforts me

209
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,880
and sleeps in the dream.

210
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
All this is finally over.

211
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Old street,

212
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
my homestay,

213
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
I am back again.

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
And you and I

215
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
just started.

216
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
You.

217
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
My shares are all for you.

218
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
But the future development of homestay,

219
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
I think I still have to consider.

220
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Then do you want to sign a new agreement with me?

221
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,880
I want to wait for you under the peach tree.

222
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
The wind is sweet in the season.

223
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
In the sword, the four seasons are interlocked.

224
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,880
There is no word that can explain.

225
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Everything is settled.

226
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
The dream has a root.

227
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Love has teeth.

228
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
This place is so beautiful.

229
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
I brought you a dragon bag.

230
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
I'm almost home.

231
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Wait for you.

232
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
But the memories are so deep.

233
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
I don't leave any traces.

234
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,880
I wait for you under the peach tree.

235
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,880
The wind is sweet in the season.

236
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,880
In the sword, the four seasons are interlocked.

237
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,880
There is no word that can explain.

238
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Even if it's a mountain,

239
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,880
I have to chase your path.

240
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Like the wind and the rain.

241
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Even if it's a mountain,

242
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I have to chase your path.

243
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Like the wind and the rain.
