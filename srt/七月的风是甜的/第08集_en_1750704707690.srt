The Love by Hypnotic

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What a pity.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't have the talent to go to the kitchen.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Since my mother left,

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I have never tasted that flavor again.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You said you have a requirement.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want to see if I can use the original package.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My mother's biggest wish

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:29,440
is to pass down the peach blossom

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can do it.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Try it.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How is it?

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Congratulations. It's the flavor of your childhood.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Love by Hypnotic

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is...

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is my sudden imagination.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want your mother to follow the peach blossom

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and see the new era of the Great Lake

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in this way.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I wonder if you like it.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I like it.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I like it very much.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Try it.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
See if it tastes right.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Grandma, I want to eat it.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Eat it.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Try it.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's so delicious.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's delicious.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's the original flavor.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's delicious.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I seem to understand the legend of the legend.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The Love by Hypnotic

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
My mother likes this flavor.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's the same as the childhood flavor.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Really? Thank you.

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're welcome.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Try it.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There are more discounts.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You go ahead.

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hello, mom.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's wrong?

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Xinyue, do you remember?

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I always told you

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that there was an aunt in Wuxi.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I remember.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
She sent you the peach blossom book.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But then the phone number

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
was changed and you couldn't contact her.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know who sent me

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
a box of peach blossom books.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's the same flavor as the old days.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you think it's that aunt?

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't know.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Maybe.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mom, I'm not telling you.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm going to class.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Put your hand here.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's new.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Here.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll get you one.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, thanks.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We don't like sweets.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's different.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is your labor result.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There are many things in the store.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You should deal with them.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Take it away and deal with it.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Eat it or give it to someone.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You can't let my dad know about this.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't worry.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll make it clear to you.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is it delicious?

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We all like it.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Mom, don't be afraid.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mom, here.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Isn't he giving away the name card?

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why is he giving away the name card?

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why did he come to dig the books?

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And he gave me one.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What does this mean?

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Chairman, eat slowly.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What is this?

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What is this?

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's provoking me.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is like a sky.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Chairman, don't be angry.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The young people now

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
have their own way of doing things.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Maybe Ci'an did this

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
because he had his own plans.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Plan?

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Plan?

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm the one who's worrying about him.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I almost forgot.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let me introduce you.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is the business officer

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I hired from abroad.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He's the designer, Sun Peng.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you, sir.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He'll be involved in

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the planning of the ancient town business street.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You too.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Take Sun Peng to the homestay.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Get to know the situation.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Make sure you design it in advance.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't delay the next transformation.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is there a problem?

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I have no problem.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hello.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm Sun Peng.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Please take your time.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You really went to see my dad off?

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're out of your mind.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, I...

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're crazy about giving me a color test.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I thought you wanted to make the old man

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
take the short one.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Forget it.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I really can't afford to be angry with you.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That guy named Sun Peng

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
is a big deal.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Just drag him down.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How long do I have to drag him down?

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't think of a way to drag him down.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's wrong?

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're so impatient.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's okay.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's go.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's okay.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The travel agency is in trouble.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's been solved.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is there anything important?

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why are you wearing that dress?

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A classmate from school

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is visiting me.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's been a long time.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I shouldn't be joking.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Classmate?

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You should treat her to a good meal.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I have a good relationship with the restaurant manager.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Can I get a discount

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and get you a room?

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sure.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll tell him to take her to the restaurant.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
When did we arrive?

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a bit far.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I feel like

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
we've been going up in the air.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right?

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Impossible.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is the third time

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I've been to this place.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's right.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's the first time.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's the first time.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's the first time.

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I want to go there.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm not going there.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I want to go there.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I want to go there.

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The ground is round.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why is it not good to eat in the navigation?

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't worry.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I want to go to the toilet.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're a big boy.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The taste of memory

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is full of Jiangnan's luck.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I finally found it.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is the meaning of inheritance.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
How many generations

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,240
can recall the beauty of their

177
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll leave it to you.

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll leave it to you.

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll leave it to you.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll leave it to you.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll leave it to you.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll leave it to you.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll leave it to you.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll leave it to you.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll leave it to you.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll leave it to you.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll leave it to you.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll leave it to you.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll leave it to you.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll leave it to you.

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll leave it to you.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll leave it to you.

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll leave it to you.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll leave it to you.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll leave it to you.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll leave it to you.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll leave it to you.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll leave it to you.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll leave it to you.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll leave it to you.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll leave it to you.

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The four seasons are so different.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's no one to explain it.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Even if it's a mountain,

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll still pursue your path.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Just like the wind and the rain.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Even if it's a mountain,

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll still pursue your path.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Just like the wind and the rain.
