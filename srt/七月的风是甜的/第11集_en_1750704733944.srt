00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,000
How long will it take for my daughter to get here by taxi?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,320
About an hour.

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,880
How far is she going to travel?

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,760
She left earlier this morning.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
It'll take 40 minutes to get back.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,440
That should be enough.

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,960
Auntie, Yi Yi sent me the message

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,560
50 minutes ago.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,680
What?

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,680
Is she almost here?

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,760
Oh no, Yi Yi is here.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,800
She's getting off at the door.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Let's find a place to hide.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,160
I'll hide now.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,840
Auntie, don't move.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,400
Gu San,

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
find a big trash can that can hold people.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,040
I want a room that's next to my parents'.

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,920
Don't let me see it.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,120
Since you're parents',

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,280
you should listen to the show.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
It's exciting.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Sister Qi Yue.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,960
You're even prettier than your profile picture.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,440
You must be Yi Yi.

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,040
Thank you for this time.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,640
It's okay. It's not a problem.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,360
Do you need help?

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
No, thanks.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,720
You can go back to work.

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,040
Go ahead.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,440
I'm so tired.

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Auntie, don't move.

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
It's not safe yet.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,440
Call Uncle and ask where he is.

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
We'll meet him.

40
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Okay.

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
I can't reach him again.

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,960
This old man must be a jinx again.

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,040
Uncle told me this morning

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,480
that he's going to Taoxin Island today.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,720
But I don't know where exactly.

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,960
You'll definitely follow me.

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,600
Duo Duo won't last long.

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
Don't worry about it.

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,800
Let's go. We'll confirm it as we go.

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,920
Hello.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,240
I want to ask you about a man.

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,120
He's about this tall.

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Have you seen a man with glasses?

54
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,240
Thank you.

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,440
Have you seen a man with big eyes?

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
No.

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Auntie.

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,040
We've searched everywhere.

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
But we didn't see him.

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
This old man

61
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,280
must be a jinx again.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Wait.

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,960
He said he was going to plant a peach tree at home.

64
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
Peach tree?

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
Then I know where he is.

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,120
This is the modern agricultural industrial park of Huishan Country.

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,280
It's the main industry of Yangshan Water Peach.

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,680
This area is famous for its industry.

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Old Zhao.

70
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,160
You scared me.

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Why are you here?

72
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
Why are you here?

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,600
Why is your phone silent again?

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
You're always busy with these things.

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
I'll take them all out for you.

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
What do you know?

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,240
This is the new variety,

78
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,760
Yangshan No. 1 Water Peach.

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,360
Yangshan No. 1 Water Peach.

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,040
So much information.

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,560
Yiyi is here.

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,360
What?

83
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,240
Yiyi is here.

84
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,480
Yiyi is here?

85
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,200
Actually, Yiyi told me

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,760
not to let you know he's here.

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,160
He wants to observe the real situation of you two secretly.

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,640
Hurry.

89
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,040
Let's go back to Taoxin Island.

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,240
Chengduo said Yiyi has already brought it on the way.

91
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,480
Hurry.

92
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
Then let's go.

93
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,560
Uncle, aunt.

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,760
We have to go.

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,160
Otherwise, Yiyi will suspect us.

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,960
Don't go.

97
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,760
It's awkward for us to be here.

98
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,880
We can only sit here.

99
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Yes.

100
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,160
You two can play as you like.

101
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
Don't separate.

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
Just like you usually do in front of Yiyi.

103
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Be more harmonious.

104
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
Be more tacit.

105
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I'll go.

106
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I'll go.

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
I'll go.

108
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Don't you think it's inappropriate

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,720
for you to do this?

110
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,960
His daughter finally came here.

111
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,400
Her purpose is to see the real situation of his parents.

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,320
You're hiding it from his parents.

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,200
What's the point of him coming here?

114
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,400
Do you want to see their harmony

115
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,360
or show the truth?

116
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,880
See them separate without any worries.

117
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,160
Can you hide it for a while?

118
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
Can you hide it for a lifetime?

119
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,960
Yiyi is an adult.

120
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,760
He's going to leave home and go to college soon.

121
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,320
Their mission is about to be completed.

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Do you understand?

123
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,240
It's because they keep it a secret

124
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,000
that will make their relationship

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,120
get worse.

126
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,120
I don't think you know what family is.

127
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
I don't think you know the meaning of life.

128
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,520
Tell me.

129
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
You two.

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
You two.

131
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,360
Don't argue because of us.

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Calm down.

133
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
Fine.

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,920
I was bad at speaking.

135
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,840
I was harsh.

136
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,720
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
Move aside.

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
You're blocking the way.

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Uncle, auntie.

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,160
Come here.

141
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,080
I have an idea.

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
They're happy.

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
Look.

144
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
When Yiyi comes here,

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,000
you two take a picture here.

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,720
Simple.

147
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,640
No.

148
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,720
We can't take pictures in this kind of photo.

149
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,080
Yeah.

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,560
I can't take this.

151
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
How about you two

152
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,960
take a picture with us?

153
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,080
Gu Ci'an.

154
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,480
Me?

155
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Come here.

156
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,960
You two take a picture.

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,120
Come on.

158
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,720
The first one is like this.

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,600
The second one.

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
The second one.

161
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
The third one.

162
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,160
How is it?

163
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,560
Do you get it?

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,840
Yeah.

165
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,080
Try it.

166
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,160
Yeah.

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,080
Uncle and auntie.

168
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,840
Yiyi is on her way.

169
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,600
Remember

170
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
See you in the next episode.

171
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,200
Don't go.

172
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,400
Hurry up.

173
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,880
Come on.

174
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,000
This one, right?

175
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,520
No.

176
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,360
Not this one.

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,920
No, she...

178
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,640
How did you hear that?

179
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,560
She just put it like this.

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,400
The first one is this one.

181
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,080
Zhao.

182
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,800
Yiyi is in college now.

183
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,960
We are almost done.

184
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,640
How about

185
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,320
we play cards with her?

186
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
We always pretend like this.

187
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
When will it be the end?

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,680
Wait a minute.

189
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,560
Wait?

190
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,960
We tried to change it before.

191
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
No matter how long we wait,

192
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
we are so stubborn.

193
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,840
It's the same now.

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,920
Yiyi will find out sooner or later.

195
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,960
Enough.

196
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,040
Are you done?

197
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,520
Are you done?

198
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,920
Clean up after you finish drinking.

199
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
Go and light the incense.

200
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,280
Yiyi will be here soon.

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,680
Let's go.

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,680
Who is it?

203
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,120
It's Yiyi.

204
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,600
What did you say?

205
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,640
Dad, mom,

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,320
I've been wronged by you for so many years.

207
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
I know that

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,600
you sacrificed your personal happiness

209
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,560
to make me study hard.

210
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
I know that.

211
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
But I don't want to be a burden to you.

212
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,840
I don't want to be a burden to you.

213
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,160
I don't want to be a burden to you.

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
I sacrificed my personal happiness.

215
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,840
Now I'm in college.

216
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,240
You should find

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
the person you want.

218
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
Qingyuan, thank you for this time.

219
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,600
Auntie, don't mention it.

220
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,880
Come again next time.

221
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
I'm not going.

222
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
Where are you going to work tomorrow?

223
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
I haven't decided yet.

224
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,720
I want to buy a peach tree loan.

225
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,040
I don't want you to know me.

226
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
I have to think of a way.

227
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
I'll have to trouble you then.

228
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,680
Yes.

229
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Love is sweet.

230
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,840
The result of waiting.

231
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,360
A round peach

232
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,720
must be sweet.

233
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
It would be nice if

234
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,440
lovers can be sweet all the time.

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Love is sweet,

236
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,280
but love will disappear.

237
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
The sweetness is like eye disease.

238
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,440
It will only hurt each other and people around them.

239
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,640
Maybe you're right.

240
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,400
Maybe love is like a peach.

241
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,080
It will be bad if you keep it for a long time.

242
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
I think it's more like

243
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,200
you need to keep mixing the eggs and rice.

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,520
If you mix it for a long time,

245
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,600
the sweetness will be tasteful.

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
If you don't want to,

247
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
it will change.

248
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,200
It's so tiring to mix it.

249
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,640
There are always two people who love to toss and turn.

250
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,640
The sky is full of fragrance.

251
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Time is so silent.

252
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
But it remembers our love.

253
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
It doesn't leave a trace.

254
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,640
It says it wants to wait for you.

255
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,640
The wind in the moon is sweet.

256
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,640
The four seasons are interweaving.

257
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:40,640
There is no word to describe it.

258
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Even if it's a mountain,

259
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,640
we have to find a path.

260
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Just like the wind and the rain.

261
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Even if it's a mountain,

262
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,640
we have to find a path.

263
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Just like the wind and the rain.
