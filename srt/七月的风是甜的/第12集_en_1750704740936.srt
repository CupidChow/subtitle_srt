Episode 16

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,000
Open the room for me!

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,400
Qi Meng Ju?

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,400
Hello, do you have an appointment?

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,680
So advanced.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,040
You even have an appointment system.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,240
Young man, we don't

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,160
know how to make an appointment online.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,800
So...

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,640
It's okay.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,720
Your ID card.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,680
Go, go, go.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,400
This one.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,880
Someone is coming.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,480
I heard something.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,960
I don't know.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
I'll go check.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,400
Song Tian Xiong, Li Meizhen.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,240
Teacher.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,200
Your parents.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,400
My parents.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's go.

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,800
Your room is on the second floor.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,720
Follow me.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,320
Let's go.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,400
The Long Ballad

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
What?

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Your parents?

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,760
I was preparing some specials

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,800
for the uncle and aunt.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
Stop!

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,520
Why are you so blind?

36
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,440
You didn't see Qi Yue.

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,880
You don't want to see them at all.

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Seriously.

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,800
What do you mean?

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,760
Why are you hiding?

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,920
Since you're here,

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,840
let's play with them.

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,880
You must pretend

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,280
you don't know them.

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,640
I secretly came back

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,400
behind their back.

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,280
I also took their

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,880
original plan to buy a house in England

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,920
and open a homestay.

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,160
They don't know about all of this.

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,280
Duo Duo.

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,760
Did you secretly send a circle

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,080
to expose my whereabouts?

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Me?

55
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
How could I?

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,080
I even blocked your

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,040
ancestral tomb

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,880
by sending a circle.

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Now I can only pray

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
that they're really here to play.

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Go back after you're done.

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,760
Otherwise, I, the owner of the homestay,

63
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,920
will pay the hotel's rent

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,680
for others.

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Wait and see.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Uncle, aunt.

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,440
Little boy, sit.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,920
Little Gu.

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
Why didn't I see you become the boss?

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,040
I'm the boss here.

71
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,680
How long have you been here?

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,360
About a year and a half.

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,640
I can't remember the details.

74
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,600
I think your decoration is quite good.

75
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,320
Which designer designed it?

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
It's our...

77
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,320
It's our designer

78
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
who paid 7,000 yuan.

79
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes.

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
Little boy.

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,640
I think your business is quite good.

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,360
Can you manage to do it alone?

83
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,160
And other colleagues.

84
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
We're the staff.

85
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Uncle, aunt.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,600
I have something to do in the shop.

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,480
I'll leave first.

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,040
Little Gu.

89
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,720
Little Gu.

90
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,360
Don't go.

91
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,800
I have something to ask you.

92
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,000
I didn't ask you successfully.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,080
It's your fault.

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,600
How can you blame me?

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,160
You're back.

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,960
How are my parents these days?

97
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Is there anything strange?

98
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Nothing strange.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
I'm almost strange.

100
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
It's okay.

101
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,000
They're all fine.

102
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,520
I saw your aunt post on WeChat.

103
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,760
I even learned to take selfies.

104
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm happy.

105
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,640
They all took selfies in the homestay.

106
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,560
They've been to the farthest place

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
in the past few days.

108
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,000
It's at the door of the homestay.

109
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,440
Forget it.

110
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,240
Let's eat first.

111
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,640
Oh no.

112
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Mom's video.

113
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,840
Hello, mom.

114
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,520
What's wrong with you?

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,440
You woke me up

116
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
when I posted the video.

117
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,640
Oh, I forgot that it's night time.

118
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Your dad and I are in Uxian.

119
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
I saw your photo

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
at the homestay.

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,280
What homestay?

122
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
I forgot it.

123
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,160
Qimengju.

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,360
I remember it.

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
During the summer vacation last year,

126
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,040
Duo Duo and I

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
took photos when we went to Uxian.

128
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
Didn't you say that

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
you went to

130
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,080
the Helsinki in Finland last summer?

131
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,880
What Helsinki?

132
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,800
It's the southern part of the country.

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
Miss Song.

134
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,880
So live.

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,360
Mom, I'm sorry.

136
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,240
I'll tell you later.

137
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,880
Come back.

138
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,560
Uncle and aunt,

139
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,760
won't you stay longer?

140
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,400
Wuxi is a good place.

141
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,640
It's clear and clean.

142
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,600
The air is fresh.

143
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
But we have something else to do.

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,960
Next time.

145
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,240
I look forward to

146
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
your next visit.

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,480
Definitely.

148
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,840
If we don't go to the UK

149
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,680
to see our daughter,

150
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,760
we'll stay here

151
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,360
for a few more days.

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,200
Uncle and aunt.

153
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,640
We have delivery service at the homestay.

154
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,800
I'll take a car

155
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,760
to send uncle and aunt to the airport.

156
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,040
Thank you.

157
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,520
Thank you.

158
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,480
What?

159
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,800
Go to the UK?

160
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,080
What should I do now?

161
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,520
Hello?

162
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,760
I don't know.

163
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,960
I haven't decided yet.

164
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,560
I'll try to delay the event.

165
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Hurry up.

166
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,280
We can call and keep in touch.

167
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,760
Uncle and aunt.

168
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,840
I'll go to the airport.

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
I'll come back later.

170
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,640
Okay.

171
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,480
Bye.

172
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,320
Gu.

173
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,040
Look.

174
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,800
It's too much trouble for you.

175
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
Don't be so polite.

176
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,920
Uncle and aunt.

177
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,320
I feel very close

178
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,840
to you two.

179
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,240
Next time you come to Wuxi,

180
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
you must notify me in advance.

181
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,800
What are you going to do?

182
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
I don't know.

183
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
Why don't you be honest?

184
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,480
Are you really going to the UK?

185
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,000
The ticket fee is small.

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,640
If they really find you are not there,

187
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,800
it will be over.

188
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,320
I'm mainly worried

189
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,040
that they'll call me back to my hometown.

190
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,680
You're managing the homestay well.

191
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,800
You have fixed income every month.

192
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,440
You're so stubborn.

193
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I don't think they'll let you go back.

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,600
By the way,

195
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,680
what time is our flight today?

196
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,840
Four thirty.

197
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
It's still early.

198
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,440
I'll take uncle and aunt

199
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,120
to visit the uneducated park

200
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,560
of Huishan.

201
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,360
Actually,

202
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
there is another kind of scenery

203
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,520
when you look at the scenery in the car.

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,720
It's almost three o'clock.

205
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,000
We can't go there for long, can we?

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes.

207
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,920
We can go there for a minute.

208
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a minute.

209
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
Hello.

210
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Where are you now?

211
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,320
We're on our way to the airport.

212
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,880
Turn on the light now.

213
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
I have something to say.

214
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,120
Dad, mom.

215
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,400
Isn't that our daughter's voice?

216
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,360
Qi Yue.

217
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,200
Mom, it's me.

218
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't go to the UK to find me.

219
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm in Wuxi.

220
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,240
See you at the homestay.

221
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,240
Do you take me and your dad

222
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,200
as your family

223
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
and come back from abroad

224
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
to learn how to start a business?

225
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,400
You didn't take the medicine.

226
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,040
Or we gave you too much freedom.

227
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,600
You're so...

228
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,360
You spoiled our child.

229
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,440
No.

230
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll give you a week

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
to sell this homestay

232
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,600
and then go home with me.

233
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,680
Ya Hui, you go back by yourself.

234
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,040
I can't sell the homestay.

235
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,720
It's my long-term dream and dream.

236
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,520
What dream?

237
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,240
You've been thinking about it since you were a kid.

238
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,040
You want to go abroad.

239
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
We'll go abroad with you.

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
If you want to go abroad,

241
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,440
you can go abroad secretly.

242
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,920
And you can set up a homestay.

243
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,760
When can you give us some credit?

244
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,560
When can I not give you credit?

245
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,400
You...

246
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
Ma'am, don't be angry.

247
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,160
We're serious about starting a homestay.

248
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,760
Look.

249
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,560
Our business is going up.

250
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,920
It's a pity to give up now.

251
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
Hello, ma'am.

252
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,800
Let's go.

253
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
The roof of the platform building is very high.

254
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,520
It's easy to walk and walk.

255
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,560
The street is well-known.

256
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,440
It's good to bring the elders here.

257
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,520
The elders said they liked it.

258
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,920
They said it's much better than

259
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,240
the London's top tower.

260
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,840
It seems that you didn't hide from your parents.

261
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,520
Will you go back?

262
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,120
My dream

263
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,040
won't give up so soon.

264
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,080
The sunset is Мне, the light is richly blood.

265
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,080
It brings the ups and downs.

266
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,440
It is Sixteenitan.

267
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
Time keepれる.

268
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,900
But muscle morning comes.

269
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,320
I don't pocket the marks.

270
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,320
The secret under the peach tree

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
The wind in the new moon is sweet

272
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
The four seasons are interweaving

273
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,320
There is no word that can describe you

274
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Even if it's a mountain and a moon

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I will follow your footsteps

276
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Just like the wind following the rain

277
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Even if it's a mountain and a moon

278
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,320
I will follow your footsteps

279
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Just like the wind following the rain

280
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
The four seasons are interweaving
