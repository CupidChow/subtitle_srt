1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,880
Like a fate, by each other's side

2
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,880
Episode 16

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,920
Chairman, I'm not lying to you.

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Mr. Gu is the most...

5
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,000
He's been doing a good job in recovering the B&B.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Shut up!

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,800
Don't move. I'll call the police.

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Don't move.

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm not lying to you, Chairman.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,800
It's okay if you don't tell me.

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,040
I'll send someone to check it out.

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,480
From now on, you can't go anywhere.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,280
Stay here and wait for my news.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Okay.

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,160
Come, look at your peach blossom.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
I'll go.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,320
The answer is right here.

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,680
Someone is having a crush on you.

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,200
You're so lucky to have this.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Besides, who else is there besides you?

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Zuo Dong, do you have any other plans?

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,000
What about Gu Ci'an?

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
Don't talk nonsense.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Say it again.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Hurry.

26
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
You believe in your intuition?

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Look.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
It's definitely him.

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Gu Ci'an.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Come.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:52,200
Gu Qi'an describes yours

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,480
You're not a good girl.

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Hurry up and get me out of here.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,200
Wait a minute. I have a stomachache.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,640
Hurry up. Don't give me the toothbrush.

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,240
Okay, okay, okay. I know. I know.

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Hurry up.

38
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,920
What are you looking at?

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,040
Haven't you seen the handsome guy in the bathroom?

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
You're the boss.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
Take care of your image.

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,760
Just leave this little thing to me.

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm trying to help you work.

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,200
Is this a good thing?

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I can't do it.

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I can't do it.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Do you have money?

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
How much did you pay for renting this homestay?

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
What do you mean?

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
I'll give you three times the compensation.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
It's enough for you to live here.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm not going to live here.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm not going to live here.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll give you three times the compensation.

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
It's enough for you to live in a better hotel.

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
You pack up and leave now.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Are you crazy?

58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I just opened my luggage and you let me go.

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
You're looking for tea or a teacup?

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Five times.

61
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
You're not allowed to write a teacup.

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
How much do you want?

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,880
You can change a hotel owner.

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,280
I'll treat you to dinner.

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,000
And I'll pay for your room.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Three times the compensation.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Pack up and leave right away.

68
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,200
You'll live in this hotel.

69
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,100
I didn't even have a chance to single out a hotel

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,200
when I first came here.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,920
Sir,

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,080
are you dissatisfied with our homestay?

74
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,800
No.

75
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Something happened at home.

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,320
I can't stay here.

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,920
Sorry.

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Sorry.

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,520
Gu San,

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,680
what's going on?

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,800
They said

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,120
something happened at home.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,920
Some said the child was sick.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Some said their parents were hospitalized.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
Some said they were welcomed by their family.

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,440
They rushed back.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,640
Is there anything wrong with the family?

88
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,680
Why are you so happy?

89
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,440
What's going on today?

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,680
The guests have left the hotel.

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
They even cleaned the campus.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
Didn't they say something happened?

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,080
They can understand each other's problems.

94
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,400
They can have their own problems.

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
Don't worry.

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
The old ones don't go.

97
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,720
The new ones don't come.

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,560
Then tell me,

99
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,600
where are the new ones?

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,120
It's full.

101
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
I told you not to worry.

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,920
You've been working hard recently.

103
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,320
I'll take you to eat something good.

104
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,160
Relax.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm not going.

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
After all, it's not good to have no one in the homestay.

107
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,640
You two go ahead.

108
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,280
Wait for me.

109
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,520
I'll go to the bathroom.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,320
Hello, boss.

111
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm opening the room.

112
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,720
Well, there's no room.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
Impossible.

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,560
I made a order.

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,520
Impossible.

116
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,800
It's full.

117
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
Where did you make the order?

118
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,680
Look.

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Impossible.

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,280
Well, you can cancel the order.

121
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,240
Three times the monthly fee.

122
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,480
What do you mean?

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,760
Who do you look down on?

124
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
Five times.

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Ten times is useless.

126
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
I'm destined today.

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,080
If you keep talking nonsense,

128
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,320
I'll complain to you.

129
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
Where's your boss?

130
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,480
Boss.

131
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
I'm the boss here.

132
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
There's no business that can't be talked about in this world.

133
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,280
Only if you give me enough benefits,

134
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,960
how much do you want to leave?

135
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm really open today.

136
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,520
You actually said it here.

137
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,800
Twenty times.

138
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,560
Get a horse.

139
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,120
Hurry up.

140
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,800
Gu Zi Lan.

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,120
Qin Yue, listen to me first.

142
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,720
Explain what?

143
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
You're here to make fun of me.

144
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,000
You're bored, aren't you?

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,320
I have my reasons.

146
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,000
What reasons?

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're crazy here.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,040
No, I'm tired of watching you.

149
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,480
I want you to rest.

150
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,920
You're my little kid.

151
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Qin Yue.

152
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,160
Qin Yue.

153
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,800
I'll give you another chance.

154
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,320
What are you doing?

155
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,440
I really can't say that.

156
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,680
It's okay if you don't say it.

157
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
It's okay if you don't say it.

158
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
I'll send someone to see it myself.

159
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,560
Tell me.

160
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,960
I really can't say that.

161
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,920
You can't say it, right?

162
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,200
If you can't say it, get out of here.

163
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,920
Oh my god.

164
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,760
Who is this?

165
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
Uncle Zhang.

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Doesn't he also care about you?

167
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,400
He doesn't have to drive everyone away.

168
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,600
He wants to ruin my career because he cares about me.

169
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,040
If he likes me, he'll kill me.

170
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,680
I think...

171
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,880
Is there something he can't tell you?

172
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,280
That's why he's like this.

173
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,200
Stop.

174
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't be so nice to him.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,440
You're my sister.

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,920
Sister?

177
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,760
I'm doing this for you.

178
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
You're right.

179
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,800
He's hiding something from me.

180
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,080
He's hiding something from me.

181
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,760
Hey.

182
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,800
That's not right.

183
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,200
That's what he said in the book.

184
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,720
Then stop and take a rest.

185
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,960
Calm down.

186
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,920
Look at this city that's not in a hurry.

187
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,520
On the road to pursue dreams,

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,760
you have to stop and wait for the wind to come.

189
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,520
Actually, I'm waiting for my guests who were driven away.

190
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,680
I'm afraid that I can't keep it.

191
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,440
I shouldn't come, but I come.

192
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,880
The wind is blowing, the horse is flying.

193
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,880
I only know that my career is going to be ruined.

194
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,080
Wait for the wind to come.

195
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,520
The wind is blowing, the horse is flying.

196
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I only know that my career is going to be ruined.

197
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Wait for the wind to come.

198
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,520
The wind is blowing, the horse is flying.

199
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,520
I only know that my career is going to be ruined.

200
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Wait for the wind to come.

201
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,520
The wind is blowing, the horse is flying.

202
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,520
I only know that my career is going to be ruined.

203
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Wait for the wind to come.

204
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,520
The wind is blowing, the horse is flying.

205
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,520
The wind is blowing, the horse is flying.

206
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,520
The leaps on the shoulders are intense.

207
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:06,520
There is no word that can explain.

208
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Even if it is over the hills and the strait,

209
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I have to pursue the path of your shadow.

210
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,520
It's like a wind following a rain.

211
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Even if it's a mountain of clouds and clouds

212
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,520
I will chase after your self

213
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Just like the wind and the rain
