1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
our love will be forever.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Happy birthday to you.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Happy birthday to you.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Happy birthday to you.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Happy birthday to you.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Happy birthday, baby.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Happy birthday to you.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who is he?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Why are you back?

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
People say

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
don't give a surprise to your partner.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because a surprise

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
can be a shock.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let me see you.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let me see you.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
About this,

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I am at the height step of Ohãƒ£ you.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I didn't just want some one

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to tell me how to Crazy Girl.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I just want you to see these

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
as your great fieldwork.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When you are on a part of make-up

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've never thought that I would be so depressed

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
after being educated so much.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've never thought that my boyfriend who I loved for 7 years

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
would betray me.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Master, let's go to Yangshan Old Street.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you here for a trip?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No, I'm here to settle down.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You have such a good taste.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The food we have in Wuxi is incredible.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We have a lot of delicious food.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We can't wait to eat them all.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you mean by that?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You'll know it later.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Look forward to it.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm also looking forward to the future.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yangshan Old Street

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yangshan Old Street

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There's no noise here.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's no fast-paced life.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I really like it here.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How about we settle down here

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and open a homestay?

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll be the boss.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You'll be the man behind the boss.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
May I ask

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
what name this smart and talented gentleman

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
gave us?

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's call it

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Qiyue Little House.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No way.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You just thought of this.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Qiyue,

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
no matter what it's called,

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
as long as I can be with you, it's good.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then I'll design

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
this homestay in the future.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, I'll listen to you.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
As long as you're happy.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yangshan Old Street

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
Now that we'veatan

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the meeting should be starting.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,520
Our company is responsible for the renovation project

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,760
of the old street in Yangshan.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,680
The project has been promoted by 70%.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Most of the tenants

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
are very cooperative with us.

71
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,600
They are willing to communicate with us

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,680
about the decoration in the store.

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
But

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
only this one.

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,560
The owner of this homestay

76
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
is very uncooperative with our work.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,960
He means

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,400
the decoration of this store

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
has taken a lot of effort.

80
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,360
So,

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
they are not very satisfied

82
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
with the compensation.

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
We should discuss with them

84
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,760
and try to give them

85
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,600
a satisfactory answer.

86
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,640
But our budget

87
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
is limited.

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
The compensation they want

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,160
is much more than our budget.

90
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Leave this matter to me.

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,080
Miss, the cake shop is here.

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,560
Over. Over.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,080
Touch me.

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,240
Mr. Gu, I can't understand.

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
Why are you in stereo

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,720
doing something explicarable?

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,040
Next question.

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Why do all the bossy presidents like to pretend to be so unpredictable?

99
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,040
I heard it.

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Mr. Gu, I'll buy you a milk tea.

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,040
The design is very Richard's late-night style. I like it.

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
You know a lot about the industry.

103
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Did you also learn architecture when you came?

104
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,040
No, it's just my personal preference.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,040
You said everything was Belgique style.

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:12,040
She's nothing more than a typical Questo-style beauty.

107
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,380
Baby

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,760
There are people I admire

109
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
all regard I am

110
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,040
and will be

111
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,380
However one day

112
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,660
where I go

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,580
there is a man

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,220
watching for me

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,820
A star

116
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,800
that shines bright

117
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,640
is walking towards me

118
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,080
I don't lose an eye

119
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,080
cold or hurt

120
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't go

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Then who am I?

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Meng Tian.

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Enough, stop talking.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How long have you been together?

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Seven years.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Seven years?

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You've been together for seven years?

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Dong Zhuo, you bastard!

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I finally know why this homestay is called Seven Months' House.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You lied to me that

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
it was because we've been together for seven months,

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
that's why it's called this name.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How did I fall in love with someone like you?

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I paid you five years' rent?

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll give you two days to transfer the money to my card.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Otherwise, we're not done.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why did you suddenly come back?

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you didn't come back,

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
there wouldn't be so many things.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Dong Zhuo.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're so disgusting now.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Song Qi Yue, why are you blaming me?

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where have you been?

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
All these years we've been together,

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it's all up to you.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You said you went abroad to study, so you went abroad to study.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Have you considered my feelings?

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm a man, too.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I need company, too.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Have you seen a woman's clothes all these years?

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Get out of here!

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Devil.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Although you designed this homestay,

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you paid the decoration fee.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But the rent contract was signed by me.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm the owner of this store.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Give me back my decoration fee.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Your money is all on this bridge.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If you're capable, you can tear it down.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You...

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hello.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Do you need help?

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Everything is about life.

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Nothing is too big.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Everything will be fine.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Life will always be like our Taiwan.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But after the rain, it will be sunny.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Come on.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There are many good people in Wuxi.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You won't be alone.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's right.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I met someone today.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This person must be a ghost.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Please cherish it.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Time is so silent.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But it's so hard to remember.

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It leaves no traces.

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's said to wait for you.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The wind blows in the new moon.

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The four seasons stop at the sword.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No word can explain it.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Even in the mountains and mountains,

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I will follow your path.

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just like the wind and the rain.

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Even in the mountains and mountains,

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I will follow your path.

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just like the wind and the rain.
