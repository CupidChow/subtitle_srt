1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,720
Like we're by each other's side

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You guys

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Fine, you don't have to return it

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
From now on, we're not leaving

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's see how you do business

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dong Zhennan

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This group of people

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's very likely to become

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Our future

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The direction of the whole change

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A breakthrough

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't think we should take it back

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The ancient town business district

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The whole change involves various aspects

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You expect everyone to

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Your personal taste

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Come again

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I mean, if you were wrong at the beginning

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You were wrong at the beginning

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A bunch of nonsense

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can pay you back

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I don't have the money now

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You give me two months

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I promise two months later

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All the benefits are returned to you

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why should we believe you

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You yellow cat

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You ran away tomorrow

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who do we want money from

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Brother, call home

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Tell home

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We'll live here for two days

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How do you live here

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How do I do business

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I can't do business

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What do you get back

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I send seven months

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Always count

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Two months

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I do not believe

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can write you a visa now

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Row

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are not unreasonable

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But you have to find one

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Local people to make you insurance

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Big brother

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're a little too much

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I am a foreigner

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Where do I go to find you an insurance person?

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll give you two more weeks

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Just two weeks

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let the people in the homestay

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Agree with our reform plan

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't mention to me again

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Those childish ideas

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't eat

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She doesn't understand

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She must be in trouble recently

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Go and go to the contract room with me

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
it is good

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When will you call the insurance person?

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Should be soon

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's noon

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's order takeout

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Big brother, I want to eat chicken

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What chicken

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Eat hot pot

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You go to the next market to buy some meat

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Buy some more dishes

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll find a pot here

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't have a pot here

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We have to sit here

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's okay if there is no pot

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You two big men

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you capable of bullying a girl?

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What do you say

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Come

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is Gu Xiaoxuan

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Wang brother

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I will explain it to you

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Uncle

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This fruit is rotten

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you want to buy fruit?

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What to buy

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Go out

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sorry, Mr. Gu

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
With you as an insurance

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We are relieved

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We are relieved

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Then we will go back first

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Turn around

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
For your rough road and impulsive

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Say something to this girl

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Sorry Miss Song

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That we go back

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just your contract

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
With this Mr. Gu as an insurance

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That payment date

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then trouble you

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hurry up and turn around

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your business card is so good

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Their boss owes us

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The rental car of the travel agency

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Should be able to give me a few pieces of the mask

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Travel agency

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What is the reason this time

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is it still a knife to help

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What is the reason

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
To be precise

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
To be precise

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Should be a gift from the snow

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Not for free

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wait for your homestay to win

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Just give me some pink

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How can you be so sure

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My homestay will definitely win

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have no business until now

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Two months to earn one million

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have no bottom in my heart

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This investment

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Not looking at the present

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But the future

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No matter what, I still have to thank you

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Helped me again

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
As your homestay insurance

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I need to understand

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Your homestay business background

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Wait a minute

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Before this

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have two things to do

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I have to go to the hospital

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have to go to the hospital

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have to go to the hospital

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have to go to the hospital

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have to go to the hospital

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have to go to the hospital

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have to go to the hospital

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have to go to the hospital

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have to go to the hospital

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have to go to the hospital

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have to go to the hospital

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have to go to the hospital

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have to go to the hospital

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have to go to the hospital

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have to go to the hospital

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to go to the hospital

156
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have to go to the hospital

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I have to go to the hospital

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I have to go to the hospital

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have to go to the hospital

160
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have to go to the hospital

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have to go to the hospital

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I have to go to the hospital

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have to go to the hospital

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Mr. Gu

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mr. Gu has sent a message

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that he has burned down the name tag of the homestay

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
According to this progress

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
if he doesn't show his skills

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
he will definitely win

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You deserve this case

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are good at doing things

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
fast

173
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
accurate

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and ruthless

175
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't look at him

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He usually agrees

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
with you

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He is right

179
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He is right

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He is right

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He is right

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He is right

183
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He is right

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He is right

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He is right

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He is right

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He is right

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He is right

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He is right

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He is right

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is right

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He is right

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This kind of case

194
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's common to be stubborn

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's common to be stubborn

196
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's common to deal with women

197
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's common to deal with women

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It has the traditional sense

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Cool

200
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The first day for the reception

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I smashed my signature

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
You're the boss.

203
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,200
I shouldn't have named it that.

204
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,360
Then it's called

205
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,000
Yangshan Little House.

206
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
It's not very nice.

207
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
Think of another one.

208
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,800
It's called Peach Blossom Garden House.

209
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,360
This one sounds nice.

210
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,920
It's called Qi Meng Ju.

211
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,000
Sleep.

212
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,280
The names are so casual.

213
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,560
Your new house

214
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,680
and the Algiers Garden

215
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,400
are not similar in cost to yours.

216
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,520
When my viewers

217
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
looked at the features of your house

218
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
tagged down in their mind,

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,720
it harmonized with the Antique maybe takes

220
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,080
but doesn't take you to my house.

221
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,600
Sit down.

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
not a complete business plan.

223
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
The attractive rule is

224
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,240
as long as you believe you can do it,

225
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,760
all the power of the universe

226
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,120
will be on your side.

227
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,320
I won't let you suffer

228
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,920
for the thing you promised me.

229
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,120
The share of the homestay is 10% of you.

230
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,240
Now we are

231
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,600
on the same boat.

232
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
So your belief

233
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
is also mine.

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let me draw a wind

235
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to caress your ears

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and caress your face

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let me draw a cloud

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
to fall asleep in the middle of the night

239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and dream of the sky with you

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Looking at the old promise

241
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that we made before

242
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Push open the door of the heart

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that is filled with you

244
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The dream of the moon

245
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
is like a wish with you and me

246
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In each other's eyes

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's like a wish

248
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
in each other's eyes

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's here.

250
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why there is no sign?

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is it so expensive?

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are...

253
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wu Xizhi is really the best.

254
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wang Xizhi, Lu Dingyi, Sun Yefang

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Many famous people

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
are from Wu Xiren.

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Xue Muqiao, Hu Fuming, Feng Qiyong, Li Jinyong

258
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Kuang Zhongmou, Ding Nengzhao

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Many of them are still living in the old house.

260
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You can go and have a look.

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will also open my Qimeng house

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and get a new place to live with them.

263
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wang Xizhi studied in Linchi

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and became a scholar

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
after he was lonely.

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Behind every sign of light and heart

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
there are countless efforts.

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on.

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If the sun sets and the golden lake

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
brings the seven-moon fire

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and the sky is full of sweet fragrance

272
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Time is so big and it's so quiet

273
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
but it's so hard to remember

274
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and it leaves no traces

275
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
under the peach tree

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The wind is sweet

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and the bridge is steep

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There is no word to describe it

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Even if it's a mountain

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will follow your footsteps

281
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
like the wind and the rain

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Even if it's a mountain

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I will follow your footsteps

284
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
like the wind and the rain
