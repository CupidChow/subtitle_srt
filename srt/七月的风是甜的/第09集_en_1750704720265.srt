The Long Ballad

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 16

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm so embarrassed to be here.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Luckily, I have Gu Zi Dan

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to help me.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't mention my bad things.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Tell me why you came to Wuxi.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I got an offer from a real estate company.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They like my design

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and want me to help them

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
build a business street.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Slow down.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sorry, the water is too hot.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You can talk about

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
your study abroad.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm quite interested.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's there to talk about

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
about study abroad?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's similar to the domestic one.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sun Peng, do you remember

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
we had a hard time eating out?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He had to stay at home...

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Speaking of food,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
why don't you tell your friend

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
about the revamping of the peach blossom?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Qi Yue

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
is really poor

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
in order to

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
revamp the traditional dessert.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And we also visited

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
many old people in Wuxi.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wait.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He seems to be my classmate.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Get out of the way.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How long are you going to stay here?

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I haven't decided yet.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If something goes well,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I might not leave.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You won't?

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sorry.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's not that bad.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Boss, it's over.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sun Peng said he was going to the toilet.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He disappeared from the toilet.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where do you think he could go?

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He's right next to the kitchen.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's eating at the kitchen.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No matter what you do,

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
call Sun Peng back.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can do it right away.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What?

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He ran away?

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I was on my way to see him off.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He said he was going to the toilet.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But he ran away from the toilet.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
When I found him,

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
guess what?

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He was eating with his friend.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Chairman,

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the designer you hired

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
seems to be out of work.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Impossible.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When I met him,

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
he was quite stable.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How could he do something like that?

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Chairman,

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
what I said is all true.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He was honest

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
in front of you.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're the boss after all.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He might be doing something behind your back.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why don't you call him yourself?

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You want me to teach you?

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hello, Sun Peng.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Dad, here's the thing.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Designers need to be examined in advance.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There's not enough information in the book.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Only personal feelings

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
can really design the essence of culture and art.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's enough to understand.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can design a rough design for a week.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No one needs to accompany me.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can do it myself.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't worry.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Since I promised you,

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll do my best.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
These books

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
are all about local architecture.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've stayed in Wuxi for a long time.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I feel like I've chosen the right place.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's nice here.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The scenery is beautiful.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The food is delicious.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The pace of life is not that fast.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
By the way,

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
what about your girlfriend

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
if you work here?

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I broke up with her.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What are your plans for the future?

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I haven't decided yet.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I may leave after finishing my work.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I may stay here for a long time.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Qi Yue,

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what kind of girlfriend do you want?

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course I want you to stay here for a long time.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
When I'm bored,

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
we can be like when we were in school.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We can walk around and enjoy the scenery together.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We can eat delicious food.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What kind of person is Sun Peng?

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have to teach him a lesson.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I've been there.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll take you to play.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I know you don't like green onion.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You remember it?

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Of course.

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Last time we came to our party,

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
we cooked a special dish.

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The Westerners cooked onion and lamb.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The Qingdao people cooked green onion and seafood.

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The Beijing people cooked beef and silk.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
After eating,

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
it's just rice.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I didn't eat anything.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Since then,

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I know you don't like

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
everything related to green onion.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was hungry and came back to the dorm.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I made two packs of instant noodles for myself.

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can add noodles when you eat in our dorm.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Waiter, add two packs of noodles for him.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Are you okay?

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you okay?

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The book says

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
someone is going to confess to Qi Yue today.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No way.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The devil boss

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is going to confess to Qi Yue.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No way.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's going to confess to Qi Yue.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No way.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's going to confess to Qi Yue.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No way.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No way.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But it seems that it's not going to work.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's good.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Boss,

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is everything going well over there?

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If it goes on like this,

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
everyone will run away.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Go back to the company and work overtime.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have something to do.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm leaving first.

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll take the towel.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Chairman, please look.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You know how to work.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're very detailed.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It means

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I didn't see it wrong.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sun Peng is indeed

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
understanding our local culture in Wuxi.

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Young man,

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you're good.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mr. Gu,

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
what I want to express

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
doesn't seem to mean that.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Look.

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
From the first day he came to our company,

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
until now,

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
he hasn't seen anything serious.

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's eating and having fun all day.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What do you know?

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He knows the characteristics of our local people.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's checking the characteristics of the business community.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's the most important focus of his work now.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let me tell you.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You must keep him company.

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Make sure his life is well-arranged.

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Arrange it well.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you have anything,

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
just tell the company.

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000

193
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I know.

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
New project, right?

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No problem.

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I just found a designer from abroad.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's have a meeting tomorrow

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and study it.

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Anything else?

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Nothing.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Nothing.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't you have to work every day?

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This homestay

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
doesn't seem to belong to you.

207
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Stop.

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I want to ask you

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
how long you're going to stay here.

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
When can you finish your work?

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You should know better

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
about my work situation than I do.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you mean?

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm going back to the company

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to attend the overall planning meeting.

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll come to you and say hello to you.

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't be coming these days.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But I've already thought about it.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm going to rent a house nearby.

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to bother you for the next few days.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hello, this is Qimeng Jun homestay.

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's a house tomorrow.

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
One big bed.

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No problem.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I met an old friend

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and treated him to a peach.

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I wish he could have more peach in his mouth

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and a happy life.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please mark the location of the document.

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you want to pay a copyright fee?

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't have the right to do so

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
because it's not suitable.

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think it's suitable.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's more fun to meet old friends.

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because you don't care about the feeling of peach.

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The wind in the July is sweet

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The bridge on the four seasons

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There is no word that can explain

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Even if it's a mountain and a mountain,

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I will follow your path

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Just like the wind and the rain

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Even if it's a mountain and a mountain,

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will follow your path

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Just like the wind and the rain
