1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
our love will be by each other's side.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 18

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Qi Yue,

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you may not know

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that I've been preparing for this ring for a long time.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't know since when

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
my feelings for you

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
have exceeded the limits of my friends.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh my god.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is Sun Meng doing?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why does it look so real?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Qi Yue,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know it may be sudden

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for you to feel this way.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But I really don't want

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to hide my feelings anymore.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My love for you

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is not a gorgeous performance,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but a song that will always be with you.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Sun Meng,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that's enough.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Enough.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The play is a bit over.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Qi Yue,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm serious.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll call my parents tomorrow

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to meet with my uncle and aunt.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Qi Yue,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll make you the happiest girl in the world.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's enough.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't want to pretend anymore.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Dad,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
mom,

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I lied to you.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sun Peng and I

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
are not a couple.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I forced him to play the role with me.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sun Peng,

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You don't have to apologize.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have nothing to say now.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you want me to go back to my hometown

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to make you happy,

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll pack up my luggage now.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Qi Yue.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Gu Ci'an,

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
thank you for taking care of me these days.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll leave my homestay to you.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Stop!

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you sure you want to go back with us?

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I've thought it over.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you don't agree with what I'm doing now,

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll go back with you.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course I don't agree.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But the problem is,

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
do you agree with it?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Your mom is asking you.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Do you have any confidence

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in this homestay?

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I...

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Do I have any confidence?

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Tell me.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I...

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't have any confidence.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm not sure

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can fully fill the homestay.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have a loss.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Song Qi Yue, what are you talking about?

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No matter what difficulties you have faced before,

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
you won't give up.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No matter what kind of customers you meet,

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you can provide the most thorough service.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Besides, you also found

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the most delicious peach blossom pastry in Quan Wu Xi.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Girlfriend,

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
look at you.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have so many

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
great partners.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You should have confidence in yourself.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Enough!

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Get out of the way!

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't give me a bad face.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Actually,

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
since the day we received the peach blossom pastry,

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
we knew that

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you opened this homestay.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What?

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You lied to me?

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You lied to me first, okay?

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Enough.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your mom

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
was really angry at that time.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She wanted to

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
come to Wu Xi to find you immediately.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But when she ate

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the peach blossom pastry,

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
she had nothing to say.

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She also knew

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
that you

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
really found

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
the taste of the past.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And we believe

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that you really

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
want to

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
make this homestay

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
your own business.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Enough.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Stop talking nonsense.

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hurry up and book the ticket to the city.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mom,

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I haven't danced the square dance for days.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
My legs are tight.

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I love you so much, mom.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I love you too.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Mom.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This time,

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
we mainly came to

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
check

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
whether you are determined

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to take the test

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and take a vacation.

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Now that the task is completed,

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
your mom and I

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
will go back first.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But to be honest,

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wu Xi

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is really a good mountain,

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
a good water,

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and a good place to live.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's delicious even if you want to eat it.

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Peach blossom pastry.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll go get it.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Wu Xi.

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you, too.

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm so happy

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to see you.

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm so happy.

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm so happy.

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm so happy.

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you, too.

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Gu has taken us to play these two days.

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
After July,

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll have to trouble you to wait for me.

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's okay.

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Uncle and aunt,

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll help you

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
put your luggage in the car.

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Thank you.

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And the ginseng.

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's really hard for you

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
to stay with us in July

156
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and have a good time.

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
For a moment,

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I really thought my daughter

159
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
was getting married.

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let me do it.

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's okay, Gu.

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Since you've got the thing,

163
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
you should do it.

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Dad, mom,

165
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
take these peach blossom pastry

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and eat them.

167
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Tell me when you're done.

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll send them to you.

169
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Which one do you want?

170
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mom, what are you talking about?

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They're all my good friends.

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Forget it.

173
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You lied to me again.

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not lying.

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not lying.

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm not lying.

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm not lying.

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm not lying.

179
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're not lying to me.

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You didn't take me as your best friend.

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Stop talking.

182
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Just go.

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't catch the plane in a while.

184
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Baby, take good care of yourself.

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I know.

186
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Li Meizhen.

187
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm serious about what I said to you.

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's true that I like you.

189
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's true that I came to Wuxi for you.

190
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The ring is also true.

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Sun Peng.

192
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I know what I did yesterday

193
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
was indeed very rude.

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But if I don't tell you

195
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
what I said,

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll be very upset.

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sun Peng, you're so good.

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I've always treated you

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
as a good friend.

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm not lying.

201
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not lying.

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not lying.

203
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not lying.

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not lying.

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not lying.

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm not lying.

207
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm not lying.

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not lying.

209
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not lying.

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're my friend.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And actually,

212
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I...

213
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So Gu Ci'an

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
is the person in your heart.

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is that right?

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who is it?

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Go back to work.

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll see you out.

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll see you out.

220
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why are you so dry?

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Help me eat some noodles

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and ask you something.

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll think of something.

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Little President Gu,

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I swear to you.

226
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's all because I'm too outstanding

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that he's chasing me.

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I really didn't have a relationship

229
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when I was working.

230
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Assistant Zhu,

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
let me ask you.

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If

233
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,640
to fall in love with a girl.

234
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,760
Fine, I admit it.

235
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,880
I took the initiative.

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,160
But it's definitely not more than 10%.

237
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm not talking about you.

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm talking about

239
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,080
a friend of mine.

240
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,320
Thank you for taking me as a friend.

241
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,680
Don't think too much about it.

242
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm talking about a friend of mine.

243
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,080
He likes a girl.

244
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,720
But

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,840
he's only 49% sure that

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,520
that girl likes him.

247
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,640
Do you think

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
he should confess?

249
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,520
You scared me

250
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,120
with this.

251
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,320
It's not that complicated.

252
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,920
It's easy to test

253
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,360
whether a girl likes you or not.

254
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,920
There are two steps in total.

255
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,160
The first step.

256
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
You should remember

257
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
whether he likes you

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
or not.

259
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,800
Gu Ci'an, can you do me a favor?

260
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,760
Why are you helping me today?

261
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,800
It seems to be a lot of trouble.

262
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
That's right.

263
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,160
Red notes are for girlfriends.

264
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,600
Only the time

265
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
is the confirmation of a girl's love for a man.

266
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,640
Then the second step.

267
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,040
Find a chance to ask her out.

268
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,920
Tell her that you like her.

269
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,440
Ask her again

270
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,800
if she likes you or not.

271
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,960
That's too straightforward.

272
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,520
It's not a test.

273
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,080
It's not a test.

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
It's sincerity.

275
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,760
Sincerity is the best way to kill a girl.

276
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,080
The most annoying kind of girl.

277
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,520
She's flirty and clumsy.

278
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
She's a boy.

279
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,400
Eat the noodles. They're all cooked.

280
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,880
Clumsy.

281
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Clumsy.

282
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,040
All right, I won't eat the degrees.

283
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,720
Cartera's a loday.

284
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,160
If I did get a reason,

285
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
he also won't understand my duty.

286
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
He worried that although I shouldn't succeed,

287
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,360
he doesn't want to know my story.

288
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,880
It was time to realize

289
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,920
As long as the result is good,

290
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,720
there's nothing you can't forgive.

291
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,080
Hello,

292
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
Gu Li.

293
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,760
Take me to the company tomorrow.

294
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,480
It's time to make a deal.

295
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,800
In just a few days,

296
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,960
I can finally sit down quietly

297
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,520
and have a bowl of noodles.

298
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
It seems that you've been busy recently.

299
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,040
Didn't your regretter

300
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,400
help you solve the problem?

301
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,560
Why did you mention him all of a sudden?

302
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,040
Because I think this person

303
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,280
is nice to you.

304
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,960
What do you think of him?

305
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,160
I think he

306
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
is a good person.

307
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,320
What?

308
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm sorry.

310
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm sorry.

311
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm sorry.

317
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm sorry.

319
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I'm sorry.

320
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm sorry.

322
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm sorry.

324
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm sorry.

325
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm sorry.

326
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I'm sorry.

327
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm sorry.

328
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm sorry.

330
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm sorry.

331
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm sorry.

332
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I'm sorry.

334
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm sorry.

335
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm sorry.

336
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm sorry.

337
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I'm sorry.

339
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm sorry.

340
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm sorry.

341
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm sorry.

342
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm sorry.

343
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm sorry.

344
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
I'm sorry.

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm sorry.

347
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm sorry.

348
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm sorry.

349
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I'm sorry.

351
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm sorry.

352
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I'm sorry.

353
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm sorry.

354
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I'm sorry.

355
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm sorry.

356
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm sorry.

357
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm sorry.

358
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm sorry.

359
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm sorry.

363
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
I'm sorry.

365
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
I'm sorry.
