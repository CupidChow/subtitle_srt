1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
our love will be forever at each other's side.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wu Xie!

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm here!

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's so beautiful.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If there's a painting frame

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that can bring the scenery to life,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
it will be the new moon night of Wenzeng.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Isn't the new moon night a painting of rice cake?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Its full name is Wenzengte Wei Lian Rice Cake.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Maybe you've seen too many big cities.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's why it looks so different here.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You don't understand.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I've imagined this scenery countless times.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I imagined that I could be in such a beautiful city.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I want to be with my loved ones,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and open a homestay together.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We can live our own lives together.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But I chose the wrong place.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I chose the wrong lover.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you chose the wrong one, then choose again.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't want to be in the same situation

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
as you.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You should be more careful.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
By the way,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
why did you help me today?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What's wrong?

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
To help you get your memory back.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I should say that I helped you with a knife.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm a good staff here.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll find some good friends tomorrow

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and teach him a lesson.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I promise he won't open the door.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's a good idea.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come on.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll give you a good idea.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Go.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A delivery service without a factory.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Isn't this store

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the only one that our company wants?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's none of your business.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Do whatever I ask you to do.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm not experienced in negotiations.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How about this?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Tomorrow, let the people from our company's project department

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
come and talk.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then deduct your salary this month.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Half for the people from the project department.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Half for the business partner.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Look.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Look at you.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I know everything.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Leave it to me.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wait for good news.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You just turn around.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who do you think you are?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Zhe.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't even hold on

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to me.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You...

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Fine.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
From now on,

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
your store

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
will have no customers.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Who are you trying to scare?

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you dare to let my store

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
have no customers today,

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
do you believe it or not,

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll make you

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
can't get out of this door today.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You scared me.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do it.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Zhu, we're here.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Start digging from here.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
From here.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Dig all the way here.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I understand.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What do you mean?

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The drain line in front of your house

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
has reached the year line.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It must be replaced immediately.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How can I do business

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
if you dig like this?

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The period is coming.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you don't dig,

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it will affect the people's legs, right?

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If it really causes a major loss

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
to the original area,

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it will be a failure.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come on.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Start digging.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Good.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Is it this high?

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Stop.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Brother.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go in and talk.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's talk.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to fight back with a few broken furniture.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I want to take away everything that is mine.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The carving on the outer wall

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is a picture I drew myself.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want to knock it away.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And the design of the door.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I spent two weeks to be satisfied.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I have to carry it back.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't hit it.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll pay you back.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've thought about it.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll pay you back.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll pay you back.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll pay you back.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll pay you back.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll pay you back.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've thought about it.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you keep making trouble every day,

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
my homestay can't be opened at all.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
At least we can have a blind date.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't mention this to me.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's disgusting.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Rather than two losses,

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
it's better to save one.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We can have a relationship.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How about this?

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I only want 500,000.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Give me 500,000.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll do it now.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
500,000?

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You have 500,000

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
in your whole life.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Can you be more civilized?

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm doing this for you.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You paid the renovation fee for the door.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You paid the rent.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But the rent was paid by Meng Tian.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is the biggest effort I've made.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll give you 10,000 at most.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Are you sincere?

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
450,000.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then 40,000.

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The number is more suitable for you.

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
40,000 is more suitable.

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't go too far.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll give you another 40,000.

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
40,000.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
40,000.

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Give me a total.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
100,000.

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is my last money.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
OK.

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
100,000.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll transfer the money now.

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll leave right away.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Qi Yue, are you crazy?

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He used your money

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to open a homestay with another woman.

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now you have to spend 100,000 to buy it back.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You have this money.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why don't you think about it first?

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Duo Duo, no matter how much you have,

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you transfer me first.

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll explain to you later.

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I really borrowed everything I could.

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have the money.

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I just gave the compensation.

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was going to take this money

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and go out to play.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Cool.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who let me have a best friend like you?

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Qi Yue,

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
have you really thought it through?

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This homestay is your heart.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's not do it.

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Open another one, OK?

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No.

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I want this one.

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is my hard work for many years.

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
OK.

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm really convinced of you.

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Transfer it right away.

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You received the money, right?

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can go now.

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm leaving.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Qi Yue.

191
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Go away.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My homestay.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're finally back.

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Last hour.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The world is like a wheel of fortune.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Even if you go through the lowest of hardships,

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the sky will always be full of you.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Come on.

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You also have to have the courage to take the initiative to fight for the opportunity.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This city will definitely give you good results.

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It makes sense.

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
A optimistic attitude

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
plus an unwavering confidence

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
is equal to being strong.

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The golden lake

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
brings the fire of July

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and the fragrance of the sky

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Time is silent

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
but it remembers the memories

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and leaves no traces

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
of you under the peach tree

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The wind of July is sweet

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and the four seasons are interlocked

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There is no word that can describe you

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Even if it is a mountain of mountains

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will follow your footsteps

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Just like the wind and the rain

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Even if it is a mountain of mountains

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I will follow your footsteps

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Just like the wind and the rain

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The wind and the rain
