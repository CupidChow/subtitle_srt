1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
our love

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is right beside each other.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 18

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,600
Hello, sir.

5
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Do you have a reservation?

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Zhao Yunyi booked a room.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, let me check.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Zhao Yunyi

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Zhao Yunyi

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yunyi is here for the video.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yunyi

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yunyi

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We just arrived.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We are in the middle of the night.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have to get ready.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Have you had your meals?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have ordered take-out for you.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No, no.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am not hungry.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We have eaten a lot.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Good boy.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You should have a rest.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I have arranged the schedule for tomorrow.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will send it to your family.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, okay.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I won't talk about it.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Your room is ready.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Room 203 on the second floor.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The big bedroom.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Go up and turn left.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Miss

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Can you change the romantic big bedroom

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
into a standard room?

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The romantic theme room you booked

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
is on the Internet.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The standard room will be more expensive.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Our big bedroom has a very good view.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It also has a light and double bathtub.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is the standard room.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The kind of room where two beds are separated.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, yes.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The price is the same.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will check it for you.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please wait a moment.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Have a rest.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Call me if you need anything.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, thank you.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Bye.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's so strange.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This couple is very polite and well-mannered.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But from the beginning to the end,

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
they didn't say a word.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's like they have a grudge.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you think

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
they are not a real couple?

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then what are they?

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Or

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
they are the high-class special forces

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
disguised as a couple.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't scare him.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They are a real couple.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Their daughters are all real.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They are not a couple.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They are not a couple.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They are not a couple.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They are a real couple.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Their daughters are all WeChat.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They even sent me several messages.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Listen.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hello, sorry to bother you.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I am the daughter of the couple in the house.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I need your help.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Please help me see

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
how they are in real status.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I grew up in a happy family.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The relationship between parents is very harmonious.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But I always feel that

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
they have something to hide from me.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sometimes I go home after school.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I see them

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
signing some kind of agreement.

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want to see

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
why mom wants to drive me away.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I started to live in the school in high school.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Every weekend, I go home,

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I find that

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
dad sleeps in the living room at night.

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I find that

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
in their bedroom,

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
there are almost all of mom's things.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So after the college entrance examination,

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I decided to

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
book this trip for them.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I really want to know

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
what's wrong with them.

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Look at this.

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I have a good card.

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I have a 3.

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you think

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
this question

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
will appear on this 3?

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think this thing

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
has nothing to do with 3.

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Shut up.

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I think

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
this thing

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
has nothing to do with 3.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why are you so bold?

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You should let me go.

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You don't have any tacit understanding.

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We haven't won

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
a single game.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
fight with Duo Duo.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You think I don't want to?

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not up to me.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't want to fight with you.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So some things

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
are not decided by us

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
from the beginning.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Since you have made a choice,

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you should just go ahead.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you need any help?

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Can you open another store for me?

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sorry, sir.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Our room is full.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sir.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Sir.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's so late.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where is he going?

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't want him to go.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So I lied to him that there was no room.

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I didn't expect him to go.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How can I tell his daughter?

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Gu Ci'an,

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you have to find a way.

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll go out and get him back.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Duo Duo, what should we do?

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Call him.

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Call his daughter.

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hello, Zhu Gu Li.

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Go and arrange it.

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What are you doing?

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I...

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I called his daughter

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and asked her to call his father back.

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's almost 12 o'clock.

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How much are you worried about him now?

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What do you think we should do?

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's a three-day trip.

154
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They broke up on the first night.

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I wanted to play a trick.

156
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I didn't expect to make it work.

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't worry.

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In an hour,

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
he will definitely come back.

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you sure?

161
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
When did I lie to you?

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You two go to rest first.

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll wait here.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So handsome.

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Duo Duo, let's go.

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hello, Zhu Gu Li.

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How did you do this?

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
All the hotels in the five kilometers

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
of the Qimeng District

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
have been notified

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
of the arrival of the president

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and the arrival of the upper and lower part

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
of the 50-yuan hotel.

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I got it.

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He's back.

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Brother,

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
we've been waiting for you.

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You should drink.

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll go to rest.

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll go to rest.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've been waiting for you.

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You should drink.

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Brother,

185
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
my daughter is getting married.

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I should drink to celebrate.

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, you should.

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Brother, I'll take you to your room.

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You should drink with me.

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
More?

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes, you're familiar with this area.

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's find a place to drink.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Brother.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Brother,

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm calling you to drink with me.

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm not asking you to drink.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You should drink some noodle soup

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
to relieve your hangover.

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I didn't drink too much.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Kun Shan Ouzhao Noodles

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is fresh and warm.

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You can drink it like this.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It can relieve hangover

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and nourish your stomach.

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Really?

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm really looking for the wrong person.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
To be honest,

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I just want to try

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the delicious food in Wuxi

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and see the scenery of Huishan.

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't worry.

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go back to your room.

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Have a good rest.

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll give you and your aunt

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
a double-edged sword in the afternoon.

216
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What's wrong?

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I've discussed with Kai.

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll go out on the first day.

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He'll rest in the hotel.

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll rest when he goes out on the second day.

221
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why don't you go out together?

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Going out together

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
is not a fight.

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not happy.

225
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's been so many years.

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's all the past.

227
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Eat it.

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Congratulations, aunt.

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yiyi got into the 985.

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a good thing.

231
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've completed

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
my mission with her dad.

234
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a pity that uncle is not here.

235
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Otherwise, we can celebrate at noon.

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't.

237
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
She celebrates her.

238
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I celebrate mine.

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's good to be together without disturbing each other.

240
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The landowner.

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why are these three cards so bad?

242
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's no way.

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's the rule.

244
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Since you've chosen,

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you can't go back on your words.

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'd rather be a farmer.

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
With these three cards,

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know how to get them.

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How can I get them?

250
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Just make a mistake.

251
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hurry up.

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Aunt, I have a message.

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

254
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What's wrong?

255
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yiyi said today is your and uncle's

256
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
wedding anniversary.

257
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Really?

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We've been together for a long time.

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yiyi said she wanted to give you a surprise.

260
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
She's off the plane.

261
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What?

262
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are you playing?

263
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's get her dad back.

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The two suitable people

265
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
are like sugar in a wuxi xiaolong bag.

266
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It sounds incredible.

267
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In fact, it's very sweet and delicious.

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If the two people who are not suitable are together,

269
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
will it be like winter dates with bananas?

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They are all delicious.

271
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Eating together is a smell.

272
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
These two foods won't be together.

273
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Maybe they will appear in the fruit plate.

274
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
To make it look good.

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This winter date can be replaced with apples.

276
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

277
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Bananas can also be replaced with star anise.

278
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The wind blows in the wind

279
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The sky is full of fragrance

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Time is silent

281
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But remember the memories

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't leave a trace

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The secret under the peach tree

284
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The wind in July is sweet

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The four seasons are over

286
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No word can describe

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Even in the mountains and mountains

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I have to pursue your path

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Just like the wind and the rain

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Even in the mountains and mountains

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I have to pursue your path

292
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Just like the wind and the rain
