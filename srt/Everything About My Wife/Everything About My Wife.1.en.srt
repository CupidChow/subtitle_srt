1
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,548
<i>I used to think</i>

2
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,717
<i>that love was simple.</i>

3
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,971
<i>Living with someone's best qualities</i>

4
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,226
<i>also means accepting their faults.</i>

5
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:45,063
- Young-soo!
- Young-soo!

6
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,658
- Young-soo!
- Young-soo!

7
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,203
- Young-soo!
- Young-soo!

8
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,626
- Young-soo!
- Young-soo!

9
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,128
Excuse me.

10
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,341
It's me, this is your wifey!

11
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,350
- Young-soo!
- Young-soo!

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,149
You don't have to try so hard, girl.

13
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,442
Whatever!

14
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,278
May the best fan win!

15
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,532
MARRY ME, YOUNG-SOO. I LOVE YOU.

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,753
- Hurry up! Take this!
- Sir, what happened?

17
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,813
Are you okay?

18
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,649
- Do I look okay?
- Relax!

19
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,526
You're not going to die!

20
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,945
How sure are you?

21
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,280
Well…

22
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,374
<i>Let the world fall away</i>

23
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,628
<i>and leave only the reasons</i>

24
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,588
<i>why you fell in love with her.</i>

25
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,091
<i>And of all the people in the world,</i>

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,845
<i>it's her you want to see every day.</i>

27
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,100
Is anybody hurt?

28
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,894
- Are you all okay?
- Earthquake!

29
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,149
- Is everyone fine?
- Where's my love?

30
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,986
Everything's all right, miss.

31
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,155
- All right?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,198
All right…

33
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,243
Is the earthquake over?

34
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,411
It's gone.

35
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,247
It flew away. Whoosh!

36
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,709
- Just stand by. We're leaving.
- Young-soo!

37
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,839
Young-soo!

38
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,099
<i>Why are you smiling at me?</i>

39
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,858
No, I just wanted to say you're welcome.

40
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,987
Oh, I'm sorry!

41
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,322
Thank you for earlier.

42
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,621
Imogen Karuhatan.

43
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,291
Imo.

44
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,589
Dominic Brizuela.

45
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,841
Dom.

46
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,510
Dom.

47
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,310
I have a feeling

48
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,104
that the earthquake
wasn't the real act of God.

49
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,816
What then?

50
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,027
It's this one.

51
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,154
We've met.

52
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,493
By the way, I got myself a new name!

53
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,204
It's now Im-a Flirt!

54
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,458
<i>It's easy to fall for someone</i>
<i>with a sense of humor.</i>

55
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,126
<i>Someone fun to be with.</i>

56
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,462
<i>It makes you want to know her more</i>

57
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,339
- <i>and be with her.</i>
- Try this Tuslob Buwa.

58
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,258
It's a Cebu specialty.

59
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,926
It's made from pig brains.

60
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,386
Really? Let's see.

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,471
Here.

62
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,185
Are you sure it's good?

63
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,533
No wonder it's good.

64
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,910
It's from Cebu.

65
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,913
You--

66
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,714
Want some? Here.

67
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,174
Try it.

68
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,176
I want some.

69
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,470
I want it so badly.

70
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,352
That's one way to make a move!

71
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,812
And because of that…

72
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,068
you can have my Puso.

73
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,370
Watch your cards closely!

74
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,622
Be ready to shout "Bingo"!

75
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,833
Do we have any winners?

76
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,917
Let's find out!

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,168
Our letter is…

78
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,422
O!

79
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,924
The Bald One!

80
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,509
It's you! You're the bald one!

81
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,887
Well, you're getting there.

82
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,180
What about

83
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,975
three kids?

84
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,310
What are you, a sissy? Only three?

85
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,356
Well, how many do you want?

86
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,108
How many can you give me?

87
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,402
Under the letter B!

88
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,989
For all the gossip out there!

89
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,491
Seven!

90
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,663
Really?

91
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,707
What? 100,000?

92
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,042
<i>- One hundred thousand!</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

93
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,454
<i>It feels good</i>
<i>to have someone choose you every day</i>

94
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:21,209
<i>over so many other people.</i>

95
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,805
Give us the right fare!

96
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,975
- Give it to us!
- Really? Now, of all times?

97
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,686
- Babe, protests are important.
- Lower oil prices!

98
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,606
If Bonifacio and Rizal hadn't protested,

99
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,651
you would have been
a boy-toy for the Spaniards.

100
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,489
You're really cute, you know?

101
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,616
Let's go then.

102
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,243
- Give it to us!
- Give it to us!

103
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,954
- We support the jeepney drivers!
- Lower oil prices!

104
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,997
- We must stand up for our livelihood!
- Right!

105
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,292
- Yes, fight for what's right!
- The price of oil.

106
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,086
- Needs to go down!
- Needs to go down!

107
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,588
- Wow!
- Give us the right fare!

108
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,298
Give it to us!

109
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,467
The price of oil!

110
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,177
- Needs to go down!
- Needs to go down!

111
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,304
Give us the right fare!

112
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,973
- Give it to us!
- Give it to us!

113
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,685
Imogen Karuhatan.

114
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,317
- The price of oil!
- Needs to go down!

115
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,862
- Give us the right fare!
- Give it to us!

116
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,824
Wait, hold on!

117
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,950
Don't move!

118
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,787
- Sir, can I borrow this?
- Sure, ma'am.

119
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,415
Thank you, sir!

120
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,459
Give us the right fare!

121
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:58,097
<i>But what caught me off guard is that</i>
<i>sometimes as time passes,</i>

122
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,142
<i>the qualities that</i>
<i>made you fall for someone</i>

123
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,937
<i>are the same qualities</i>
<i>you'd begin to hate.</i>

124
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,319
<i>And when you get fed up with everything,</i>

125
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,364
<i>you sometimes ask,</i>
<i>"What if I just give up on us?"</i>

126
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,623
<i>Dom!</i>

127
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,430
<i>It looks like you're ready in case.</i>
<i>We get another pandemic!</i>

128
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,247
Imo!

129
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,666
- Do that later!
- What?

130
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,917
Do that later!

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,752
- I can't hear you!
- Do that later!

132
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,004
Oh! Do it later?

133
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,265
Why do you have to do that now?
I'm in a meeting!

134
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,684
If you cleaned up your mess,
I wouldn't have to!

135
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,770
- That wasn't mine!
- Fine, it's mine then.

136
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,494
Why now?

137
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,087
Looks like we're done here.

138
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,090
What do you think you're doing?

139
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,050
Why are you cutting our power?

140
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,552
Babe, calm down.

141
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,721
You're scheduled for disconnection today.

142
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,639
But we've settled the bill!

143
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,725
- When did you make your payment, ma'am?
- An hour ago, actually!

144
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,561
- There you have it.
- What? You just paid it today?

145
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,272
In that case, ma'am, you should've paid it
in person at the office. Right, sir?

146
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,565
Can't you look it up on your system

147
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,983
and see that we've paid?

148
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,069
This is a grave injustice!

149
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,279
Injustice?

150
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,364
Stay out of this.

151
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,283
Reconnect us! Right now!

152
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,577
Don't worry. You'll get reconnected soon.

153
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,328
Give it around 24 hours.

154
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,872
It'll be back before you know it.
Go on, get it.

155
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,166
- Wait! What do you mean?
- Let's go.

156
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,083
No power for an entire day?

157
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,960
- I'm hungry. Let's go.
- This is insane!

158
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,880
To avoid any further issues,
please remember to pay on time.

159
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,257
- Thank you and goodbye, ma'am.
- Hey!

160
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,843
What are you--
Does that look like a toilet to you?

161
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,386
- Come on.
- No--

162
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,846
Get in. Come on.

163
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,182
Don't they know that the chances of fire

164
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,809
in most households increase
when the power is out?

165
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,686
Or when the power is cut.

166
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,730
You had all month to pay the bill.

167
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,064
I was busy.

168
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,609
Right, you were busy.

169
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,083
Can I at least finish?

170
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,627
I'm busy, too.

171
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,254
You just don't seem to notice.

172
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,965
Not to hold anything against you,

173
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,218
but we've already talked about this.

174
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,262
I'll take care of the house,
and you build up your career

175
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,473
while I figure out what I want to do.

176
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,766
Where are you going?

177
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,935
Where else? At the laundry shop!

178
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,311
Since I'm the one
who doesn't have a career,

179
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm the one who needs to do our laundry.

180
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,316
Not to mention
every other errand for the house.

181
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,319
Of course, I can't complain.

182
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,946
I have to be happy

183
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,907
and content with where I am right now.

184
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,992
Unless you don't like it.

185
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,079
We can switch places.

186
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,873
I'll be starting my career from scratch.

187
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,792
Does that sound good to you?

188
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,628
Hey. Answer me.

189
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,672
What do you say?

190
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,134
I've had enough!

191
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,479
You're done?

192
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,067
You're done with me?

193
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,862
No!

194
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,905
I was joking.

195
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,450
Really? You're joking?

196
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,953
Do you think I have it easy?

197
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,580
Do you think this is funny?

198
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,120
You're unbelievable!

199
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,788
What you said yesterday?

200
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,041
It just started sinking in.

201
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,550
Right when I was naked!

202
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,552
When I was most vulnerable!

203
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,721
That's when you tell me you've had enough?

204
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,443
I can't explain why.

205
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,779
I'm sad all the time.

206
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,614
I'm not happy at all, Dom!

207
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,289
It might be an emergency.

208
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,670
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

209
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,297
<i>Being at home is driving me insane!</i>

210
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,507
<i>Dom--</i>

211
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,136
Is Imo okay?

212
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,263
It's actually just foreplay.

213
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,947
But who's going to Cebu
to oversee the project?

214
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,198
Me, sir!

215
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,283
I've always wanted to relocate to Cebu.

216
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,496
Sir! Dom has a counter-proposal.

217
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,002
I'd like

218
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,712
to oversee my own design, sir.

219
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,255
Come on, man.

220
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,756
My wife just left me.

221
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,550
She left me alone in Manila.

222
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,135
Bro, I think

223
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,637
you shouldn't give up on her that easy.

224
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,307
You should listen to Dom.

225
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,398
Fine! Dom and Arnold
are coming with me to Cebu.

226
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,233
Just let Dom have this one, man.

227
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,777
You never know, he might finally
get Imo pregnant there.

228
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,862
Boss, wait!

229
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,071
Next time, bro.

230
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,118
We got it!

231
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,495
I'm not taking Imo with me.

232
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,875
- All I want--
- Here's your order.

233
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,793
All I'm asking for

234
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,254
is a bit of peace!

235
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,465
Imo's toxic now, isn't she?

236
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,842
Just admit it, man.

237
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,927
You can't stand your wife

238
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,431
and that's why
you're looking for some space!

239
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,142
Cebu isn't about overseeing your design.

240
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,310
It's about her.

241
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,770
I don't know what to do.

242
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,147
Just admit it to yourself!

243
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,691
You want to separate from her.

244
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,615
I don't know.

245
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,326
Which means yes!

246
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,911
You want to leave.

247
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,122
The problem is you can't find a reason.

248
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,875
But there must be one.

249
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,418
Hold on, man.

250
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,045
Do you have a reason to leave?

251
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,671
Actually, there isn't!

252
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm not cheating on her.

253
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,260
She isn't cheating on me!

254
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,553
Damn it!

255
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,181
That part's easy!

256
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,643
Let's get Imo another man!

257
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,147
We're getting Imo another man!

258
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,740
Cebu?

259
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,284
What are you doing in Cebu?

260
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,869
It'll only be for six months, babe.

261
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,998
It's a great opportunity
to spend time with my mom.

262
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,376
She's not getting any younger.

263
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,920
And then what'll she say?

264
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,132
"Good that you didn't bring
your wife here."

265
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,217
Babe, you don't have to think about her.

266
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,010
Think about this instead.

267
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,974
You get to do everything you want
while I'm away!

268
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,692
Can I go?

269
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,089
What are you doing here?

270
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,302
Mr. Macatangay let me tag along.

271
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,054
But

272
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,764
what about our house?

273
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,891
It's still standing.

274
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,601
What about your plants?

275
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,520
Who's taking care of them?

276
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,272
I left them to the neighbor.

277
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,529
Doesn't this seem smaller than our house?

278
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,906
Why don't you ask your boss
for something else?

279
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,325
Ask him to have us moved to a bigger unit.

280
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,827
Did you see the trash out front?

281
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,036
It's all on the street.

282
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,496
It's everywhere!

283
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,248
I'm reporting it first thing tomorrow.

284
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,167
Oh my God, and
the Internet connection! It's so slow!

285
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,129
Do we even have cable?
Why are there so few channels?

286
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,881
And the signal's unstable.
And what's wrong with the remote?

287
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,344
Hey, babe!

288
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,098
What's wrong? Did you hear me?

289
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,182
Are you okay?

290
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,434
I said

291
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,770
do you want me
to ask your boss to have us moved?

292
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,983
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

293
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,456
You've got some nerve!

294
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,833
To think that Miguel would fall for you?

295
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,669
I'm his girlfriend, not you!

296
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,921
This guy better be handsome, or else.

297
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,008
If you're the girlfriend,
then why does he come to me every night?

298
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,969
Is that why he moans louder
when he's with me?

299
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,558
But it looks like
he's having a seizure when he's with me.

300
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,976
Oh really?

301
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,395
How about I give you a seizure for real?

302
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,087
- Are you guys fighting?
- Baby!

303
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,256
- It's her fault.
- Acting like she's the only pretty one.

304
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,717
Not really. You have great skin, girl.

305
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,969
Your skin's pretty nice too!

306
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,387
I'm so pretty. Come here.

307
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,722
Smooth!

308
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,034
Hey!

309
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,161
Fuckboy!

310
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,372
Yes, you on the roof!

311
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,961
Get down from there or you'll fall!

312
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,587
I'm fine with falling.

313
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,841
It would end my suffering.

314
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,092
What are you? An idiot?

315
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,677
You won't die from this height!

316
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,679
You'll only cripple yourself.

317
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,514
Well, I've had enough of living.

318
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,975
Hey!

319
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,185
Hey!

320
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,525
Don't jump from there!

321
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,484
You idiot!

322
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,028
I'm going to call for help! I'll be back!

323
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,572
Stay right there!

324
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,699
Stay right there, okay?

325
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,702
Stay right there!

326
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,038
What's the problem, ma'am?

327
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,874
This idiot is the problem!

328
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,458
Inconsiderate prick!

329
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,045
Imagine if he got himself killed!

330
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,257
I don't want a ghost haunting me
every time I pass by that house.

331
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,182
See, ma'am?

332
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,309
He said he was sorry.

333
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,102
Do you have a problem with that?

334
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
It's just right that he'd be sorry!

335
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,772
Well, he should be sorry!

336
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,816
He should be in prison for what he did!

337
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,068
You? In prison?

338
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,530
On what charges?

339
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,617
Well…

340
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,452
What? Spit it out!

341
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,454
What?

342
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,295
I didn't do anything to you.

343
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,261
Mental harassment? Really?

344
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,935
He says he didn't do it!

345
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,606
What happened?

346
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,690
What's going on?

347
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,817
She talks too much.

348
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,612
I just want to teach
this fuckboy a lesson.

349
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,866
Please forgive my wife.

350
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,620
Just let him be. He's going through a lot.

351
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,372
But he doesn't have
to involve other people!

352
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,833
We're new around here.

353
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,710
You can't go around picking fights.

354
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,338
I wouldn't be here
if he didn't do anything wrong!

355
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,965
All right,

356
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,008
but lower your voice.

357
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,011
How low? Like this?

358
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,556
Come on.

359
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,892
Let's talk about this at home.

360
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,982
- No! I'll go first!
- Captain.

361
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,985
- Baby Miguel!
- Baby!

362
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,529
Miguel!

363
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,031
- It's me.
- No, it's me, Captain.

364
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,908
Calm down, both of you!

365
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,076
Why?

366
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,898
Come on, let's go.

367
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,241
Yes. You're the one

368
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,535
with the interesting wife.

369
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,998
That's me.

370
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,835
One of the girls
outside your house mentioned that

371
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,421
I could find you here.

372
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,302
Cool.

373
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,849
I just came by

374
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,684
to apologize.

375
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,062
For what my wife did.

376
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,815
So, let me make it up to you.

377
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:39,991
Cheche?

378
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,284
- Yes, sir?
- Two beers.

379
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,452
Okay, sir.

380
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,394
That!

381
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,730
That's what all guys dream of!

382
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,941
Not every guy.

383
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,902
Sometimes, I just want

384
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,865
to come home to the right woman for me.

385
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,582
Is it really that hard?

386
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,128
Finding the right woman?

387
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,047
Actually,

388
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,591
not for you.

389
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:43,304
You're lucky to have a reason to go home.

390
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,807
You mean my house?

391
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,184
My house?

392
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,310
Oh, my--

393
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,158
I don't.

394
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,745
But I know this.

395
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,331
She's perfect for you.

396
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,897
Come on, man.

397
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,107
If you're lucky enough

398
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,319
to find the right woman for you,

399
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,239
you should never let her go.

400
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:55,084
Come on. Who wouldn't have a crush on her?

401
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,259
Is that a challenge?

402
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,474
Intense.

403
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,477
Fine, give it a shot!

404
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,023
You couldn't handle Imo.

405
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,443
And what if

406
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,821
I can handle her?

407
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,073
That's my wife, you asshole!

408
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,327
If I took you up on that,

409
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,832
she'd leave you, for me.

410
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,917
That's no threat.

411
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,127
That's a promise.

412
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,422
Fine!

413
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,757
Try it!

414
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,272
There's my brother!

415
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,399
Hey!

416
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,278
Have you eaten yet?

417
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,905
I'm fine. I have to go soon.

418
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,782
I just had to get away from Mom.

419
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,577
She keeps going on about
when I'll ever graduate.

420
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,870
Can you blame her?

421
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,997
You've been at San Carlos for seven years.

422
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,790
I've had enough of school.

423
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,750
"I've had enough of school."

424
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,471
As long as you've got the…

425
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,267
All right, fine!

426
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,649
This is <i>Hey, Wakey-wakey</i>!

427
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,444
Remember, while no one complains,

428
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,821
nothing can change!

429
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,538
Today, we're fortunate
to have a new co-host!

430
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,707
Your sis, my sis!

431
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,460
Sis Imo!

432
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,214
I'd like to wish everyone a nice day,

433
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,341
but it's not.

434
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,383
Right!

435
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,929
It's Carmageddon today.

436
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,640
This is what
our fellow commuters have to deal with.

437
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,768
Imagine heavy traffic
so early in the morning!

438
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,146
There's a simple solution
to our traffic problems in this country!

439
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,065
Cut down on private vehicles

440
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,108
and fix mass transportation.

441
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:29,113
<i>The thing is, we have very poor</i>
<i>mass transportation in the country.</i>

442
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,992
<i>Well, that means traffic during rush hour</i>
<i>will always be our problem.</i>

443
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,953
<i>- Everybody knows this!</i>
- Right!

444
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,330
<i>But they still choose to buy a car!</i>

445
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,791
<i>Owning a car as a private citizen</i>

446
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,502
<i>comes with a certain responsibility.</i>

447
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,420
I think she means you, boss.

448
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,756
Mind your own responsibilities, Arnold!

449
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,466
So if you're going out alone

450
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,176
and it's not that far?

451
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,178
Well, for god's sake!

452
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,931
Leave your car at home and just commute!

453
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,766
Who are these people, Sis Imo?

454
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,226
I don't want to drop names.

455
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,561
But my husband's one of them!

456
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,356
I knew it!

457
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,358
Oh, Dom.

458
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,985
<i>Don't act surprised.</i>

459
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,029
There are plenty
of other modes of transportation.

460
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,032
There's the bus, the jeepney or the train!

461
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,702
<i>And if you have one, ride a bicycle!</i>

462
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,454
<i>Well, the weather is a bit too hot</i>
<i>for a commute, you know.</i>

463
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,664
<i>What about heatstroke?</i>

464
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,750
<i>Taking a car would only make it worse!</i>

465
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,419
This girl is unbelievable!

466
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,088
She speaks with no class at all!

467
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,631
She gets on my nerves!

468
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,884
Your daughter-in-law only takes after you.

469
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,511
Don't be so loud!

470
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,763
You'd better watch your mouth.

471
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,892
Unless you want me
to shove this piece into your throat!

472
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,271
Get that out of my sight.

473
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,690
I don't want to hear
what that Imo has to say.

474
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,860
And those people who complain
about the bike lanes.

475
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,321
They should be grateful
to everyone who rides their bicycles!

476
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,408
<i>Less cars,</i>
<i>less carbon emissions in our air!</i>

477
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,288
<i>They're a big help to Mother Nature!</i>

478
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,622
<i>Right?</i>

479
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,001
<i>And since we can't afford hybrid cars,</i>

480
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,295
<i>why don't we just focus</i>
<i>on eco-friendly living?</i>

481
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,379
<i>Simple!</i>

482
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,923
I guess that explains Dom's complexion.

483
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:15,261
He's never gotten a sunburn
in his fancy gas-powered car.

484
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,516
Boss, his skin is as light as his groin.

485
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,923
What's wrong with your wife?

486
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,009
Saying all kinds of things in public.

487
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,928
What an embarrassment.

488
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,306
I've never liked that woman.

489
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,307
Damn it.

490
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,934
Calm down, Ma.

491
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,560
I'll talk to her.

492
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,479
As you should.

493
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,939
It's your responsibility.

494
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,941
You're the man in this relationship.

495
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,235
<i>You'd better control that Imo--</i>

496
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,615
So?

497
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,908
Is it still on?

498
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,871
Is what still on?

499
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,458
When we went drinking, you told me
I could have a shot with your wife.

500
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,923
Did I say that?

501
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,342
You don't remember?

502
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,555
I'd never say something like that.

503
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,183
You told me that
you want your wife to leave you.

504
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,243
You want my wife to leave me?

505
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,580
No, you want your wife to leave you.

506
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,582
I want my wife to leave me?

507
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,916
That's what you said.

508
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,585
Wait a minute.

509
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,549
This is insane.

510
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,899
What do I have to do?

511
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:49,290
<i>Imo is a sucker for K-Pop and K-Dramas.</i>

512
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:59,217
<i>She is into anything Korean.</i>

513
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,474
<i>She likes everything neat.</i>

514
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,017
<i>She likes music.</i>

515
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,105
<i>She likes to read in her free time.</i>

516
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,401
<i>She also likes scented candles.</i>

517
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,992
No sex.

518
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,914
Fine.

519
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,040
I can do that.

520
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,919
Unless she wants it.

521
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,422
How many times do I have to say, no sex?

522
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,722
As long as you're ready

523
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,976
for her to leave you.

524
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,878
She's here, boss.

525
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,338
Good.

526
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,673
Get ready.

527
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,812
Gong Yoo?

528
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,411
You wouldn't want to get wet.

529
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,854
What's so funny?

530
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,815
I've seen this show, dummy.

531
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,569
It's <i>Goblin</i>.

532
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,196
- Right?
- What?

533
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,618
Wow.

534
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,996
You really got the Gong Yoo look down.

535
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,666
I have a crush on him.

536
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,672
It's uncanny.

537
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,174
Does that mean

538
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,301
you have a crush on me, too?

539
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,720
You shouldn't, though. You're married.

540
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,888
Oh, my.

541
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,308
Aren't you too confident?

542
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,437
Actually, I did this on purpose.

543
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,858
I want to apologize for what happened.

544
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,111
That's okay.

545
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,030
Just don't do it again.

546
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,574
I probably won't.

547
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,534
Because you're already here.

548
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,958
If you do that again,

549
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,626
I'll throw you off that roof myself.

550
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,919
Believe me.

551
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,338
See you later.

552
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,215
You have a beautiful laugh.

553
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,725
Oh, cut it off.

554
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,810
You're so silly.

555
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,105
All right.

556
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,197
Oh. What about your assistant?

557
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,616
Is she going to be okay up there?

558
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,201
She can come down now.

559
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,745
All right.

560
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,079
All right.

561
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,975
LOOKING FOR SCENTED CANDLES
TO GET RID OF THE BAD SMELL IN THE HOUSE

562
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,102
I HAVE A LOT OF CANDLES HERE.
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME.

563
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,903
How's it going?

564
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,865
She's responding to my advances.

565
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,034
Wait.

566
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,411
How do you know that?

567
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,915
I can see it in her eyes.

568
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,833
So?

569
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,168
How is she at home?

570
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,129
Just normal.

571
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,382
The usual.

572
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,260
Have you noticed anything strange?

573
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,970
<i>Strange?</i>

574
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,392
She seems to be going crazy.

575
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,856
<i>I mean crazy.</i>

576
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,403
<i>Sometimes, I catch her laughing</i>
<i>to herself like some kind of villain.</i>

577
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,111
About that candle…

578
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,801
So, you're an adventurer.

579
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,596
You have a very active lifestyle.

580
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,973
I used to like a lot of things.

581
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,184
But then it all stopped…

582
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,979
when I lost Melissa.

583
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,776
Your wife?

584
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,487
What happened to her?

585
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,031
She's gone.

586
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,199
She died.

587
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,161
That's okay.

588
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,793
Anyways…

589
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,673
If you see a scented candle you like,
it's yours.

590
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,467
Oh, no. That's okay.

591
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,011
They're too precious to give away.

592
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,688
Look, I want to give this to you…

593
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,779
because I want to make sure
that it goes to someone special.

594
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,158
Take it.

595
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,916
All of these records
were Melissa's favorites.

596
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,211
We even had a song for each activity.

597
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,422
Like this one.

598
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,967
It's for cooking.

599
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,553
This one's for the laundry.

600
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,680
And this is…

601
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,601
for when we make love.

602
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,875
Oh, no.

603
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,670
I'm not sure
we should be dancing like this.

604
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,926
You're married.

605
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,137
That's why I can be vulnerable with you

606
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,390
because I know you won't fall for me.

607
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,435
Absolutely.

608
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,580
You know,

609
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,417
if you're falling for me,

610
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,420
that's okay.

611
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,839
I don't believe in marriages.

612
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,642
And if you ever want to explore,

613
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,520
we're always open

614
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,064
at the Pussy Cafe.

615
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,612
Well,

616
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,698
I'll be going now.

617
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,408
Okay. I'll walk you back.

618
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,534
No, that's okay.

619
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,578
My husband, we…

620
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,498
We're going to have sex.

621
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,833
What?

622
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,847
Thanks for the candle.

623
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,016
Bye.

624
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,149
Great show.

625
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,569
Is it true that
our hits have been going up?

626
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,864
Yes. Actually, one of our older episodes

627
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:32,492
just hit a million views.

628
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,871
We're famous!

629
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,664
You're getting more popular, Sis Imo.

630
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,750
You're the darling of <i>Hey, Wakey-wakey</i>.

631
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,251
Stop. It's a team effort.

632
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,878
Would you treat us to some food then?

633
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,796
Let's celebrate your first paycheck.

634
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,758
I'm sorry, I have to get home.
I'll make it up to you guys instead.

635
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,427
It's not like we're forcing you, Ms. Imo.
It's fine if you don't want to.

636
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,553
You idiot.

637
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,139
Do you and Dom have plans tonight?

638
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,394
All right, I'll be going now.

639
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,521
Bye. Congratulations.

640
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,716
- Sir.
- See you tomorrow, sir.

641
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,926
All right. See you guys.

642
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,135
Take care.

643
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:43,313
I'M GLAD YOU AGREED TO COME

644
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,893
Imo?

645
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,066
I like you.

646
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,198
But…

647
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,159
I just want to say it. Okay?

648
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,625
I'm just happy to be with you.

649
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,296
Thank you.

650
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,398
- What's wrong?
- Sorry. I'll be right back.

651
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,692
- I'll be quick. Stay here.
- Where are you going?

652
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,194
I need to take a dump.

653
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,236
Be right back.

654
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,488
Stay here.

655
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,893
Dom, bro.

656
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:46,937
Bro?

657
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,069
Have you changed your mind?

658
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:04,496
What if we put this on hold?

659
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,874
Why?

660
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:09,668
Are you jealous?

661
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,754
Of the fact that I can make Imo happy?

662
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,131
I think I'm entitled to hesitate.

663
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,388
But this whole situationship

664
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,557
was your idea.

665
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,728
What are we? Gen-Zs?

666
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,647
What I'm asking you is simple.

667
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,233
Would you please just stop for now?

668
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,610
Right when she's falling for me?

669
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,240
You're just seeing things.

670
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,952
Dom.

671
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:55,797
And…

672
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,258
I never start

673
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,344
what I can't finish.

674
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,389
I don't ghost people.

675
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,019
Hey.

676
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,855
Hey.

677
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,190
Hey!

678
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,193
Let me out!

679
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,654
Let me out!

680
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,659
Hey!

681
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,496
Let me out!

682
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,477
You looked so tired.
I didn't wake you up for dinner.

683
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,898
I haven't seen you paint in a while.

684
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,107
Yeah, I know.

685
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,277
I guess I got inspired to paint again.

686
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,739
Inspired?

687
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,662
So,

688
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,122
where did this inspiration come from?

689
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,750
I don't know.

690
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,756
I don't even know
why I stopped in the first place.

691
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,766
Hold on.

692
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,644
Are you hungry?

693
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,937
I'll do it.

694
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,899
Just keep going.

695
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,821
Go on.

696
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,299
Do you need me
to pick up anything from the laundry?

697
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,885
No, it's all folded in the drawers.

698
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,600
What do you mean?

699
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,311
Nothing, I'm just surprised.

700
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,646
You've got a lot done today.

701
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,983
I've always been this way.
You just never noticed.

702
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,410
Dance with me.

703
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,830
Dance with me.

704
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,919
Aren't you busy?

705
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,091
When are we ever not busy?

706
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,321
Why did we ever let the old us slip away?

707
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:54,202
Remember when every little thing

708
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,287
made us laugh?

709
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,833
Why does it seem so hard now?

710
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,299
I guess we're just busy.

711
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,390
But do we still feel alive?

712
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,186
Will we always be like this?

713
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,356
Passing each other at home,
stuck with "hi" and "hello."

714
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,776
"Have you eaten yet?"

715
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,573
"I'll make you dinner."

716
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,536
Aren't you happy anymore?

717
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,497
Is that yours?

718
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,916
My phone's upstairs. Could be yours.

719
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,459
Don't answer that.

720
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,586
Wait, it might be important.

721
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,754
Hold on.

722
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,726
What are you all dressed up for?

723
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,355
AD called.
We're having an emergency meeting.

724
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,440
At this hour?

725
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,776
Yeah.

726
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,404
Okay, I'll drive you there.

727
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,905
No need. I'll book a cab.

728
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,514
What are you doing here?

729
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,057
Where's Imo?

730
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,434
I want to see my wife.

731
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,935
Imo's not here.

732
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,521
But even if she was,

733
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,816
I'm sure she wouldn't want to see you.

734
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,652
Imo.

735
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,405
- Come on out!
- I told you, she's not here.

736
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,699
What? You're scared, aren't you?

737
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,416
That's not what her kisses felt earlier.

738
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,961
Her kisses?

739
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,964
Do you know what they call that?

740
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,845
She's guilty because she's falling for me.

741
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,307
After that,

742
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,435
she'll stay awhile, but in truth?

743
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,479
She's slowly letting you go.

744
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,482
You asshole.

745
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:54,817
You fucking asshole.

746
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,037
You're

747
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,789
the dick here.

748
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,503
Of course.

749
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,506
That's why she'll pick me.

750
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,400
Damn you!

751
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,196
Just stop!

752
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,078
Goddamnit.

753
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,914
Find a way to fit 20 artists in one tent.

754
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,542
And why are we feeding them
afternoon and midnight snacks?

755
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,793
We're way over budget.

756
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,795
And yes, by tomorrow, you're fired.

757
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,804
Hello, ma'am.

758
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,348
Sorry, I'm running late.

759
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,101
- Madame B, I'm sorry.
- Madame B, this is…

760
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,648
And we're very interested
in making a TV show

761
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,984
out of <i>Hey, Wakey-wakey</i>.

762
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,362
Genflix Eight? The TV channel?

763
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,159
Especially now that

764
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,162
social causes matter more
to younger generations.

765
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,998
So, if you'll all agree,

766
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,168
we can start production
as early as next month.

767
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,461
- G!
- G, yes!

768
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,755
- Yes, ma'am. Our schedules are open.
- Yes. Let's go!

769
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,673
Let's go. Let's do this, right?

770
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,219
If we do it,
where would be the likely location?

771
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,975
Production will take place

772
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,227
partly on location
and partly in the studio.

773
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,173
I want to make it up to you.

774
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,206
Can I go back to Manila?

775
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,836
Oh, babe.

776
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,548
You could have picked
a better time to tell me.

777
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,716
Why?

778
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:54,390
An opportunity just came up.

779
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,769
<i>Hey, Wakey-wakey</i>'s getting a TV show.

780
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,487
You don't seem happy.

781
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,413
This is too good to pass up.

782
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,666
I just want my life to be worth something.

783
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,793
Imo…

784
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,630
Even your mom thinks that I'm worthless.

785
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,965
Then don't let her bother you.

786
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,927
What bothers me is that
you never defended me.

787
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,979
At least, now I have a career
that validates who I am.

788
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,565
That makes me feel

789
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,943
that I'm needed.

790
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,612
You can understand that, can't you?

791
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,586
<i>Hey. Wakey-wakey.</i>

792
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,135
<i>Hey. Wakey-wakey.</i>

793
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,720
<i>All right, standby.</i>

794
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:20,559
<i>Hey, Wakey-wakey, Philippines.</i>

795
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,396
<i>Today, we're on the lookout for cars</i>

796
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,481
<i>disregarding the bike lane.</i>

797
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,946
Oh, no. Sir.

798
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,656
Hey! What's wrong with you?

799
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,535
Hey! You prick!

800
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,787
Are you okay, sir?

801
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,580
Shameless idiot.

802
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,082
Are you okay, sir?

803
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,001
It's just a scratch.

804
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,627
Take care on the road, sir.

805
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,088
<i>How irresponsible.</i>

806
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,507
<i>The road doesn't belong to you.</i>

807
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,217
<i>Other people use it too.</i>

808
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,761
<i>I apologize for that, dear viewers.</i>

809
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,762
<i>It's just--</i>

810
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,806
<i>The adrenaline and the emotions.</i>

811
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,310
<i>Hey. Wakey-wakey.</i>

812
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,622
<i>How are you?</i>

813
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,084
I'm fine.

814
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,171
<i>The house is quiet.</i>

815
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,255
<i>Nobody's</i>

816
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:34,341
<i>watching boxing.</i>

817
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,056
It's quiet here, too.

818
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,517
<i>Because no one's been complaining.</i>

819
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,040
I had sex with someone else.

820
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,166
What?

821
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,127
When?

822
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,378
With who?

823
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:14,799
In a dream.

824
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:15,841
But you enjoyed it?

825
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,927
Do you want me to say that I did?

826
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,971
This is going nowhere.

827
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,431
There you go again.

828
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,141
You keep dodging when we talk.

829
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,402
What are we supposed to talk about?

830
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,281
Us.

831
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,201
My feelings.

832
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,205
Your feelings.

833
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,210
Us.

834
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,923
But I'm doing okay.

835
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,473
Oh dear. You're obviously not okay.

836
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:08,352
We're not okay.

837
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,193
What's happening, Dom?

838
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,029
Just spit it out.

839
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:25,161
Seven years in and I still can't tell
how you're feeling.

840
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,503
It's exhausting.

841
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,384
Maybe it's better…

842
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,931
Maybe it's better
if we give ourselves some space.

843
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:49,954
<i>Are you stressed out?</i>

844
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,333
<i>You only drink wine</i>
<i>when you're stressed out.</i>

845
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,627
<i>While we're not together,</i>

846
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,129
<i>we should use the time to relax.</i>

847
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,300
<i>And face the things we've been avoiding.</i>

848
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:06,637
<i>Like trying again.</i>

849
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,985
Would you hold this?

850
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,079
Oh, okay then.

851
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,444
Are you okay?

852
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:05,988
I'm okay.

853
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:20,521
<i>I know those first few years</i>
<i>of trying were hard.</i>

854
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,731
<i>But are we okay with giving up?</i>

855
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,401
<i>It's hard, I know.</i>

856
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,986
<i>But while we still can,</i>

857
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,781
<i>maybe we can still try.</i>

858
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,783
<i>And even if we never get lucky…</i>

859
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,796
Hey, you boys.

860
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:48,006
Hello, how's everyone?

861
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,175
- My, you're glowing today.
- Happy birthday, Auntie.

862
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,803
- Happy birthday, Auntie!
- You couldn't tell I'm 60, right?

863
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,138
You look like you're only 16.

864
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,222
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers!

865
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,600
I want everyone to have fun.

866
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,810
So, have fun.

867
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:05,566
You don't seem tipsy yet.

868
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:08,152
- Cheers, everyone.
- Happy birthday.

869
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,821
Son, how are you?

870
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,281
Why are you alone here?

871
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,825
Sister, happy birthday!

872
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:17,077
Sister!

873
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,291
- Oh, you really didn't have to.
- Now, look at her.

874
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:24,293
Let me introduce you to my daughter.

875
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,502
- Annie.
- Hi, Auntie.

876
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:26,962
She's a lawyer now.

877
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:28,255
One moment.

878
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:32,092
Dom, get up. Come here.

879
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:35,179
Do you remember my friend, Aunt Gina?

880
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,347
And her daughter, Annie.

881
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,892
The one I was setting you up with.

882
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,060
She's a lawyer now.

883
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,688
You guys are a perfect match.

884
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:47,816
Imo.

885
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,361
I'm glad you came.

886
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,619
Oh, my gosh.

887
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:01,747
Dear, you shouldn't have.

888
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,208
What a waste of jet fuel.

889
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,751
Sister!

890
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:10,714
- Imo? Can we talk?
- Oh, wow. This is my favorite.

891
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:14,510
I've been requesting this for a long time.

892
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:23,268
Thank you, everyone! You surprised me!

893
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,228
Imo.

894
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,605
Imo, wait.

895
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,027
Imo.

896
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,031
Imo, wait a minute.

897
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,158
What is it?

898
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,077
Are you taking all your stuff?

899
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,497
I'm going back to Manila.

900
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:45,666
My work's there.

901
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:46,959
Aren't you coming back?

902
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,044
Aren't you coming home to Manila?

903
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,213
Of course, I will.

904
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,173
But I'm stuck here for three months.

905
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,258
Well, then.

906
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,635
See you after three months.

907
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:57,761
See that?

908
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,514
You're still angry.

909
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:06,270
We should discuss this later.

910
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:07,980
After Mama's birthday.

911
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:12,067
But okay, I admit this is my fault.
I'm sorry.

912
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,027
You're blaming yourself again?

913
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,029
I'm just tired of fighting.

914
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,656
I'm sorry, okay? Come here.

915
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,242
- There you go again.
- What?

916
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:22,202
You never want to discuss things.

917
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,079
You never want to fight over them.

918
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,706
That strategy is seven years old.

919
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,416
And it never works with us.

920
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,667
What do you want?

921
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,294
That we start fighting
at a birthday party?

922
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:33,171
If that's the only way we'll fix
this relationship, then why not?

923
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,173
How can we fix things
if we're always fighting?

924
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,092
How can we fix things

925
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,761
if we always avoid talking
about our problems?

926
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:43,223
This problem will never be fixed
if we keep playing blind.

927
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:47,894
What do you want to do?

928
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,983
I read your note.

929
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,070
Do you want to try for a baby again?

930
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,113
Then we'll do that.

931
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,198
What is this?

932
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,950
Are you trying to bribe me with a baby?

933
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,744
Isn't that what you want?

934
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:07,873
All I want is for you
to tell me how you feel.

935
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:13,045
I never even knew you were blaming me
because we couldn't have a child.

936
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,672
The doctor said
that we both didn't have problems.

937
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:16,965
So, I don't blame you.

938
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,217
But for all we know, I'm the problem.

939
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,094
But you're taking it out on me.

940
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,862
Even when we're together,

941
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:42,240
you never know when I'm gone.

942
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,202
You don't even see me.

943
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:47,704
I keep talking, but no one's listening.

944
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,040
I exist,

945
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,668
but no one sees me.

946
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:57,297
What about me? Do you see me?

947
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:02,010
How frustrated I am
that I can't give you a family?

948
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,261
I want that too.

949
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:06,973
I ask myself every day

950
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,142
what do I have to do
and what am I missing?

951
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,144
Did I do something wrong? What do I do?

952
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,855
- Do I complain or do I cry?
- Complain about it to me.

953
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,941
At least, I'd feel that
we're still together.

954
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,819
Yes, we're together,

955
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,279
but I keep disappointing you.

956
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,743
Don't you get how hard it is

957
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:30,080
to fail people's expectations every time?

958
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:35,168
When you're complaining, it feels like

959
01:18:36,336 --> 01:18:38,380
you're complaining about me.

960
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,882
My personality, my capacity

961
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,010
and why I am the way I am.

962
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,556
I'm sorry, I can't be more than this.

963
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,979
I complain a lot

964
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,106
because I'm not happy.

965
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,317
Me too.

966
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,458
That's why you're just
letting me slip away.

967
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:27,554
What are you doing here?

968
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,438
You know what this is.

969
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,067
Isn't this what you wanted?

970
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,737
Finally,

971
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,988
you're free.

972
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,240
She's leaving you.

973
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:49,034
Don't listen to this asshole.

974
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,495
I can explain this.

975
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,332
Imo, come on. Let's go.

976
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,216
Does your wife know

977
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,967
what you were planning?

978
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,555
Imo, let me explain.

979
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,685
I did something wrong.

980
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:18,772
What?

981
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,735
I was so stupid.

982
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:26,238
What is it?

983
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,119
I asked him…

984
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,333
to seduce you.

985
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,426
I know.

986
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:54,850
I knew you put him up to it.

987
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,021
Is that yours?

988
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,858
My phone's upstairs. Could be yours.

989
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,276
Don't answer that.

990
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:14,119
MS. IMO! GOOD NEWS!
GENFLIX WANTS TO MEET TONIGHT.

991
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,746
ARE YOU FREE?

992
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,720
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.
WHERE ARE WE MEETING?

993
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,323
<i>Are you ready for her to leave?</i>

994
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:56,786
Dom?

995
01:21:58,663 --> 01:21:59,706
Dom?

996
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,334
<i>Dom?</i>

997
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:10,842
<i>Why, Dom?</i>

998
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,554
Why?

999
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,233
I thought I didn't want us anymore.

1000
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:30,946
That this wasn't the life I imagined.

1001
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,450
But I was wrong.

1002
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,914
I don't want to lose you.

1003
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,297
You should have left me instead.

1004
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,716
I can't bring myself to hurt you.

1005
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:57,514
You idiot!

1006
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,696
I never imagined
this would be my life too.

1007
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,701
But I never imagined a life without you.

1008
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,247
Miguel saw who I was.

1009
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,000
But all of that

1010
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,503
was just a setup.

1011
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,173
How could you be so cruel?

1012
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,676
I can't believe you.

1013
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,972
I was wrong.

1014
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,565
We promised each other
"for better or for worse."

1015
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,404
But you gave up at our worst.

1016
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,241
You don't deserve better.

1017
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:12,464
Dominic!

1018
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,760
Do you want cake?

1019
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,626
Hey.

1020
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:52,253
Hey.

1021
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:55,632
Hey. Miguel.

1022
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,134
Don't move.

1023
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:01,096
Would you stop that?

1024
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:03,056
Throw that away.

1025
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:04,307
What's wrong with you?

1026
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,392
Come here.

1027
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,730
What's wrong with you?

1028
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:13,608
This is my moment.

1029
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,402
You're ruining it.

1030
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,698
What are you trying to do?

1031
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,284
I just want to end it all.

1032
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,121
Fine, if you want,

1033
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:27,872
send me to prison.

1034
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,423
Imo.

1035
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,092
Imo, please.

1036
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:40,885
Don't lose hope in me.

1037
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:57,694
Okay, fine.

1038
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:00,029
I'll admit it.

1039
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,491
You got me thinking

1040
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,162
whether I was catching feelings for you.

1041
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,789
Or maybe I was just frustrated

1042
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,542
because my marriage
is going through a rough patch.

1043
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,544
I had so many emotions.

1044
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,797
Too many feelings.

1045
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,176
But then I thought

1046
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,553
it would be unfair to both of you.

1047
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,728
It turns out that
you're both being unfair to me.

1048
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,939
I want you. That part was true.

1049
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,360
The part where I loved you was true.

1050
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,739
None of what you said was true.

1051
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,825
You and Dom made a fool out of me.

1052
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,746
You know all of this

1053
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:51,539
is just temporary.

1054
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:54,542
You'll find love again.

1055
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:59,422
You'll find the right person for you.

1056
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,595
Still, I want to thank you.

1057
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,181
Because…

1058
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:11,976
Because of you…

1059
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,982
I figured out what I truly wanted.

1060
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:31,913
Imo.

1061
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:32,956
Wait.

1062
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:34,374
Where are you going?

1063
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,795
I'm calling the authorities.

1064
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:41,589
Just stay there.

1065
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:44,884
I'll get someone to bring you home.

1066
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:46,761
You idiot.

1067
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,267
Why don't you join me, grandchild?

1068
01:28:58,458 --> 01:28:59,667
Have some of this, dear.

1069
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:01,878
- Try it.
- Okay.

1070
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:04,380
This is great. It's turmeric.

1071
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,758
It does wonders for inflammation.

1072
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:07,842
There.

1073
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:09,218
Drink up.

1074
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,971
- Thank you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

1075
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:14,223
Grandma Mae.

1076
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,352
It's my heart that hurts.

1077
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:20,063
Not my joints.

1078
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:22,523
Oh, it's all the same.

1079
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,984
For all kinds of stress.

1080
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:31,157
Do you think that

1081
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,284
I'll be able to forgive Dom?

1082
01:29:33,993 --> 01:29:36,412
Don't you have any love left for him?

1083
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:39,457
There's a lot left over.

1084
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,125
That's good then.

1085
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,169
We can still reheat some of it.

1086
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,968
Of course, the wounds are still fresh.

1087
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:54,847
In marriage,
hurting each other is inevitable.

1088
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:57,558
Have you ever seen a marriage

1089
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,311
where the couple is happy all the time?

1090
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,690
What matters most

1091
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,485
is the capacity to soothe our wounds.

1092
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,071
True love has the capacity

1093
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:13,282
to heal and repair.

1094
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:18,871
Oh, God.

1095
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,207
I didn't know you were such an expert.

1096
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,671
What about you and Grandpa?

1097
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,214
What happened there?

1098
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,550
Why didn't that last?

1099
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:33,719
You know your Grandma.
I don't need men in my life.

1100
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,436
I have to go.

1101
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:47,233
Isn't it big?

1102
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:49,026
Come on, Grandma Mae.

1103
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,363
Dom.

1104
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,039
But Ma, it won't be that easy for him.

1105
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:05,001
Especially with Sis Imo
blowing up everywhere.

1106
01:31:05,084 --> 01:31:07,795
He will eventually get over that chick.

1107
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:12,508
When you and Aya get together,

1108
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:15,136
she'll bear you a child.

1109
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,393
Dominic, sit back down!

1110
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:38,284
From now on,
you don't get to speak ill of her.

1111
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,078
Especially in front of me.

1112
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:45,374
Dominic.

1113
01:31:58,512 --> 01:31:59,889
I'm doing fine, doc.

1114
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:02,934
Okay, just relax.
We'll start with the oral prophylaxis.

1115
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:04,268
Okay, doc.

1116
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:09,667
Granny, where's Imo?

1117
01:33:19,468 --> 01:33:21,595
But I really need to speak to her.

1118
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,017
Son of a--

1119
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,936
Didn't you hear me? You annoying brat!

1120
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,063
Imo! Get in here!

1121
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:00,760
I'm sorry for coming down here.

1122
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,307
I know you're not ready.

1123
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,434
And I don't want to force you.

1124
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,568
You're probably…

1125
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:22,907
still wondering…

1126
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,620
how I could have done that to you.

1127
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,211
I didn't know it would be like this.

1128
01:34:37,963 --> 01:34:39,799
I didn't know it would be this hard.

1129
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,178
I can't take it.

1130
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,848
I can't handle losing you.

1131
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:58,692
I know it must be hard to forget all that.

1132
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:05,157
But I hope you can forgive me.

1133
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:09,703
Come home.

1134
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:28,013
Dom, I know I'm not perfect.

1135
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:34,145
I wasn't the best wife.

1136
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,944
So I want to apologize to you.

1137
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:52,788
Because I don't always see you, too.

1138
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:57,835
But…

1139
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,965
if I forgive you now…

1140
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:09,305
I'd be unfair to myself, too.

1141
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:21,609
Getting back together now

1142
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:25,863
would be like putting
a band-aid on the wounds.

1143
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,949
And never letting them heal.

1144
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,790
Dom, that's what I'm asking.

1145
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:50,930
You don't want us anymore, babe?

1146
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:54,141
I love you.

1147
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:58,812
But I can't do this right now.

1148
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:01,875
Long time no see.

1149
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,422
Just one year?

1150
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:11,802
You didn't come to the batch reunion.
I was looking for you.

1151
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:19,727
Purposefully avoided it?
Or purposefully avoided me?

1152
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:22,855
You and I are ancient history.

1153
01:38:22,938 --> 01:38:24,481
I've moved on since then, Marlon.

1154
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:26,317
And yet you haven't changed a bit.

1155
01:38:28,777 --> 01:38:30,696
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1156
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:34,783
Excuse me, good afternoon.

1157
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,536
Judge Casimiro's chambers
will be on break for lunch.

1158
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,955
You may come back at 1 p.m. Thank you.

1159
01:38:40,956 --> 01:38:43,751
I thought they didn't have
lunch breaks in government offices.

1160
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,878
They need to eat. They're people too.

1161
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:54,637
Is that okay, Imo?

1162
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,389
Okay, attorney. See you at 1 p.m.

1163
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,558
All right, 1 p.m.

1164
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:12,321
Do you want to go get lunch?

1165
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,619
Ma'am, I'll have

1166
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:20,871
the mung beans,
fried mackerel and veggies.

1167
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:22,247
Okay, one moment, sir.

1168
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:29,421
Mung beans and mackerel, sir.

1169
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,883
Your veggies, ma'am.

1170
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,158
How have you been?

1171
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:00,953
You first.

1172
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:03,414
I want to know how you've been.

1173
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:07,084
Well, I'm back in Manila again.

1174
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:17,010
I got promoted because of my project.

1175
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:19,972
The clients were happy.

1176
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:23,726
So happy that
they got me a car as a bonus.

1177
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:27,229
So I told them to just give me an e-bike.

1178
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:31,400
"Imo might say I never listen to her."

1179
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,871
But you know, sometimes…

1180
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,419
I still miss you.

1181
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,555
How have you been?

1182
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:06,101
I bought a condo in Ortigas.

1183
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:08,896
And our show just got renewed.

1184
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,735
Actually, I'm happy.

1185
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:33,045
Have you forgiven me, babe?

1186
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:42,930
I think so.

1187
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:49,561
Do you still love me?

1188
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:14,711
Are Mr. and Mrs. Brizuela
on their way back?

1189
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:16,046
They're not picking up.

1190
01:42:16,129 --> 01:42:17,923
What's taking them so long?

1191
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:20,926
Excuse me, I'll just get back
to Judge Casimiro.

1192
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:24,615
<i>We promised each other</i>
<i>"for better or for worse."</i>

1193
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:28,577
<i>But you gave up at our worst.</i>

1194
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,206
<i>You don't deserve better.</i>

1195
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:47,304
<i>Maybe what we need is some space.</i>

1196
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:48,221
<i>I love you.</i>

1197
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,018
<i>What about</i>

1198
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:54,937
<i>three kids?</i>

1199
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,439
<i>What are you, a sissy? Only three?</i>

1200
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:01,568
<i>You can have my Puso.</i>

1201
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:11,745
<i>Imogen Karuhatan.</i>

1202
01:44:12,996 --> 01:44:14,081
<i>Imo.</i>

1203
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,211
It’s really pretty here in Cebu.

1204
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,298
Yeah.

1205
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:48,341
So pretty.

1206
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:54,681
If you like it here,

1207
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:56,641
let's just stay here.

1208
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,061
What?

1209
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:14,678
We Filipinos,

1210
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,347
we're way too focused on love.

1211
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:20,725
It's like life feels incomplete

1212
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:22,727
when we’re single.

1213
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,409
Who's that?

1214
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,954
I've been here for a while,
and you’re just ignoring me?

1215
01:47:46,751 --> 01:47:49,171
Idiot, my name's Sofia!

1216
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:51,965
Goodbye, James.

1217
01:47:52,048 --> 01:47:53,383
Miguel.

1218
01:47:53,466 --> 01:47:54,843
Goodbye, Miguel.

1219
01:47:54,926 --> 01:48:00,473
<i>Whatever makes you happy,</i>
<i>even if it's something small, go for it.</i>

1220
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:03,643
Yes, you have
to prioritize yourself always,

1221
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,437
in any situation.
