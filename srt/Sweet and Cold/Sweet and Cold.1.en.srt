Get on your knees.

We don't have to do that, do we?

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,240
Get on your knees.

That's the maid of honor, Miss Meng.

You saw her.

64
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,320
She is very professional
as a bridesmaid.

65
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,790
How's that? Is she pretty?

66
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,790
Is that your wife's best friend?

67
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,670
No.

The bride.

94
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,040

on your husband's ring finger.

you may now open your man's arms

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,920
to embrace and kiss
your beautiful bride.

100
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,160
One more.

101
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,720

Fine.

104
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,230
I can’t do it.

105
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,390
The bride can't do it.

106
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,390
I won.

107
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,390
This way, right?

108
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,110
This way.

109
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
How?

110
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,550
This way, this way.

111
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,830
This way, this way.

This way, this way.

This way, this way.

116
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,720
Hand in it.

117
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,200
It’s impossible.

118
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,670
Aren't you going to play?

119
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,480
Thanks.

120

You're the boldest crisis manager

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,510
I've ever seen.

122
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,600
I quit.

123
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,880
You can't leave now, best man.

124
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,550
Miss Meng.

125
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,110
Well, you made it.

126
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,790
What's the matter?

127
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,160
Best man just quit.

128
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,040
Why?

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,110
He and the groom's side of the family

130
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,350
fell out for some reason.

131
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,160
He just walked away.

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
I can't even hold him back.

133
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,760
What do you think

134
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,830
we're gonna do now?

135
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,440
We have to have a best man.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,550
Hello.

137
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,920
Are you 183 centimeters tall?

138
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,200
Yes.

139
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,160
That's great.

140
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,230
Because there was a situation,

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,230
and the best man left.

142
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,550
But I won't allow anything to
go wrong with the wedding.

143
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,830
I've been through it all.

144
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,320
You're the only one who
can slip on his clothes.

145
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,040
Do me a favor.

146
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
No, I haven't done that.

147
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,880
I have no experience.

148
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,640
It doesn't matter.

149
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,670
The MC will teach you.

150
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
You are Yu Yang's good
brother, aren't you?

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,080
Yes, I am.

152
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,790
Then why are you hesitating?

153
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,960
I don't need you to put yourself
out there for your brother.

154
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,550
All you have to do is be the
best man to the rescue.

155
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
Make sure the wedding goes smoothly.

156
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,200
No matter what way.

157
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,350
That's what I do.

158
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,440
But I think you're

159
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,320
a little underqualified for the job.

160
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,150
It would be a shame

161
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,400
not to take the job on your terms.

162
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,790
So you're giving me a compliment?

163
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,520
Mr. Leng.

164
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,960
How much can you drink?

165
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,790
Brothers.

166
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,280
Let's move on to the next part.

167
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,550
As the old rules.

168
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,590
Whichever side wins takes
all the red envelopes.

169
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,670
We will win, we will win.

170
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,470
No, you can't.

171
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,150
Come on, come on.

172
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Mr. Leng.

173
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
I'll do it first.

174
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,110
I'm sure I'll win.

175
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:17,200
Come on, come on.

176
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,030
Ok.

177
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,030
You have work tomorrow morning.

178
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,150
You have to go to work.

179
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
You're just gonna have two
drinks and pretend to be drunk?

180
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,670
Is it OK?

181
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,670
Siming.

182
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,280
We won.

183
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
Wake up. Wake up, Siming.

184
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Really?

185
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,350
Siming, Siming.

186
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,230
Wake up, you.

187
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,840
Siming.

188
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,670
Siming.

189
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,350
That's a lot to drink.

190
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,960
Thanks.

191
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,470
Sister Tian.

192
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,080
The video was posted to the
company's official blog.

193
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,280
The response was good.

194
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,080
Hello, we are the staff of "Pi Video".

195
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,670
We want to do a street interview.

196
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,110
And we were wondering

197
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,840
if you were married?

198
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,960
No.

199
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,030
We're not married yet.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,710
What if...

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,760
Ok.

202
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,080
What's that noise?

203
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,230
I don't know.

204
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,110
I'll take a look over there.

205
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,880
You take care of them for a while.

206
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,590
All right, just go.

207
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,110
Ok.

208
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,590
He must have wandered into the room

209
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
without noticing.

210
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,910
I'm sorry, Miss Meng.

211
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,760
I know he can't hold his liquor.

212
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,080
I didn't expect it to be this bad.

213
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,640
You know he can't drink it.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
People who say it's okay
usually can't drink it.

215
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,960
People who can handle
alcohol say they can't.

216
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,710
So you saw right through him.

217
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,000
Come on.

218
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,840
Overtime fee.

219
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,710
Don't you say 8:00 sharp?

220
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,640
It's seven past nine.

221
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,150
Let's call it an hour.

222
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,000
I thought...

223
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,760
No problem, no problem.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,910
What about him?

225
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,840
You know what, Miss Meng.

226
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,320
He came by car.

227
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,710
I'll get you two a proxy driver.

228
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,710
I'll give you money for another hour.

229
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,440
Why don't you take him back for me?

230
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,710
Forget it.

231
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,670
For the sake of the big red envelope.

232
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,320
I need the keys and the address.

233
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,230
Thank you.

234
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll get it for you right now.

235
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,960
But you can rest assured, Miss Meng.

236
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,230
He drinks little and
has a fast metabolism.

237
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,910
The alcohol will be metabolized
in four or five hours.

238
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,110
I'm sorry to bother you.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
Don't move, don't move, dizzy.

240
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,590
This is getting a little old.

241
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,590
That's right.

242
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,760
I feel sick.

243
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,280
Throw up freely.

244
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,030
Sister, that's very kind of you.

245
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,080
it doesn't matter

246
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,150
It's your car, anyway.

247
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,470
You... Don't you throw up on me.

248
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,440
Do you want to stop?

249
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,400
Master.

250
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,030
Why don't you

251
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,960
turn that dashcam around.

252
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,150
Before he throws up in
the car and blames us.

253
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,230
You are so good at everything.

254
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,000
But you're just being too cautious.

255
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,880
You are beautiful.

256
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,030
But you're not cute enough.

257
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,350
Sit down.

258
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,590
Here we are.

259
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,470
It's too heavy.

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,200
Don't tell me I don't take care of you.

261
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,320
I've been very kind to you.

262
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,080
Do it yourself.

263
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,550
Yeah, get up.

264
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,350
Mobile phone.

265
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
You crushed my phone.

266
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,800
Why is it 10:00?

267
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,430
It's over, it's over.

268
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,430
Late, late.

269
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,160
Hello, hello.

270
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,310
Hello, is this Miss Meng?

271
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,190
I'm Leng Siming.

272
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,430
The best man yesterday.

273
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,190
How did you get my number?

274
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,430
Come on.

275
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,950
That's my phone you're holding.

276
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,640
Yeah, get up.

277
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,880
Hello?

278
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,880
I need my phone back

279
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,950
at 7:00 tonight.

280
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,800
You name a place.

281
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,590
Ok.

282
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,520
Then the Huayitang Flower Shop.

283
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Call me when you get there.

284
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,920
Ok.

285
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
It's okay. I got to go.

286
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,520
Wait a minute.

287
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,950
Someone called you just now.

288
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,160
He said it was half an hour early.

289
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,880
He called himself Mr. Li.

290
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,640
What?

291
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,800
What?

292
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,920
Are you sure it was Mr. Li?

293
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,560
Leng Siming, I have

294
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,110
a very, very, very important
matter right now.

295
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,040
I need you to do me a favor.

296
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,920
You turn on my phone.

297
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,520
I want you to find someone
named Feng Shuai.

298
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
Tell him he needs

299
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,760
to be on the battlefield by 11:00.

300
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,280
My password is 332334.

301
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,350
Do you remember Feng
Shuai's phone number?

302
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,070
What do you mean?

303
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,310
930607.

304
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,920
Do it yourself.

305
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,230
Gemini.

306
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,560
That's a lot of division.

307
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,830
There's more.

308
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,040
When someone calls me.

309
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
Remember to get that for me.

310
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,880
Are you sober and you're driving?

311
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Don't get caught drunk driving.

312
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,000
Don't worry.

313
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,070
I already checked my own alcohol level.

314
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,590
I fit the driving criteria perfectly.

315
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,070
It won't be any trouble for you.

316
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,520
You were a kid in '93.

317
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,560
Ok, let me have a look.

318
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,110
Okay, you go to the
engineering department.

319
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,040
Come this way.

320
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,520
You didn't even fill it out here.

321
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,230
You can fill it out again over there.

322
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
You didn't fill it all out here.

323
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,640
Go ahead and fill it out.

324
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,710
You go to the public
relations department.

325
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,280
There.

326
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,430
Hello.

327
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,000
On what basis

328
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,310
do you assign interns?

329
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,680
Did you fill out the form?

330
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,920
Just fill it out.

331
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,470
There's a vacancy in the
Marketing Department right now.

332
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,470
Why the Marketing Department?

333
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,430
Why so much why?

334
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,400
It's randomly assigned.

335
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,590
Shouldn't it be based on

336
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,400
each person's idiosyncrasies?

337
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,190
Then test

338
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,110
the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator.

339
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,950
Every intern who can stay at Lingzhi

340
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,470
is excellent

341
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,280
and knows everything.

342
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,310
And.

343
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,760
We have 30 or 50 people a week.

344
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,560
We don't have time to
test them individually.

345
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,520
You can stay if you want to
stay, otherwise you can leave.

346
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,230
I'm really sorry, Mr. Li.

347
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,520
I'll have to wait on
you downstairs today.

348
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,950
Our company is moving recently.

349
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,430
This place is a mess.

350
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,680
I beg your pardon.

351
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,920
The Wenxuan Building is so magnificent.

352
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
Why are you moving?

353
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,400
Although it is very grand.

354
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
But our company has been

355
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,160
expanding too fast recently.

356
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,520
There's no room for so many
people in this building.

357
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,710
Sure, Miss Meng.

358
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,680
I haven't seen you in years.
You've made it big.

359
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,350
No.

360
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,760
Mr. Li.

361
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,560
I recently asked a friend abroad

362
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,830
to bring you some sugar.

363
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,230
Zero calories and no sucrose.

364
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,190
It's very good.

365
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,430
Last time Mr. Zhou came,

366
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,110
he took several bags with him.

367
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,680
It's Zhou Yu from Five Elements Media.

368
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,800
That's right.

369
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,590
What a coincidence.

370
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,880
Our company did a video on the theme

371
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,190
of women born in the 1980s.

372
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,680
Mr. Zhou's wife liked it.

373
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,710
It's a small world.

374
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,160
Zhou and I are both
schoolmates and peers.

375
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,710
We had tea together last week.

376
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,640
Really?

377
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,310
That's right.

378
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,160
What a coincidence.

379
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,160
Right.

380
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,040
What a coincidence.

381
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,070
You eat sugar.

382
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,350
Miss Meng.

383
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,880
What a coincidence.

384
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,950
I caught you here.

385
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,430
I'm in the middle of something.

386
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,430
What can I do for you?

387
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,190
I have a little thing to tell you.

388
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,160
The unit next to your company

389
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,470
is interested in moving recently.

390
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,710
So you can rent the whole floor.

391
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,430
There's no need to move.

392
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,190
Save a lot of trouble.

393
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,430
Good.

394
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,710
I'll think about it.

395
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,560
All right, Miss Meng.

396
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,640
Then you can think about
it and contact me.

397
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,830
I'm Feng, the agent.

398
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,680
I won't bother you, Miss Meng.

399
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,710
Go about your business.

400
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,760
Bye.

401
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
It's really annoying
that he didn't tell me.

402
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,950
We're halfway there.

403
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,950
Yeah?

404
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,590
I told you all about

405
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,040
the meeting in advance.

406
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,230
No problem.

407
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,470
What did I tell you?

408
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,110
You should go to the
Marketing Department.

409
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,830
You're in the wrong place.

410
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,710
This is the conference room.

411
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,880
Get out, Mr. Yuan is coming.

412
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,710
It's not... I'm...

413
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,760
- Get out of here.
- I'm here to...

414
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,590
Mr. Yuan.

415
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,350
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Leng is already here.

416
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,760
Mr. Leng.

417
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,000
Hello, everyone.

418
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,520
I'm the new chief technology officer.

419
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,950
My name is Leng Siming.

420
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,470
Mr. Leng

421
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,520
is a top talent

422
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,310
recommended by Mr. Li Donghai

423
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,640
and interviewed by Mr. Yuan.

424
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,640
I hope he can bring us

425
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,040
more new vitality.

426
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,430
Thank you, thank you.

427
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,280
Today, as soon as I
entered the company,

428
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,880
I felt the encouragement and goodwill

429
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,590
of my colleagues in
various departments.

430
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,800
I want to use my tech support

431
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,230
to start from the inside.

432
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,110
Which department should we start with?

433
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,230
Let's start with

434
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,760
human resources.

435
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,680
The HR department

436
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,710
is the most stressful in our company.

437
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,590
The department faces a large
number of interns every day.

438
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,590
It's really hard to
distribute and manage.

439
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,190
So I'm going to do

440
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,520
an online summary today.

441
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,560
Includes

442
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,520
online Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

443
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,000
and a semi-encrypted scoring system.

444
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,430
And the choice of preferred
department and so on.

445
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,520
Try to go paperless.

446
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,160
Take the pressure off the
human resources department.

447
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,590
What a coincidence.

448
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:18,830
Miss Meng.

449
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
Look.

450
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,470
Chief Assistant Zhou just sent me

451
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,800
some information about his artists.

452
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,000
He said he wanted to be

453
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,560
in our next video on Millennials.

454
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,470
Ok.

455
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,430
Why don't you talk to her first.

456
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,110
I'll meet her later to
go over the details.

457
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,950
Ok, fine.

458
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,760
You eat sugar.

459
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,350
No.

460
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,310
How about this.

461
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,430
Miss Meng.

462
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,040
Please send me the contract
as soon as possible.

463
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,110
I'll let the legal
department go through.

464
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,830
No problem.

465
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,190
No problem. That's good.

466
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,430
Amy, send Mr. Li.

467
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,230
Take the sugar with you.

468
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,400
This is embarrassing.

469
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,950
That's the deal on the contract.

470
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,070
Ok, thanks.

471
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,760
I won't see you off.

472
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,470
All right, see you later.

473
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,710
Come on, Mr. Li, take your time.

474
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,590
Come on.

475
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,640
Sister Tian.

476
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,560
Are we doing this right?

477
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,190
I'm a little unsure.

478
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,430
What are you afraid of?

479
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,560
Don't you have confidence in
my ability to do business?

480
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,590
How could I not have faith in you?

481
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,560
I have no faith in Mr. Li.

482
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,070
I'm afraid he knows

483
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,590
we're a five-person company.

484
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,880
That's it.

485
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,160
What Mr. Li wants is
our business results.

486
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,880
Not for the office space.

487
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,520
Just sign the contract.

488
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,760
I'm absolutely sure he won't regret it.

489
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,640
Let’s go.

490
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,830
Hello.

491
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,920
Hi, are you free tonight?

492
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,520
Do you want to come out for a drink?

493
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,470
Excuse me.

494
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,350
If you need to contact
the owner of the phone,

495
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,430
please call back after 7 p.m.

496
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,190
Who are you?

497
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,430
Isn't that Leng Siming's phone?

498
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,560
Didn't you just get married?

499
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,520
Ask me out again.

500
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
It's so romantic.

501
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,070
I'm not romantic with you either.

502
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,560
Go ahead. What am I doing here?

503
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,760
I thought you were on wedding leave?

504
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,070
Stop it.

505
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,230
I just woke up

506
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,470
to see the gossip in
our department group.

507
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,560
They told me about

508
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,640
a handsome CTO who was a hit.

509
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,230
He choked the man as
soon as he arrived.

510
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,040
But the personnel director

511
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,310
is with Mr. Yuan.

681
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,430
Take him to the cafe outside.

682
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,350
It's too late.

683
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,630
Miss Meng.

684
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,870
This is real Pi Video, isn't it?

685
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,590
Mr. Li.

686
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,080
Mr. Li.

687
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,430
I can explain.

688
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,670
Miss Meng.

689
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,390
What do you mean?

690
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,960
Are you making a monkey out of me?

691
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,760
Our company was founded
only three years ago.

692
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,960
I could never afford
to rent that place.

693
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,430
If it was this door,

694
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm afraid you wouldn't
even look at us.

695
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,430
We're a content company.

696
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,630
I do this in the hope that

697
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,800
you will have a chance to take
a good look at our content.

698
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,430
I believe that Pi Video is capable of

699
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,960
completing all your requirements.

700
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,630
Even better than companies

701
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,630
that talk the talk.

702
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,670
All we need is a door.

703
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,320
How am I supposed to trust you

704
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,830
when you do this?

705
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,350
You have seen our plan last time.

706
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,150
Now I open the real door.

707
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,720
If you'd like to come in,

708
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,960
I respect your choice.

709
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,150
Sister Tian.

710
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,390
So what do we do now?

711
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,430
Did you get in touch with Mr. Zhou?

712
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,670
We've been in touch
with the Five Elements.

713
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,760
But they just won't give us

714
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
Zhou's contact information.

715
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,670
I'm going out.

716
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,390
Send it to my phone when it's done.

717
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,080
It's up to you to take care of it.

718
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,430
You can rest assured of that.

719
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,630
As for the spokesperson,

720
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,560
we decided to use Zhao Shiyan.

721
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,280
After all these years of cooperation.

722
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,430
And everyone was happy with it.

723
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,190
Please ask Mr. Zhou to prepare
the contract extension.

724
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,110
Sure.

725
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,110
Siming.

726
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,080
Here.

727
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,240
Let me introduce to you.

728
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:19,870
This is

729
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,350
our new chief technology officer.

730
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,080
Leng Siming.

731
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,110
This is Mr. Zhou from
Five Elements Media.

732
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,190
He specializes in

733
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,870
the endorsement of our products.

734
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
So young.

735
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,800
Nice to meet you.

736
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,430
Mr. Yuan.

737
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,390
I heard that Zhao Shiyan's appointment

738
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,560
will expire soon.

739
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,670
What do you think?

740
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,830
Today I invite Mr. Zhou

741
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,320
to discuss this matter.

742
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,630
As for Zhao Shiyan's fee, I am sure

743
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,630
the increase will not
exceed 20 percent.

744
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,320
That's 60 percent of
our distribution fee.

745
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,240
I didn't expect you just
come to the company,

746
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,080
all aspects of the business
understanding are very fast.

747
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,430
I just have to go first.

748
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:54,910
Siming.

749
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,960
I need you to see Mr. Zhou off.

750
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,960
Zhao Shiyan is a new winner this year.

751
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,670
Her other endorsements

752
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,240
have all risen more than 50 percent.

753
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,720
Mr. Leng.

754
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,110
You're so well informed.

755
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,430
You know something about that, right?

756
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,190
According to Zhou's meaning,

757
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,630
such a high price is friendship price.

758
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,910
The price is set by the market.

759
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,960
We should follow the trend.

760
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,760
Mr. Leng.

761
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,960
It's my wife's birthday today.

762
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,320
Well, if you'll excuse me, then.

763
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,870
Stop by my place sometime.

764
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,390
I'll leave you alone.

765
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,800
Friendship price.

766
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,110
What brings you to Lingzhi?

767
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,080
Mr. Yuan.

768
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,080
Long time no see.

769
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,480
Mr. Yuan?

770
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,320
Well, that's kind of crazy

771
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,430
for you to call me that.

772
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,670
Didn't you choose your career

773
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,960
over me?

774
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,870
It's an appropriate title.

775
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,760
You're still blaming me for
saying that, aren't you?

776
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,280
I told you to

777
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,390
wait for me.

778
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,800
You're the one who won't.

779
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,630
You're not gonna talk about marriage

780
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,800
until you're in the CEO's chair?

781
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,280
And obviously you're
not successful either.

782
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,960
So my choice and judgment

783
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,190
are very correct.

784
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,590
I can't believe you
haven't changed a bit

785
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,240
over the years.

786
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
But I don't think

787
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
you'd be so mean

788
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,150
even if we broke up.

789
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,590
No, Mr. Yuan.

790
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,630
You're thinking too much.

791
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,430
Now it's out in public.

792
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,240
That's not the best thing
to say to me, is it?

793
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,080
Zhao Shiyan's contract...

794
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Remember...

795
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,870
Make that contract...

796
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,430
Mr. Zhou.

797
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,110
Long time no see.

798
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,870
Who are you?

799
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,800
This is Meng Haotian from Pi Video.

800
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,190
[Meng Haotian]
Nice to meet you.

801
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

802
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,320
I have to go first.

803
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,480
Mr. Zhou.

804
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,670
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou.

805
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,870
I'll just take a minute of your time.

806
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,350
I have a very important video

807
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,480
I want you to see.

808
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,190
I promise I won't let you down.

809
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,730
[The video is 99% rendered, and I blame the
machine for being so old. I'm sorry Miss Meng.]

810
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,480
Just a moment, please.

811
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
It'll be ready soon.

812
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
I'm so sorry.

813
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,320
I'm really in a hurry.

814
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,560
Excuse me, Mr. Zhou.

815
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,630
I'm being a little presumptuous today.

816
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,590
Please accept my business card.

817
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,960
All right, let's talk
about it sometime.

818
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,720
Mr. Zhou, I'm sorry.

819
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,240
Can I help you?

820
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,350
Help me catch up with
the blue car ahead.

821
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,910
It's right ahead.

822
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,670
What's the matter with you?

823
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,480
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on it?

824
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,800
Are you going to make
me break traffic rules?

825
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,960
I'm curious.

826
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,590
What exactly do you do?

827
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,480
Why is your business so extensive?

828
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
And why do you have to go after Mr.
Zhou?

829
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,590
What do you know?

830
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,760
I don't just need him.

831
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,080
I have to do it today.

832
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,430
Do you know

833
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,390
it's his wife's birthday today?

834
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,830
Nonsense.

835
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,430
Why else would I go after him?

836
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:02,960
