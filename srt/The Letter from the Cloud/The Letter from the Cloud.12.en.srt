1
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,760
A little boy

2
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,199
Yeah

3
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,560
My master and I are in this optimism

4
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,279
He was treated for a long time for eye diseases

5
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
But then

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
What happened afterwards

7
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,559
I never saw it again

8
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,079
Why

9
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,239
Remember that time when he had poor eyesight

10
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,799
I always call him a little blind man

11
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,759
I can't believe you are really

12
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,080
The naughty boy who saved me in those days

13
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,360
That's right

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
What if Jilu is taken away by them

15
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,279
You take this and let it go

16
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Have some water

17
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,959
You are very expensive now

18
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,239
Can you just let me go

19
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,919
I won't drink until you let me go

20
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:14,959
It's over

21
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,599
It's all over

22
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,279
No one should drink it

23
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,559
You guys are so bullying, you know

24
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,480
You ran away overnight

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,199
I chased my little master all the way

26
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,559
Bully people

27
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,680
Didn't I make you chase

28
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,239
I'm taking a good walk. Why did you bring me back?

29
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:28,919
Right

30
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,559
They're safe now

31
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:35,879
It's over

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,160
You're done, you're done

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,120
My reinforcements are here

34
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,000
Shut up

35
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,320
False

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's go

37
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,360
We fell for it

38
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,559
Xiaguan is ineffective in doing things

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,279
Be caught in Qi Zhang's trickery

40
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,839
In the wooden box they escorted,

41
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,240
It's not Ji Lu

42
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,639
It's our missing one of our own

43
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,839
Jilu knows too many of our secrets

44
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,960
If he falls into Qi Zhang's hands,

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,759
This bureau

46
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,679
We will have no room for manoeuvre

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Xiaguan understands

48
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,600
Xiaguan must

49
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,119
Eradicate Jilu as soon as possible

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,199
I'm afraid it is

51
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,080
Qi Zhang won't give you another chance

52
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,039
The wind and waves are sharp

53
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,039
The people on this ship

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,320
Too many

55
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,800
If

56
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,479
Jilu identifies Wang Ye

57
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,720
Xiaguan must take the blame for the prince

58
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,320
Not to take the blame

59
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,800
Is to repay the kindness

60
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes

61
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,279
Yes yes yes

62
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,119
Is to repay the kindness

63
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,679
Is to repay the kindness

64
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,559
What

65
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,160
Han Zhenyun left with Zhenji Road

66
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,880
It is impossible

67
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,039
I clearly checked it in the morning

68
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,919
There is someone in one of the boxes

69
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,440
There are indeed people

70
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,520
But not Jilu

71
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,279
Is the dark line that has been staring at us

72
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,239
After I caught him

73
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:00,920
Stuff into a box

74
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,559
Escort all the way

75
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,519
Only in this way can we confuse the enemy

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,119
That is to say

77
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,160
You have made a drama of true and false auspicious roads

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,880
In order to repair the plank road and cross the warehouse secretly

79
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,480
It can be said that

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,959
Then why didn't you tell me

81
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,640
Shouting made me hoarse

82
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,799
If you don't show your true feelings,

83
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:21,839
How can you confuse the enemy

84
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,720
Let them think that

85
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
There is a real auspicious road in there

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,959
You can give me a hint

87
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,279
You have to trust my acting

88
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,040
Good

89
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,399
Next time there is a chance

90
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,160
I'll let you know in advance

91
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,440
This plan

92
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,000
Except for General Han

93
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,079
Who else knows

94
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,880
Do Gao Mo and I know

95
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,839
With Gao Mo's fiery character,

96
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,839
Told him

97
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,959
Doesn't it mean that everyone in the world knows

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,279
Also

99
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Gao Mo's doubts about us are written on his forehead

100
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,559
But there are also advantages to this

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,040
What benefits

102
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,480
According to his fanfare,

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,880
I gave him a little information about Jilu

104
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,480
He will investigate the case high

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
In this way

106
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,119
It can confuse the enemy

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,720
It can buy us time again

108
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
If we know Gao Qingtian,

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,920
Being used by you like this

110
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,399
What kind of anger does it look like

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,640
I'm afraid he's not the only one who's angry

112
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,200
That day

113
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,600
If you hadn't rashly recognized Gu Yi,

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
Let her be prepared to join hands with Qi Zhang

115
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,359
Not today

116
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,480
Father calms his anger

117
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,119
Qi Zhang made a diversion

118
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,119
Sent away Jilu

119
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,720
If you really let him tell the truth in the punishments department,

120
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,720
I'm afraid I'm going to become the abandoned son of the prince

121
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Father need not worry

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,559
As long as people don't arrive at the lobby of the punishments department for one

123
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,880
We all have a chance

124
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,399
How

125
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,000
You got a plan

126
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
The spies came to report

127
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,239
In Qi Zhang's motorcade,

128
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,679
Without that Han Zhenyun

129
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,959
Presumably Jilu

130
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,279
Is in his hands

131
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:18,720
Begin

132
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,480
So many people

133
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,799
I'm not playing with you guys anymore

134
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,279
Drive

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,920
The hour has come

136
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,640
Shall I wipe off the medicine for you

137
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:13,640
Good

138
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,359
If you don't wipe it again

139
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to lose it

140
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,440
Wrist

141
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,279
I'll wipe it now

142
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,079
You used to

143
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,799
Ever suffered from eye diseases

144
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,519
All right

145
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,040
It is also caused by poisoning

146
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:08,519
Yes

147
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,959
Then the doctor who treated you is quite powerful

148
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,279
Because in addition to pulling out drugs,

149
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,919
Beyond the fundus bruises that must be left

150
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,400
There are no sequelae left

151
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,960
Presumably, a lot of precious medicinal materials were used

152
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes

153
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,599
The doctor's apprentice asks me for money every day

154
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,520
Just want me to repay her

155
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,520
Is it

156
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,359
That's quite similar to me

157
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,239
But it's normal

158
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,799
Work like collecting herbs

159
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,359
Usually, our disciples do it

160
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,760
If it were me,

161
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,119
I'm sure I'll let you commit yourself

162
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,840
Right

163
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,840
She also said the same thing as committing herself

164
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,640
All these words have been said

165
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,520
That's quite similar to me

166
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,679
Look, you haven't committed yourself now

167
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,479
You have to give people some benefits

168
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,719
The strength of your King Palace

169
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,080
Three houses and five fields

170
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,479
It shouldn't be a big problem, should it

171
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,840
I didn't give her anything

172
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,400
Because

173
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,000
Her looks

174
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,280
Name

175
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,640
Even men and women

176
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,640
I don't even know

177
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,359
Why

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,719
You lost contact

179
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,119
Mid-Autumn Festival that year

180
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,919
She said her master brought some hairy crabs

181
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,679
Go back and bring me some

182
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,719
It never appeared again

183
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,080
Little blind man

184
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,400
Long time no see

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,520
Little money fanatic

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,880
Happy

187
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,239
Are you so happy

188
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,320
High ink

189
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,719
We do this

190
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,400
Isn't it a little inappropriate

191
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
When reinforcements arrive

192
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,679
I will double the repayment to this farmer

193
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,359
You see

194
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,559
Nice pillow, isn't it

195
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,080
Sweet potatoes are ready

196
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,960
You wait

197
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,880
I'll blow it for you

198
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,559
Why are you still wearing rouge

199
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,520
I

200
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,320
I bought it when I thought it looked good

201
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:41,880
High ink

202
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,479
Do you already know

203
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Ayue, you can rest assured

204
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,520
I won't say a word

205
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,599
I've been sleeping at night lately

206
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I sent away the boy who served me

207
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,320
I'm afraid of spilling my mouth in my dream

208
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,960
If you don't feel at ease,

209
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,400
You can poison me dumb.

210
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,119
I believe you

211
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,760
In this world

212
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,280
If I can't trust you

213
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,559
Who else can I trust

214
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,919
You come and sit down

215
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:24,520
Come here

216
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,119
You sit tight

217
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,200
I meant to ask you, you

218
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,039
Eldest brother and second brother

219
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,840
The man who stole our sweet potatoes is here

220
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,440
Big brother and second brother, look

221
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,000
Sure enough, they stole our sweet potatoes

222
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,919
Even the scarecrow was stolen

223
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,080
No wonder I lost my sweet potatoes so many times

224
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,840
I've never seen a thief

225
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,880
How dare you hide here and steal food

226
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,719
What so many times

227
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:58,599
I just took it this once

228
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,520
I saw you say it once

229
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,760
What about when I didn't see it

230
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,599
Don't you talk nonsense to me

231
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,799
Lose money quickly

232
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,280
Have no money

233
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,359
Have no money

234
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,119
There is no money to work as a coolie for us

235
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,280
Payment

236
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,320
The second and third

237
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,039
Begin

238
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,039
Can't

239
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,679
This is that we have mistakes first

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,039
How can you be rude later

241
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,159
Several big brothers

242
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,479
Today

243
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,000
The two of me are in trouble here

244
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,080
Unbearable hunger

245
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,400
Will take it without asking

246
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,400
Really shouldn't

247
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,799
Here

248
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,159
Make amends to several big brothers

249
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,000
Be rude

250
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,400
The little brother speaks quite well

251
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,440
Much better than that big fool

252
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,440
Who did you say

253
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,000
Can't

254
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,159
All right

255
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,840
We won't embarrass you today

256
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,640
But you ate our food for nothing

257
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,479
At least there must be some compensation

258
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,799
This rouge box is good

259
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,440
Go back to my wife

260
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,520
That's it

261
00:14:59,039 --> 00:14:59,200
This big brother

262
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,640
Wait

263
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Rouge can't be given to you

264
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,479
Why

265
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,119
You two gentlemen

266
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,599
What's the use of this rouge

267
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,359
Anyway, I can't give it to you

268
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,640
It

269
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
It means a lot to me

270
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,239
This is for you

271
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,359
Give me back the rouge

272
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,080
Change a box of broken rouge with jade pendant

273
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,239
We really don't understand what these people think

274
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:30,760
Go

275
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,159
Go

276
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,960
How long are you gonna stare

277
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,200
You said

278
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,599
We've known each other for so long

279
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,640
How come I never recognize it

280
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,760
You are a little blind

281
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,559
If it had been discovered earlier,

282
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,880
Will wages be halved

283
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,239
Of course not

284
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,559
If I knew

285
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,799
If I saved a little prince before,

286
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,000
It must have forced you to commit yourself to me

287
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,159
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich

288
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,200
I just missed it

289
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,520
What a pity

290
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,760
It looks good now, too

291
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,799
Zhou Yue is also a rich party

292
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,960
Yeah

293
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,119
Or say

294
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:55,280
God is actually not thin to me

295
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,000
Missed a prince

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,440
Give me back a rich Jia

297
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,679
But Zhou Yue has a weak temper

298
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,359
How can people rely on it with confidence

299
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,760
Weak is a little weak

300
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,320
But he was generous

301
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,080
It's good for me, too

302
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,840
People are very good-natured and have a good temper

303
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,159
Speak softly

304
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,559
The most important thing is to be born beautifully

305
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,960
This condition is hard to find with lanterns

306
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,039
I thought you said to marry into Zhou Fu

307
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,640
Is it to find a place to stay and overturn the verdict

308
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,520
Why do you look good now

309
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,960
I go to a restaurant for dinner

310
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,000
It depends on whether the bartender looks good or not

311
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,599
At least it is also to marry someone back

312
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,599
Let's see what's wrong with it

313
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,400
Superficial

314
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,919
What's the matter with you

315
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,919
It's faster to turn your face than to turn over a book

316
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:47,760
This big rooster

317
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,520
I didn't know Ayue was a daughter

318
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,880
I don't know that we have become sworn sisters

319
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,039
So he is

320
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,200
Be jealous

321
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,799
When it comes to my husband,

322
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,159
I really can't help but praise him a few more words

323
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,239
Ben Wang doesn't want to hear it

324
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,000
This king is sleepy

325
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,559
I'm not sleepy

326
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,119
You can not talk

327
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,359
You listen as I speak

328
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,559
My Xianggong

329
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,400
In addition to being good-looking,

330
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,320
He

331
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,719
Also learned from the past and the present

332
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,919
Be knowledgeable

333
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,280
Stop it

334
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,039
Ben Wang doesn't want to hear it

335
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,200
What? I haven't finished yet

336
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
He is really the best at everything

337
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,039
Recite poems against each other

338
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,719
Is the pride of heaven

339
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,359
Pillar of the country

340
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,160
What are you doing? What are you doing

341
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,359
I thought you wanted to say

342
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,560
Since you want to say so,

343
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,439
Can't I hear better when I get closer

344
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,119
Not so close, is it

345
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,239
Go ahead

346
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,119
Are you really in love with Zhou Yue

347
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Or say these words

348
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,599
Deliberately annoying the king

349
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,880
Of course, I fall in love with my husband

350
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,599
Is it

351
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,520
Then why

352
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,079
Until now, you haven't been married yet

353
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:22,599
What about living in separate houses

354
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,119
Yam even told you this

355
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,920
Answer the King's question

356
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,560
What

357
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,079
Are you in love with Zhou Yue

358
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,319
Or do you want it

359
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,839
Annoy me

360
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,359
To annoy you

361
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Me and Yue

362
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,319
Is the best friend

363
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:53,199
Be a bosom friend

364
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:55,839
But

365
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,239
There will be no real husband and wife

366
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,959
You'll know this later

367
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,839
Ben Wang has understood

368
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,160
There is a long way to go

369
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,319
There is no need to rush for a while

370
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,599
I'm waiting for you

371
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:39,040
From Mrs. Zhou to Princess Jing

372
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,079
It's getting late

373
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:45,760
Go to bed early

374
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:26,920
A Yue

375
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,319
You just said

376
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,239
This rouge is very important to you

377
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,319
Really

378
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,239
I just think

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,959
Can you have the heart to buy this kind of woman's thing

380
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,839
It is already rare

381
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
If it is easily handed over to others,

382
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,280
It's a pity to some extent

383
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,959
If you like it

384
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,479
I'll buy it for you in the future

385
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,000
I forgot to keep my distance again

386
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,040
A Yue

387
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,119
Presumably, your three rooms are dealing with the old lady

388
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,239
That's the best thing to do

389
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,640
So

390
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,800
You got married to hide your eyes and ears, right

391
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:19,959
Exactly

392
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,959
What if Shen Yu knows your secret

393
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,880
She is by your side every day

394
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Wouldn't it be dangerous

395
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,760
She already knows

396
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,280
But you can rest assured

397
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,079
Ah Yu, she is virtuous by nature

398
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,359
It won't hurt me

399
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,160
But you still have to be careful

400
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,920
Especially King Jing

401
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,000
In my opinion

402
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,079
The murderer is in those wooden boxes of King Jing

403
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,599
Seems

404
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Gao Mo has guessed it

405
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,760
Shall I tell him

406
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:53,359
Forget it

407
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,439
This matter involves the true identity of A Yu

408
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,079
Let's wait until everything gets to the bottom

409
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,920
After all, A Yu bears the crime of murder

410
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,920
She is anxious to investigate the case

411
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,119
I can also understand

412
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,839
Why am I not anxious to investigate the case

413
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,319
Then Cai's family is related to the Xiao Rong Wang case

414
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,040
I studied hard and got into the punishments department

415
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,560
Just to fight for the Gao family

416
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,239
The emperor's health is getting worse and worse

417
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,040
If a new imperial heir is really established,

418
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,839
Whoever ascends the throne

419
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,680
There is no room for Xiaorong Wang, an orthodox prince

420
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,160
Gaojia keeps a low profile again

421
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,640
There may not be a way to live

422
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,280
Everything will turn around

423
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,239
Rest assured

424
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,719
Gao Guifei is my aunt

425
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,760
Love me since I was a child

426
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,359
Xiao Rong Wang is my cousin

427
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,439
I look at the child every day

428
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,040
Suffer from illness

429
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,359
I hate it in my heart

430
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,079
I hate the cruelty of those people

431
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,079
Mother

432
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,079
Mother

433
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Mother, where are you

434
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,760
Mother

435
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,280
Where are you

436
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,359
Mother

437
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,239
Mother

438
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,520
Mother

439
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,199
Mother

440
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,239
Shen fish

441
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,719
Mother

442
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,760
Mother

443
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,079
What kind of suffering have you suffered

444
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,560
Will be so scared in my dreams

445
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,599
General Han

446
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:19,880
You guys

447
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,280
You let me explain

448
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
It's not what you saw

449
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,640
You don't have to explain to me

450
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,520
Turn back

451
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,280
Just explain it to Zhou Yue

452
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,239
Isn't that right, Your Highness

453
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,400
Cut the crap

454
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,040
Is there an ambush on this road

455
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,479
They're not too stupid

456
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,520
Catch up with me

457
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,520
But I'm unharmed

458
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,239
I brought it back to you

459
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,800
Thank you, General Han, for your tireless efforts

460
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,280
If you hadn't taken Jilu away in advance,

461
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,719
He must have fallen into the hands of the enemy

462
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,439
Or is it a little lady? I love to hear it

463
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,119
What's the matter

464
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,119
What's going on

465
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,959
It's a beautiful road

466
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,800
How could he be frozen stiff

467
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,599
It's not freezing

468
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:00,760
Is poisoned

469
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,040
Poisoning

470
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,079
My fault

471
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,079
Little Lady

472
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,719
What kind of poison is he in

473
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,839
If I guess correctly,

474
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,160
It should be lost for a long time in rivers and lakes

475
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,880
Yin Soul Yang Spirit Poison

476
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:22,719
What kind of poison is this

477
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,280
It is a poison from yin to yang

478
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,439
After poisoning

479
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,599
There is no cure

480
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:28,959
There is no cure

481
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,280
I've only heard a little about it

482
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,319
According to legend

483
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,439
Poisoned by ghosts

484
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,719
Will be eroded by cold

485
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,439
Frost to death

486
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,959
And those who are poisoned by Yang Po

487
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,479
Will be transpirated by hot air

488
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,479
Die ripe

489
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,160
Look at him like this

490
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,680
It should be ghost poison

491
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:42,880
Who the hell is it

492
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,599
To prevent me from reversing my conviction

493
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,119
I can't believe I even used this poison

494
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,439
Don't worry

495
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,079
Yin Soul Yang Spirit

496
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,000
It is necessary to refine together to exert the greatest effect

497
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,719
They are both mutually reinforcing and mutually exclusive

498
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,479
If we can find Yang Spirit Poison

499
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,760
Should be able to detoxify him

500
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,760
The process of refining these two poisons

501
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
It's tedious and complicated

502
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,239
A slight carelessness

503
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,280
You will be killed instantly

504
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,680
Who on earth is it

505
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,800
Would be so desperate

506
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,479
Refine this poison

507
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,040
He Guang

508
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,520
He Guang is a doctor

509
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,319
How can this evil medical skill come about

510
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,160
He Guang before taking care of his family

511
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,520
Used to be a witch doctor in Jianghu

512
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,479
Was later led in the right direction by my father

513
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,160
That's it

514
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,479
But the drugs needed to refine these two poisons

515
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,479
They are the best in the world

516
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,800
Whether it's a thousand days drunk orchid,

517
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,079
Or the Millennium Meat Buddha

518
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,640
It's hard to find thousands of dollars

519
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
Even in Tai Hospital

520
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,119
You can't get in touch with it

521
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,000
Except for him

522
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,439
Who else will there be

523
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,880
Who else can there be

524
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:43,839
It's King Ning

525
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,319
Are you saying

526
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,319
The man behind He Guang

527
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:55,959
It's King Ning

528
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:57,959
Yes

529
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
King Ning intends to fight for power

530
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,239
He Guang is attached to Ning Wang

531
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,520
If He Guang made the Xiaorongwang case,

532
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,560
The purpose is to make it a place in the hospital of Tai Hospital

533
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,359
King Na Ning

534
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,400
The morgue attacked regardless of the armor

535
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,680
What King Ning wants is power

536
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,199
Then you were assassinated several times

537
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,239
Is it also because of the royal struggle for power

538
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,040
Do you also intend to compete for storage space

539
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,719
If I intend to compete for reserves,

540
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:35,599
Will I come to this backcountry with you?

541
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,040
Right, too

542
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,000
Quickly

543
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,520
How is it

544
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,560
The toxin has spread to the whole body

545
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,640
I use the family holographic needle method

546
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,280
Temporarily suppressed the spread of toxins

547
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,959
But if there is no antidote,

548
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,199
Daluo immortal can't save him either

549
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:18,640
Occipital cloud

550
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,160
Arrange to return to Beijing immediately

551
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:20,880
Yes

552
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,160
Rest assured

553
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,079
There must be a way

554
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:46,479
My Lord, spare my life, my Lord

555
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,079
Animal

556
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,040
Father

557
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,040
Step down

558
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,079
Yes

559
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,160
About Jilu

560
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,239
It can be done properly

561
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,359
Father rest assured

562
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,520
Najilu has been poisoned by ghosts

563
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,359
No matter how big Shen Yu is,

564
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:13,640
I can't return to heaven

565
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,680
Very good

566
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,000
Thanks to you this time

567
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,119
Put forward this poisoning suggestion to Ning Wang

568
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,400
You bet

569
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,239
Since you can't grab it, it's the same if you kill it

570
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:25,319
My daughter is afraid to take credit

571
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,880
Everything depends on my father

572
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,319
Exquisite medicine refining skills

573
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
I don't know next time

574
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,560
Can my daughter participate in medicine refining together

575
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,520
Visit study

576
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:34,800
In no hurry

577
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,680
In no hurry

578
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,119
I'll look at the herbs first

579
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,000
See you gentlemen

580
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,760
What are we doing stopping here

581
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,479
Why don't you just go back to the punishments department

582
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,079
Waiting for King of Scenery

583
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,640
Waiting for King of Scenery

584
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,359
If it is true as he said

585
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,479
Those boxes

586
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,959
There are only some specialties and treasures

587
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,439
This Shen Yu loves money again

588
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,280
You don't have to lay down your life to protect each other

589
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,040
I thought about it carefully

590
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,479
King Jing and Shen Yu along the way

591
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,319
There are too many anomalies

592
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,560
The only thing that can be explained

593
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,959
It was they who took the lead in finding Jilu

594
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,400
If this is the case

595
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,079
It's outrageous

596
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,079
Then you wouldn't be so angry.

597
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,079
Of course as for ah

598
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,479
If they do find Jilu,

599
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,520
How could you not tell us

600
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,000
You and I narrowly escaped death to find clues

601
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,079
You almost died

602
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:48,359
This is clearly whether you or me live or die

603
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,959
It is not necessarily no matter

604
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,800
Fortunately, between you and me

605
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,560
There is no concealment

606
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,239
Anyway

607
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,319
Let's go back to the punishments department first

608
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,079
No return

609
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,160
I'm going to arrest them

610
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,800
See how they face us

611
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:28,800
What's the matter

612
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,439
Xiao Xianggong

613
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,880
They came back first

614
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,479
Look at Gao Mo's eyes

615
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,719
Needless to come

616
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,239
Fool him all the way

617
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,359
I must have reacted

618
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,520
It's not too stupid

619
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,319
Xianggong

620
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:55,760
Xianggong

621
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,520
Are you all right? Are you hurt

622
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,359
I'm okay

623
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,040
What about you

624
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,880
Are you hurt

625
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,479
I'm fine, too

626
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,599
That day we were dispersed by killers

627
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,199
I've been worried about your safety

628
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,319
Don't worry

629
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,199
My life is hard

630
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:10,880
That

631
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,359
Have you brought it

632
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:16,000
Bring

633
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,040
It just didn't turn out very well

634
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,640
His Royal Highness King Jing

635
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,319
Gao received a secret order from the Criminal Department

636
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,160
Said Jilu was by His Royal Highness

637
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,760
Back to Beijing

638
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,560
In this case

639
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,800
Let's give it to Gao

640
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,800
What kind of joke are tall people talking about

641
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,439
This king left Liangxian County with tall people

642
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,839
Why do you say that Jilu is in the hands of our king now

643
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,680
Your Highness

644
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,280
You and I are both seven-foot men

645
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,319
Don't beat around the bush when you talk

646
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,719
Being and not being

647
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,079
Let Gao confirm it

648
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,880
High ink

649
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,119
This king is a clan king

650
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,560
You have tried to search Ben Wang's horses and chariots for three transgressions and five times

651
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:01,920
Really thought

652
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,680
Will Ben Wang take care of Gao's face and dare not touch you

653
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,479
Your Highness doesn't have to

654
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,839
Always press people with their identities

655
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,439
If there is no hiding

656
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,040
Why stop it

657
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,319
If the king insists on blocking it,

658
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,760
What do tall people plan to do with them

659
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,719
Tall man

660
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,880
Look at the people coming and going around here

661
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,560
It's not a good place to discuss things

662
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,839
Why don't we go into the city

663
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,199
You already know that, don't you

664
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,000
Tall man

665
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,839
His affairs have a wide range of implications

666
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,520
If you enter the punishments department,

667
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I'm afraid I'll die

668
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,719
So to be on the safe side

669
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,439
Let's go to the advanced Jingwangfu

670
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
How should I know

671
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,280
What kind of tricks will you play

672
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,239
Since it's a suspect

673
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,360
Naturally, it should be handled by the punishments department

674
00:35:59,199 --> 00:35:59,560
Search

675
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
All consequences

676
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,439
I will bear it all

677
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,320
Yes

678
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:07,719
Presumptuous

679
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,959
Gao Mo, stop it

680
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,120
Jilu is involved in the case of Xiaorongwang

681
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,879
Your Highness, they don't tell you

682
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,479
I'm afraid you'll get emotional and make trouble

683
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,520
You know about this

684
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:26,919
I

685
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,040
You're with them keeping secrets from me

686
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,320
High ink

687
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,679
This is a big matter

688
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,360
I dare not reveal it easily

689
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,639
At the end of the day

690
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,320
You still don't trust me

691
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,120
Sure

692
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,639
All of you are smart and wise

693
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,879
Just me

694
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
Stupid and silly

695
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,280
You deserve to be kept in the dark

696
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,919
It serves you right. It's like a joke

697
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,239
To dig a grave

698
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,360
High ink

699
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,879
I thought we lived and died together

700
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,479
Even if there is disagreement

701
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,280
But all roads lead to the same goal

702
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:15,639
I think too much

703
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,159
High ink

704
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,439
I

705
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,479
Live in Jingwangfu

706
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,239
Isn't it appropriate

707
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,639
My husband said he would find me a place to live

708
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,280
In your present situation

709
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,959
Do you think your husband can protect you

710
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,719
Jingwangfu is heavily guarded

711
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,439
You're under my nose

712
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,239
I can rest assured

713
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,560
So is this a place to live

714
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,280
Where's Jilu

715
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,159
It's arranged properly

716
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,520
Don't worry

717
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:54,760
Ji Lu is in the secret room

718
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,320
You can see anytime you want

719
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:58,919
Go inside

720
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,760
A Le

721
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,399
Sister

722
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,199
That's great

723
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,639
I finally see you again

724
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,120
Are you all right

725
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,239
You don't know

726
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,879
When you were buried alive

727
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,239
I'm afraid I can't save you

728
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,639
Am I standing right in front of you

729
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:26,959
Why are you here

730
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,080
After your accident

731
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,239
Your Highness has always sent someone to protect me

732
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,000
Yesterday

733
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,520
He sent someone to pick me up

734
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
I just realized that you were going back to Beijing

735
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:37,360
How is it

736
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,760
This time out of Beijing

737
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,840
Is there any progress

738
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,560
Sort of

739
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,120
It's not true, is it

740
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,199
You come

741
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:46,159
I'll tell you slowly

742
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:46,639
Good

743
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,560
It turns out that behind this

744
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,199
It also involves King Ning

745
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:56,399
The only witness is now on the line

746
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,000
Heavenly injustice

747
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,439
Let me take care of my family and never get over it

748
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:02,800
Why don't we visit the palace at night

749
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
Steal Yang Poison

750
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,719
It's simple to say

751
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,199
Ning Wangfu is heavily guarded with iron walls

752
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,239
Archers patrol day and night

753
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:14,760
I'm afraid we didn't steal anything

754
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
It's already a sieve

755
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,479
There is no way out

756
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,760
Our family is full of sufferings

757
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,919
We sisters can all survive

758
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,879
This time

759
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:30,320
It will be no problem

760
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:39,679
No

761
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,639
It's too risky to do so

762
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,959
This is the only way to save Jilu

763
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,120
Qi Mao is different to you

764
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:47,800
But he is a dude after all

765
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,199
How can you take romantic feelings seriously

766
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,479
You want to use him to steal Yang Poison

767
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,679
In case they are found out

768
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,040
You will die

769
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,879
Anyway

770
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,120
I also want to spell a chance

771
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,560
Why are you so stubborn in your family

772
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,199
Does your highness have a better way

773
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,800
Jilu is at stake

774
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,280
If he really dies,

775
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,320
There is no possibility of reversing the case for the family

776
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,239
They can kill Jilu

777
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,120
You can kill me and sister as well

778
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:16,840
No

779
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,560
You can't go without a perfect solution

780
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:19,959
Your Highness

781
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:21,560
Time waits for no man

782
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,959
I disagree

783
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:25,000
Sister

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,479
A Le

785
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,439
This is not a matter when we were young

786
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,600
It's as simple as playing house

787
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,919
A matter of human life

788
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
You have a new identity

789
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,600
Just live your new life

790
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,080
Don't get involved in this matter

791
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,760
Sister

792
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,320
I'm just like you

793
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,280
The purpose of living

794
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,199
Just to dispel the haze and see the sky

795
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,439
To clear the grievances for the family

796
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,080
Gu Jia always stays behind

797
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:56,800
I can't risk you

798
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,080
Sister

799
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:00,919
You and I are both the same

800
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,399
Better to die than to live in peace

801
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,360
If there is no possibility of reversing the case for the family,

802
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:08,879
You and I will never live in the world

803
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,760
Rather than this

804
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,479
Why don't we give it a try

805
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:15,879
Just

806
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,360
Let her have a try

807
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,600
This is the only way at present

808
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:20,959
Rest assured

809
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,439
There is Ben Wang around

810
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:24,919
She should be all right

811
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,639
I found out

812
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,080
King Ning goes to court with Qi Lian every day

813
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,280
Shen Shi will come back

814
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,439
I use this time

815
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,879
Let Qi Mao take me into the mansion

816
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,199
I'm going
