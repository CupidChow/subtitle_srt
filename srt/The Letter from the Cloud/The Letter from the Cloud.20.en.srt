1
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,800
Stand down from this palace

2
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,120
Yu Er

3
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:15,680
Bearer

4
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Shen Yu murdered the prince and immediately took it down

5
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,919
Yes

6
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,559
Drag down

7
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,320
Go

8
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:20,759
Yu Er

9
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,160
A fish

10
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,160
Yu Er

11
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,439
Empress

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Imperial concubine empress forgives

13
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,239
The whole father-in-law stays

14
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I am also quite familiar with this palace

15
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,200
Don't bother to see my father-in-law off

16
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,160
Yes

17
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,640
The emperor also ordered

18
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,399
In your highness's spare time

19
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,960
You can walk around this palace

20
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,039
The atmosphere of this imperial garden is quite warm

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,399
So the flowers bloom earlier here than elsewhere

22
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,560
I never liked these enchanting flowers

23
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,359
But sweet-scented osmanthus is elegant

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,719
It's quite to my liking

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,639
Something unfortunate happened

26
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,880
The emperor doesn't like the smell of sweet-scented osmanthus

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,999
Therefore, there is no sweet-scented osmanthus fragrance in this palace

28
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,359
This is rather a pity

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Then again

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,959
Old slave vaguely remembers in this palace

31
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,240
There seems to be a sweet-scented osmanthus tree in the early years

32
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,039
It seems to be in the southwest

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,359
A long time

34
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,439
Forgive the old slave for not remembering

35
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,679
Your Highness, forgive me

36
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:21,800
No harm

37
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,999
It seems that it is quite interesting for flowers to bloom

38
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,079
I will walk around this royal garden alone

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,520
The old slave retired first

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,200
All wins have always been watertight

41
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,920
Why did you tell me where my mother and concubine are today

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Let's talk to our mother first

43
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,080
It is quiet and quiet here, and few people come

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,679
If the mother is really imprisoned in the palace,

45
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,440
This is really a suitable place

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,039
Your Highness

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,360
Your Highness

48
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,599
What is it

49
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,319
Something happened to your highness

50
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,720
Empress

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,959
Please allow me to take two more injections

52
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,799
I must find a way to revive His Royal Highness

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,280
You give me another chance

54
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
Empress

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,679
The old minister has practiced medicine for decades

56
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,720
Never seen it before

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,560
The girl's healing technique just now

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,519
It's not like saving people

59
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,280
It's like killing people.

60
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,840
Empress and minister have also heard a rumor

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,679
Said that this Shen Yu is a daughter who cares for her parents

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,679
If that's the case

63
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,000
The family did not murder your highness in those days

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,280
Now, the same skill can be re-applied, and the heart can be punished

65
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
You spit out blood

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,480
If I had the intention of murdering your highness,

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,319
Just let him fend for himself

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,879
Why in front of everyone

69
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,879
Adventure needles

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
As a great doctor, you watched your little highness suffer

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,159
And from ruin

72
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,000
You are really unforgivable sins, aren't you

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,840
That's enough

74
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,799
Drag Shen Yu down and put him to death

75
00:04:59,239 --> 00:04:59,840
Empress

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,759
Empress

77
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,959
A fish is never harmless to the heart of Xiao Rong Wang

78
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,720
Please give her another chance, empress

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,640
Aunt calms her anger

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,280
She meant well not to die

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,440
I hope my aunt will be merciful

82
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,519
Drag down

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,759
Mother

84
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,159
Stop

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,239
King of Scenery

86
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,200
Empress

87
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,480
Shen Yu's guilt should also be handed over to the Punishment Department and Dali Temple

88
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,560
It's not up to the empress to dispose of it personally

89
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,879
King Jing, as a vassal king, you broke into the inner palace privately

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,480
This is a capital crime

91
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,199
It is up to the emperor to decide whether to die or not

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,280
Empress Shen Yu can't be killed

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
Why not

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,760
Originally, I still have breath

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,359
But after she took the needle, her breath was interrupted and her pulse was completely lost

96
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,880
She killed my son

97
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,880
I must bury her with me

98
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
Your Highness may not be dead yet

99
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
Would you let me try it again

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440
Why should I trust you

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,280
Empress, you delay one more moment

102
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,280
Yu'er will have less vitality

103
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,440
What if she can't be saved

104
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,399
This king is willing to trade his life for his life

105
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,799
Move

106
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,040
Yu Er

107
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,600
Yu Er

108
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,639
Wake up, little highness. Wake up

109
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,239
You scared my mother to death

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,760
You finally woke up, Yu'er

111
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,600
The old slave said according to the emperor's orders

112
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,639
There used to be a sweet-scented osmanthus in the palace

113
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
As for whether it can be found, it depends on your highness

114
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:14,600
You won't let me tell him

115
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,199
Then let him find it himself

116
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,720
Emperor

117
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,560
Is there anything else

118
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,120
Rong'an Palace reports

119
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,679
His Royal Highness's body seems to be ominous

120
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,479
Afraid it is

121
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,519
Can't get past today

122
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,880
Have all the doctors gone

123
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:49,639
All the words back to the emperor are over

124
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,440
But I don't know why the Shen fish is there

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,840
The old slave also heard that His Royal Highness King Jing wanted to protect her

126
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
Hard to break into the imperial concubine's bedroom

127
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,440
Your Majesty, would you like to go over and have a look

128
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,760
It's the sinking fish again

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,079
Forget it. I won't go

130
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,799
Yu'er's body and bones will die sooner or later

131
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,679
If I go at this time

132
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,359
Zhang Er's hard rush into the harem

133
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,320
Then sit down

134
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,840
I

135
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,760
Don't want to lose two sons at the same time

136
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,760
Why did the Imperial Concubine Empress bring Shen Yu into the palace

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,639
Heard

138
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,280
It was the time when the empress gave Zhou Yue his death

139
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,520
Shen Yu was also present

140
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,080
Just in time for your little highness's illness

141
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
I brought it into the palace together

142
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,880
I told you so long ago

143
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,520
Don't act rashly about Zhou Yue's identity

144
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,320
Pour it now

145
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,400
Let Shen Yu visit Xiao Rong Wang

146
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,880
In case something goes wrong

147
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,799
What's the problem

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,599
In short

149
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,679
Don't be so foolish and reckless in doing things in the future

150
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
It's my daughter who remembers it

151
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,359
What does the imperial concubine want to do when she leaves Ah Yu

152
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,039
Will you kill her again

153
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Xiao Rong Wang has woken up

154
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,760
The imperial concubine also promised the king to calm down

155
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,479
Fish will be fine

156
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,039
Your Highness

157
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,039
You broke into the inner palace for the fish

158
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,080
If it is known by people with heart,

159
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,120
I'm afraid it's another storm

160
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,719
Gao Guifei invited outsiders to see Xiao Rong Wang

161
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,479
Against the holy will

162
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
She won't mention today's events to outsiders

163
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,679
As for He's father and daughter

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,919
As a great doctor

165
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,839
Medical skills are not as good as Jianghu medical women

166
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,880
What face do you have to mention today's events

167
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,159
And feel at ease

168
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,279
As long as Ah Yu comes back safely today

169
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,640
We passed another hurdle

170
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,880
You should really be the daughter of Gu's survival

171
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:16,919
What would I do if I were an empress

172
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,919
Kill me to vent my hatred

173
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,799
You have seen today's events

174
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,479
I can't even control my own bedroom

175
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,799
Who can I kill again

176
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,320
His Royal Highness, Empress King, he is today

177
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,960
No need to explain

178
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,960
There are no pet concubines in my palace

179
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,479
The prince is weak and sick

180
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,039
What kind of grievances have you never suffered

181
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,200
As long as my Yu'er is safe

182
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,320
None of this matters

183
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,960
Empress rest assured

184
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,960
I have temporarily suppressed it

185
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,520
Toxins in His Royal Highness

186
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,239
He is safe for the time being

187
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,279
You just

188
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,719
How can you be sure to save Yu Er

189
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,039
I carefully observed the little royal highness's face

190
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,640
If it's really because of eating moon seeds by mistake,

191
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,960
Then your highness should have a purple complexion

192
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
But he looks normal

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Besides, insufficient amount of moon seeds will not die

194
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,159
Then why on earth is this happening

195
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,919
Because your little highness's body

196
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,919
There is another chronic poison

197
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Poison

198
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,400
This poison does not kill people immediately

199
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,120
On the contrary, it will hurt people's hearts over time

200
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,039
Eventually, the qi declines and exhausts

201
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,919
And moon seed kernel

202
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,479
It happens to cause suffocation and paralysis

203
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,880
The two collided

204
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,719
Eventually catalyzed the little highness

205
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,960
The onset of toxins in the body

206
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,960
There is such a thing

207
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a waste of my staying with Yu Er day by day

208
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,359
I didn't know he had already been killed

209
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,560
Empress

210
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,200
I just suppressed it for a while

211
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,760
Toxins in His Royal Highness

212
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,760
As for what kind of poison this is, how to solve it

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,039
I don't know yet

214
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,919
My palace can't lose Yu'er

215
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,200
Please, you must find a way to save him

216
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,919
Empress rest assured

217
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,640
This matter concerns my family

218
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,919
Even if it's not what the empress wants

219
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,479
I will do my best, too

220
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,039
Who is so cruel

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
To drive our mother and son to a dead end

222
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,760
Understand pharmacology

223
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,520
And can get close to your highness

224
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,919
How many people does the empress think there are in the palace

225
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,239
You mean the He family

226
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,479
But he is already the hospital ambassador of Taiyuan Hospital

227
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,839
What is the reason for murdering the emperor's heir

228
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
It depends on who is behind him

229
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,320
It's them

230
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,120
Power doomed love, the struggle between them

231
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,760
Why do you want my Yu'er to suffer

232
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,919
What does the empress mean by this statement

233
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,479
Do you have any other guesses about the events of that year

234
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,679
It doesn't matter whether you have it or not

235
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
As long as she is here one day

236
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,919
Neither Yu'er nor I will be treated fairly

237
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,599
Love sweet-scented osmanthus is full of frost in the garden

238
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,039
Emperor

239
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,239
Do you want everyone

240
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,000
Do you all have to be buried for your love

241
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,599
As long as she is here one day

242
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,679
Neither Yu'er nor I will be treated fairly

243
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,039
Love sweet-scented osmanthus is full of frost in the garden

244
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,279
Emperor

245
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,479
Do you want everyone

246
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:36,520
Do you all have to be buried for your love

247
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,960
What does Gao Guifei mean by this

248
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,279
Who is she referring to

249
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,560
What is good about their Zhou women

250
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,479
It is worth your willingness to give everything one by one

251
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,120
Who else is there in the Zhou family

252
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,479
This is my mother's room

253
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,520
Princess Zhou You of Xianjing

254
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,400
Princess Zhou You of Xianjing

255
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,320
Is the anecdotal rumor true

256
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,799
The emperor and Zhou You were childhood sweethearts

257
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,159
In order to secure the throne,

258
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,239
And married Gao Guifei, the daughter of a powerful minister

259
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,000
That's why Gao Guifei hated the Zhou family

260
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,919
Hate Ah Yue

261
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,120
But Princess Xianjing

262
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Didn't he die years ago

263
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:16,000
Take a detour to Beijing as a captaincy

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,080
Take me as a secret to check the Zhou family

265
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,400
Try your best to live in Zhouhou Mansion

266
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,839
Your Highness, what is your secret

267
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,039
How to do it is my business

268
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,839
Are you interested in storing space

269
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,479
If I intend to compete for reserves,

270
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,039
Will I come to this backcountry with you

271
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,880
Asthma caused by sweet-scented osmanthus powder allergy

272
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,760
This is just a volume of ordinary imperial secretary's pulse case

273
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,080
But why doesn't this imperial secretary have a name

274
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,120
Record it in the pulse case of the royal family

275
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,400
Is Princess Xianjing still alive

276
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,719
And it's inside this palace

277
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,200
So the real purpose of Qi Zhang's coming to Beijing

278
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,679
Just to find his mother

279
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,799
Girl

280
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,320
You see, this is going to the palace gate soon

281
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,679
I won't bother the girl to see me off

282
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,359
How can that work

283
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,560
The imperial concubine confessed to send the young lady out of the palace

284
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Besides, there are rules in this palace

285
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,479
Yes, I know there are rules

286
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,719
Be honest

287
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,560
One of the palace gate guards is my big nephew

288
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,719
What about me? I want to tell him something personal at home

289
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,080
I wonder if you could be accommodating

290
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,839
Then you have to go quickly when you finish speaking

291
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,279
You can't run around

292
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,200
I would never

293
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,799
If I don't run around, my money won't be wasted

294
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,159
Don't say it

295
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,799
The material in this palace is good

296
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,200
The pulse case says she is allergic to sweet-scented osmanthus

297
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,919
It means that

298
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,159
The place where she lives should be without sweet-scented osmanthus

299
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,280
There is not a single sweet-scented osmanthus in this whole palace

300
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,520
Where can I find it here

301
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,680
Princess Xianjing is allergic to sweet-scented osmanthus

302
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,400
Imperial preference

303
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,839
That's why there is no osmanthus tree in the palace

304
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,359
It just proves that she is in the palace

305
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,920
But where would she be

306
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Orchid

307
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,680
If I help Qi Zhang find his mother,

308
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,640
He must be very happy

309
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,880
Your Highness, there is one thing I have never known

310
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,160
What is it

311
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,160
You can risk your life again and again for the sake of the fish

312
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
But why do you want to marry Yi Hui

313
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,839
Divine will is difficult to disobey

314
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,359
The Northwest King I know drinks blood

315
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,479
Be fearless in times of danger

316
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,439
Never lose your heart because of an imperial edict

317
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,359
It's just

318
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
A Yu's feelings for your highness

319
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,719
Your Highness only saw the tip of the iceberg

320
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,160
A fish

321
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,439
It must be very sad

322
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,079
Zhou Yue said so much today

323
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,120
I don't want to interfere with your highness

324
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,199
I just hope that if your highness really has difficulties

325
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,559
You can share it with A Yu

326
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,920
Maybe she's more afraid

327
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,439
It's a difference from your highness

328
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:44,920
Zhou Yue

329
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,160
Promising to marry is just an expedient measure

330
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,000
This king assures you

331
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,199
I will find a way to break off my marriage

332
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,040
Never live up to Ah Yu

333
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,239
A Yu will be very happy to know that

334
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,120
Is Zhang Er still in the palace

335
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,880
Should have left

336
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,280
It is said that today, your highness

337
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,160
Hard to break into Gao Guifei's bedroom

338
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,479
Why is that

339
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,359
When Xiao Rong Wang was critically ill,

340
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,760
A medical woman came to the rescue

341
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,040
Your Highness is rushing today

342
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,280
I heard that it is related to this medical woman

343
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,120
The whole palace belongs to this orchid with the strongest flavor

344
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,760
It's surrounded by high walls again

345
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,800
If there is no more

346
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,079
I'm really going home

347
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,040
For a healer

348
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,079
Who are you

349
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,640
Why are you here

350
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,000
Who are you

351
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,199
Who are you guys

352
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,719
You trespassed

353
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,520
That's enough

354
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,120
You go down first

355
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,920
Then leave you alone

356
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,439
No harm

357
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,239
Go down

358
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,920
What are you looking for

359
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Routine inspection

360
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,079
Patrol

361
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,120
I've been in the palace for years

362
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,000
Haven't heard of it yet

363
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,319
There are little eunuchs to take part in the inspection

364
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:38,439
And

365
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:42,319
And came out from there to inspect

366
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,599
Is that what you don't know

367
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,199
This is an unusual place in the palace

368
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,800
And this is where the emperor's concubines live

369
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,839
The safety of the palace is the top priority

370
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,800
So, ouchi's bodyguard is in Ming

371
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,160
We're in the dark

372
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,959
It turns out to be like this

373
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,880
It seems that I am ignorant

374
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,959
It's not too late to know

375
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,479
Do you know that this palace

376
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,839
Which concubines live in

377
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,160
Why are the four high walls so hidden

378
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,520
There are no concubines living here

379
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,120
Just some old palace people without positions

380
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm just not disturbed here

381
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,640
Would you like to show me around

382
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:40,920
Sure

383
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,319
Aunt

384
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,920
In which palace did you serve before

385
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,559
Queen Mother

386
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,760
Trying to lie to me again

387
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,559
Before I heard that the Queen Mother died,

388
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,479
Release the elderly palace people in the palace with grace

389
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,439
How can you live here in order to accumulate yin blessings

390
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,920
Ordinary imperial servants not only eat and wear as much as concubines

391
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,120
There is also a dark guard to protect the side at all times

392
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,400
I don't know what imperial secretary can be treated like this

393
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,959
Yi Yao's daughter is really intelligent

394
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,760
Who is Yiyao

395
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,880
Please also ask Princess Jing to express it

396
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,079
I heard that today's King of Yongzhou

397
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,000
However, I have not yet married in the year of crown

398
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,359
Where does Princess Jing say

399
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,839
The princess in this scene is not the princess in another scene

400
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,479
You're talking about his wife

401
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm talking about his mother

402
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,559
Then how do you know I'm his mother

403
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,079
Can make the emperor obsessed to this day

404
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,880
Have such beauty

405
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,280
Look at the whole palace

406
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,760
I'm afraid there aren't many people

407
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,239
A woman's appearance is too high

408
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,040
Sometimes it's a curse, not a blessing

409
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,800
Human nature

410
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,520
Which hero doesn't favor beauty

411
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,280
That's right

412
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,000
I heard King Jing today

413
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,160
Desperate to protect a medical woman

414
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,520
Breaking into Gao Guifei's bedroom

415
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,199
Looks like King Jing

416
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,160
Is also a preference for beauty

417
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,239
He prefers beauty. What do you see me do

418
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,040
His beauty is Zhou Yihui

419
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,479
Is it

420
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,760
But I haven't heard

421
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,359
What did King Jing do for Zhou Yihui

422
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:49,719
Xu

423
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Maybe the doctor's life experience is miserable

424
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,640
King Jing can't bear it

425
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:58,160
According to what you mean,

426
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,640
That King Jing told this medical girl

427
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,079
Only pity

428
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,880
It's not true

429
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,520
How should I know

430
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,719
I'm not his mother

431
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,280
I don't know what he thinks

432
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,839
I'm his mother. I know

433
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:25,559
Say so

434
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,959
You are really King Jing's mother

435
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,400
Isn't that what you see through

436
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,400
To force the dark guard to show up

437
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,559
I just don't think you look like an ordinary palace man

438
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,839
But I didn't think you were

439
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,839
Is his mother

440
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,479
Just now, I had to be in love

441
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,559
If you have offended, please ask the princess to forgive you

442
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,640
Don't be formal

443
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,760
In the eyes of the world

444
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,160
I have indeed passed away for many years

445
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,479
It's really in this palace

446
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,640
Just like other imperial officials

447
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,400
That

448
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,680
Why do you know my mother

449
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,439
Yongding Houfu and your family are old friends

450
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,760
I play small

451
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,439
I knew your mother

452
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,120
We are young

453
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:14,680
Your brow is very similar to your mother's

454
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,199
Plus

455
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,040
I heard about it today

456
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,040
Zhang Er desperately protected a medical woman

457
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,920
Presumably

458
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,359
Is that the healer girl you

459
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,800
Qi Zhang went thousands of miles to find you

460
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,120
But you are in the palace. Why don't you meet him

461
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,160
I am a mother

462
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,079
Can't shine in person

463
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,959
I have been guilty for a long time

464
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,599
Now

465
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,280
But put Zhang Er

466
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,120
Also involved in the whirlpool of this competition for storage

467
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,079
What face do I have

468
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:02,120
Facing Zhang Er

469
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,599
You didn't even ask him. Maybe he didn't care

470
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,680
I care

471
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,439
As a mother, I care

472
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,280
If

473
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,359
Zhang Er knows that I am still in the palace

474
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,120
What will happen to him

475
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:18,640
He will ask the emperor for important people

476
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,479
What if the emperor refuses

477
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,479
Girl

478
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,520
Promise me

479
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,559
Help me persuade Zhang Er

480
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,800
Return to Yongzhou immediately

481
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,439
Never set foot in the capital again

482
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,280
Zhou You is dead

483
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,680
Don't be persistent

484
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,160
He is now engaged to marriage

485
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,520
Even without you

486
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,880
There is also his unmarried wife here

487
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,839
I'm just an outsider

488
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:00,280
I don't think he will listen to me

489
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,120
You are wrong

490
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:04,559
He will

491
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,000
You just have to go back to Yongzhou with him

492
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,640
He must agree

493
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,000
I

494
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,439
Do you know that

495
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,520
Why did Zhang Er promise to benefit according to the Covenant

496
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:34,959
Zhang Er

497
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,959
Alone since childhood

498
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,199
He is quick at things and slow at words

499
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,479
I was expecting

500
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
His matter

501
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
I must have kept my mouth shut to you

502
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,680
First, I am afraid that you will blame yourself

503
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,160
Second, I am afraid that my feelings will be difficult for me

504
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,920
Although I am with Zhang Er,

505
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,559
Separate for many years

506
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,439
But he is my son after all

507
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
I know him

508
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,559
This matter

509
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:04,599
He has put life and death at risk

510
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,199
What he's done for you

511
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,040
It means that

512
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,439
How much he cares about you

513
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,400
He accepted the gift of marriage

514
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,839
Because it's about your life

515
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,079
Zhang Er has lost his parents since he was a child

516
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,400
If you don't understand him again

517
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,239
Be resentful of him

518
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,400
Then my poor Zhang Er

519
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,000
In this world

520
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,120
It's even more lonely

521
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,640
You sacrificed so much for me

522
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,640
All I care about is getting angry

523
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:47,719
Complain, satirize and satirize

524
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,160
Never put yourself in your shoes

525
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
I thought about you

526
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,479
This kind of me

527
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,120
How is it worth it

528
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,319
You lay down your life for me time and time again

529
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,160
Stop

530
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,959
Which palace eunuch are you

531
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,319
I don't know the inner court of the palace

532
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,439
Can't you walk around at will

533
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,439
A fish

534
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,640
Qi Zhang

535
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,479
This king didn't ask you to

536
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,680
Are you waiting at the entrance of the royal study

537
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:14,800
Why are you here

538
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,079
Come here quickly

539
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,959
His Royal Highness King Jing

540
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:22,120
This is a domestic slave who grew up in the northwest

541
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,199
Never seen the world

542
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,319
It is estimated that the palace is magnificent

543
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,400
Want to see more eyes

544
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,160
It doesn't affect your duty, does it

545
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,800
As a person in the mansion of His Royal Highness King Jing,

546
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,880
I'll stop interrupting later

547
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:33,719
Go

548
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,359
Are you all right

549
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,160
I thought you said you were gone. Why are you here again

550
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:45,880
This king is outside the palace

551
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,719
I'm worried about you when I see you late

552
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:54,640
You cried

553
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,000
What just happened

554
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,520
Nothing

555
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,479
Let's go home

556
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,000
It's outrageous

557
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,760
Shen Yu dared to see Qi Yu

558
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,599
This is cutting our way

559
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm going to take someone to kill her

560
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,280
Isn't this not optimistic yet

561
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,559
Panic about what

562
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,319
Not Dad

563
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,680
It will be too late when he is cured

564
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,319
Not the emperor's own son

565
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,479
The throne

566
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,479
What else can we do

567
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Xiao Rong Wang has been poisoned for many years

568
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:51,880
It is no easy task to completely cure

569
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,680
What worries me most at present is the remnant of caring for my family

570
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,559
In case she finds out

571
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,239
Vines in Xiaorong King

572
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,400
I thought you said the poison was colorless and tasteless

573
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,199
Is it imperceptible

574
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:07,559
Of course, ordinary doctors can't detect it

575
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,479
That's why we've been working for so many years

576
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,760
Xiao Rong Wang just looks weaker and weaker

577
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,359
There is no poisoning

578
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,680
It's just

579
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,520
It's just the remnants of caring for the family

580
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,160
Study medicine with a Jianghu expert

581
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,719
I'm afraid there's a chance

582
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,599
It seems that

583
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,400
We have to prepare ahead of time

584
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:45,880
Why don't you eat

585
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,400
I thought you said you wanted to see the taste of the cook in Wangfu

586
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,359
Have you been thinking about it for a long time

587
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,880
I mean to you

588
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,680
What kind of person is it

589
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,199
Why do you ask this all of a sudden

590
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,479
What about you

591
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,120
One

592
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't want to see any injustice

593
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,680
Someone who has made any mistakes

594
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,599
But all my grievances are from you

595
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,559
I understand

596
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,599
What do you understand

597
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,640
You don't understand anything

598
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,120
You don't have to do so much for me

599
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,319
You can't decide anything for me either

600
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,359
You make me feel like a fool now

601
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,800
I satirize you and dig at you every day

602
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,319
Wait a minute

603
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,199
What did Ben do for you

604
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,719
I can't tell you that

605
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,239
What's the matter with you today

606
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,479
Suddenly so sad

607
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,400
Did someone say something to you

608
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,120
Nobody said anything to me

609
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm just mad at myself

610
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,719
Be angry with yourself

611
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,040
All along

612
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,520
I seem to care about you very much

613
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,079
But I didn't actually do anything for you

614
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,079
In addition to danger and trouble

615
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,520
I don't seem to have done anything for you

616
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,640
What if you really want to give Ben Wang

617
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,120
You will give this king a good life

618
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,000
I know

619
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,719
To protect my life

620
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:35,839
You paid so much

621
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:37,839
Don't worry, I promise

622
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,040
Be sure to live well

623
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,040
Eat quickly

624
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,520
That's right

625
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,680
What did you go to the palace to find out

626
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,799
Actually

627
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,039
My mother is still alive

628
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,559
Probably in the palace

629
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,880
Did you find anything

630
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,400
Kind of

631
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,880
Is it possible that the news is wrong

632
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:12,559
After all, time has passed for so many years

633
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,400
If the princess is still alive,

634
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,599
She will definitely come to you

635
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,799
How can you wait so long

636
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,480
What if my mother was confined in the palace

637
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,880
So Ben Wang must find her

638
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:26,279
Find out the truth

639
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,640
Then if you are really in the palace,

640
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:35,960
What are you going to do

641
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,039
Take her home

642
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:44,200
If the anecdotal rumors are true

643
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,120
The emperor vs. Princess Xianjing

644
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:49,839
If it's true

645
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:52,680
The emperor may not allow you to take her away

646
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,279
If he doesn't allow it

647
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,120
This king will rob

648
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,559
Qi Zhang

649
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,079
A fish

650
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:04,319
If my mother were in the palace,

651
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,960
It is inevitable that I will have friction with the emperor

652
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,400
The reason why I tell you the truth today

653
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:10,999
I want you to be more careful in the future

654
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,200
Today

655
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,519
I can take care of you

656
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,279
But what about the future

657
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,359
What if our king is gone

658
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,359
Qi Zhang

659
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,319
What if your mother doesn't want you to do this at all

660
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,200
She doesn't want you to risk it at all

661
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,680
I don't want you to be an enemy of the emperor

662
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,319
Mother is worried about me

663
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,079
Nature doesn't want me to take risks

664
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,079
But as a son of man

665
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:35,359
Can you watch your mother in prison

666
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,359
And abandon her

667
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,680
Then you don't have to be so tense

668
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,799
If you are really worried about the princess,

669
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:41,960
You think for her

670
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,999
As a mother

671
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,799
How can I hope you act rashly like this

672
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:45,999
Don't worry

673
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,440
There must be another solution

674
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,319
I hope so

675
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,240
Micro-minister to do it

676
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,799
Sovereign

677
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,559
Although the emperor has not yet issued a decree to reform the office,

678
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,999
But as the hospital envoy of Taiyuan Hospital,

679
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,999
I have been recognized as not good at learning art

680
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,359
I'm afraid

681
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,920
It's not easy to get close to Xiao Rong Wang

682
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:15,920
This king will intercede with the emperor for you

683
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:19,440
But Gao Guifei no longer trusts me

684
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,120
Today, I also speak and lecture

685
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm afraid in the future

686
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,440
Won't let me continue to treat Xiao Rong Wang

687
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,240
The situation of the Gao family

688
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,519
It is now a spent force

689
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,200
The emperor promised

690
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,440
What can she say

691
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:44,920
Where is Lord He

692
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,999
This suggests that you are the one who poisons every day

693
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,279
You're the one who did the poisoning

694
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:57,519
The success or failure of this game

695
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,039
It's all up to you, Lord He

696
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,359
Rest assured

697
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,400
There is Ben Wang around

698
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,680
Never lose control

699
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:18,799
Micro-minister obeys

700
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Why did you show up in time today

701
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,680
Imperial concubine also has your eyeliner

702
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,319
After enjoying the flowers in Jingwangfu,

703
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,759
I arranged it

704
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,079
On that day, the imperial concubine stopped talking

705
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:37,960
Gao Mo once said

706
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,920
In addition to He Guang's family,

707
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,960
No one else

708
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,079
See the Imperial Concubine and Xiao Rong Wang

709
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,200
I think there is something strange about it

710
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,559
Unexpectedly

711
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,519
Saved you today instead

712
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,039
Today, when I went to detoxify Xiao Rong Wang,

713
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,079
Found another poison in his system

714
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,640
The concentration is not large

715
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
But the feeling of getting a little closer

716
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,839
No wonder Ning Wang let Xiaorong Wang ignore it for many years

717
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,319
It turned out to be poisoned in the dark

718
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,039
It's really mean

719
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,720
Do you know what kind of poison this is

720
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:12,920
I don't know yet, so there is no way to solve it

721
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,599
If only my master were here

722
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,160
Your master

723
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,200
Yeah

724
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,359
My master is very knowledgeable

725
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,200
If she were here,

726
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,319
I must know what poison it is

727
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:26,839
Nothing

728
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,200
I'll find a way

729
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,039
It's getting late. Go back to rest early

730
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,359
Go away

731
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,120
Go away

732
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,880
Don't even say goodbye

733
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,920
Little heartless

734
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,559
Lanya, don't be afraid

735
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,319
Do it with confidence

736
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,519
It won't happen with dad and prince

737
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,480
Dad

738
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:02,999
That's poisoning the prince

739
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,640
How can we get away with it

740
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,440
You put this osseophagus in the soup

741
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,079
Let Xiao Rong Wang take it

742
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:22,999
He won't be poisoned until seven days later

743
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,120
The symptoms are like a cold

744
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,839
No one will ever find out about us

745
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,799
That's not true, dad

746
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,279
Although the emperor cared little about Xiao Rong Wang,

747
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,519
But after all, it is the first blood

748
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:44,599
In case something happens

749
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm afraid even King Ning can't protect himself

750
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:48,599
Not to mention our congratulatory family

751
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,519
How

752
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,359
Don't you even listen to Dad now

753
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,359
My daughter is afraid

754
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,400
It's just this thing

755
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,960
It's not just about you, my father and daughter

756
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,720
It's more about the whole He family

757
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Daughter can't do it

758
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:03,200
I hope dad forgives me

759
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:05,160
Lan Ya

760
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,519
Get up

761
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:13,519
Now, do you really think

762
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,240
Did our family pick it clean

763
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:31,680
Xiao Rong Wang's body has recovered in recent years

764
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,160
I am in his soup every day

765
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,799
Under a poison called tendrils and vines

766
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,359
And then you will send it yourself

767
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:44,400
If it weren't for the sudden intervention of the Shen fish

768
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,319
Xiao Rong Wang is dead now

769
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:49,999
Dad

770
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:52,359
You used me to poison

771
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,240
How come you never told me

772
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,720
If you knew

773
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,640
Can still as if nothing had happened

774
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,880
Send poison into the mouth of Xiao Rong Wang

775
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,519
Lan Ya

776
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,759
Xiao Rong Wang can't stay any longer

777
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,519
It must be removed as soon as possible

778
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,440
Otherwise, we really have no way out
