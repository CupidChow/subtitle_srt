1
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,240
Mother, look at the lanterns I made

2
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,599
Our Ayi paintings are the best

3
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,439
Let's eat together

4
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:10,919
Come

5
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,480
Sit down to eat

6
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,839
Good

7
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:12,519
Yeah

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,079
Coming, coming

9
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,239
Good good

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,480
I want to eat steamed perch made by my mother

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,399
Good

12
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,879
To

13
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,680
Know that Ayi likes to eat fish

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,399
Your mother

15
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,520
But I've been busy in the kitchen all night

16
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,559
The emperor has a decree

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,319
Guilty minister Gu subsists

18
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,439
In the name of miscarriage safety

19
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,120
Poisoning the imperial heir in Gao Guifei's belly with medicine

20
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,359
His crime should be punished

21
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,800
Everyone in the family is on death row

22
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,480
Waiting for a drop

23
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,800
Yes

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,519
It's done, it's done

25
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,799
Great good things have come true

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
About the Zhou family

27
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,759
Who says no

28
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
Although it is Chongxi

29
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,879
But you also took advantage of it

30
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,959
That Zhou family

31
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,640
However, Suzhou House is famous for its high-ranking family

32
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,959
Just that week, little childe

33
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,399
That was born more beautiful than her daughter's house

34
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,239
Poetry, calligraphy, literature and ink

35
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,319
Everything is excellent

36
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:20,000
I heard that I have to go to Beijing after that

37
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,759
But the only regret

38
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,039
Is the disease

39
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,200
But then again

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,920
If Childe Zhou is well

41
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,000
You will be Mrs. Zhou in the future

42
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,360
There will be endless splendor and wealth in the future

43
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,319
Come on

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,599
Cut the crap next to it

45
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:37,599
Just say how much they pay

46
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,080
Before getting married

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,519
Give a hundred and twenty dollars first

48
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,159
Give another five hundred taels when it's done

49
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,879
Go and reply quickly

50
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,879
Just say I'll take the job

51
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,120
Don't let others take the lead

52
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Ruined my business

53
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,759
What kind of business

54
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,720
This is a lifetime event

55
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,280
How long is a lifetime

56
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,679
I've always been happy with the present

57
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,920
But at least you have to clean up

58
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,959
Otherwise, it's just like you

59
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:01,399
Mrs. Zhou thought I was

60
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,920
Brought a beggar to the door

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
It's strange to promise

62
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,319
This is quite good

63
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,440
Line line line

64
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,720
Tidy up

65
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,759
Dress up

66
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:10,920
Good

67
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,239
How did you get round to Suzhou

68
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,879
Chased you all the way

69
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,000
Why are you chasing me

70
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,759
It's not my dad yet

71
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,080
You are the only disciple

72
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,599
You insist on going to Beijing

73
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,080
He is worried about whether you will go or not

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,720
I have to follow

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,599
These years

76
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,959
Yongzhou is not peaceful

77
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
It's better to take the initiative than to wait and die

78
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
You go to Beijing

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,320
Is it really because the emperor used to

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,639
Choosing the crown prince in the imperial clan

81
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,720
That imperial edict

82
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,760
This king is a pulse of Taizu

83
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,199
All the emperors of the past dynasties were Taizong

84
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,000
In addition to the military power in hand,

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,560
Besides the title of King Jing,

86
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,679
At best, I am a distant cousin

87
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,880
Therefore, the emperor will never choose me as the crown prince

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,040
In that case, just call it sick and don't go

89
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,799
Why do you have to struggle to store this muddy water

90
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,399
This king got the news

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,799
Years ago

92
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,040
The servant girl who went to Beijing with my mother is still alive

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,840
She said it herself

94
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,079
My mother is still alive

95
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,239
Where is the princess now

96
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:40,880
Don't know

97
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,239
She just said

98
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,679
Before the ship sank

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,919
My mother was taken away in secret

100
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,880
And then he killed the whole ship

101
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,840
Fortunately, the girl knew water and escaped

102
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,479
After my mother's accident

103
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,359
I followed my father to Beijing for a secret investigation

104
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,399
Father

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,120
That's where you get killed

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Then there is the case of Xiaorong Wang, which is well known all over the country

107
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,320
Do you suspect that these things are related to the Xiao Rong Wang case

108
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,679
So even if it's a sea of fire,

109
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,479
This king has to go to Beijing, too

110
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Just why did you come to Jiangnan again

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,560
When my mother

112
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
I came to Beijing after receiving a letter from the Zhou family

113
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,399
I've been secretly searching for years

114
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,679
It's a pity

115
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
This week, the family was controlled by the old lady

116
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,120
It's really amazing

117
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:33,919
Only the three rooms of the concubine

118
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,040
Estranged from the old lady

119
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
This king got the news

120
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,679
After Zhou Yue's wedding tomorrow,

121
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:39,959
Will go to Beijing to donate officials

122
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,840
Donation official

123
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,840
The children of this aristocratic family usually donate officials to the outside world

124
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,919
It seems that Zhou Yue

125
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,679
Is to get rid of Mrs. Zhou's old fox

126
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,320
I mean your grandmother's control

127
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,760
That's right. It's an old fox

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,440
Then Zhou Yue can't stay in Beijing

129
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,239
It's useless, too

130
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,959
It's not up to him to stay in Beijing or not

131
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,160
Even so, Zhou Yue acted strangely

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,639
And never associate with people

133
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,639
I'm afraid it won't be used by us

134
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,359
I never said I was looking for him

135
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,560
Bring a gift tomorrow

136
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,799
Let's go and meet this cousin Dengke for a while

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,440
Let's go

138
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,560
You said I asked you to dress up

139
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,399
Why are you dressed so shabby

140
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,679
Doesn't this look good

141
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,239
I have to tell you something.

142
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,199
You'll see Mrs. Zhou later

143
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
As long as you don't talk nonsense

144
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,280
It's a sure thing to do

145
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,959
Let me tell you something

146
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,880
Everything is available up and down the mansion

147
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,320
You can get married tomorrow

148
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,560
You can rest assured

149
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,959
Let me count on my fingers

150
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,000
Me and this week's little boy

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,239
There is a fate of five hundred and twenty

152
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,519
Even if he dies tonight

153
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,880
I also absolutely send Buddha to the West

154
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
I gave him a wake

155
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,959
In short, you must never see financial water

156
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,959
My little aunt

157
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,040
Wait a minute

158
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,919
Don't let the cat out of the bag

159
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,639
Understand

160
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,120
Talk less and don't stick to people

161
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:30,919
This little brother

162
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,679
Would you please report back to madam

163
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,880
Just say matchmaker Hao asked for an audience

164
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,600
Just a moment, please

165
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,679
Have you never seen such a spacious house

166
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,320
See you later, madam. Be good

167
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
It will be your home after this

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,720
Just a moment, please

169
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,440
Yes

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,959
I told you you were dressed shabby

171
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,840
What's wrong with this? I think it's fine

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,160
You guys, come in with me

173
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,079
Don't be rude

174
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,280
To behave well

175
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,640
Please

176
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,080
Madam

177
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,239
This is Shen Yu

178
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,560
Call someone

179
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,239
East

180
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,719
Hello, madam

181
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,880
Ma'am, don't blame

182
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,359
This girl has never seen the world since she was a child

183
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
See madam, your temperament is elegant

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,760
She is inevitably nervous

185
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,320
The lady has drooping eyebrows

186
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,520
Ears thin and soft

187
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,400
Grace can't be seen

188
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,960
It's a bit weak

189
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,080
But it's all right

190
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,120
Such a mother-in-law is easy to handle

191
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,599
The face is white

192
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,400
How old are you

193
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,799
Who else is there at home

194
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,560
It's seventeen

195
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,279
I can't remember much when I was a child

196
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't know if my parents are here or not

197
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,279
Madam Hui

198
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,279
This girl was abducted by kidnappers if she can't remember

199
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,120
Later, it was picked up by a good-hearted person and raised

200
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,960
Is a poor man

201
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,320
Who was raised by

202
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:37,760
He is a barefoot doctor who travels across the country

203
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,080
But I got a cold at the beginning of the year

204
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
Die of illness

205
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,760
She's left alone

206
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,560
If Madame leaves her

207
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,359
It was Jidade who gave her a way to live

208
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,960
Childe will also be safe

209
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,120
Is Shen Yu your real name

210
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,159
Yes

211
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,919
My wish is

212
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,479
Rich every day, more than every year

213
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,520
The Zhou family is a noble family

214
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,960
High door and large family

215
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,359
If you enter the door,

216
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,640
Is the bride

217
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,520
Obey the rules that should be observed

218
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,760
Insurmountable

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,479
Unexpected

220
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,960
If you keep your duty

221
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,919
We

222
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,520
I will never mistreat you

223
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,719
Yes, madam

224
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,880
Only five hundred taels of silver was given

225
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,400
You won't bother about the future

226
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,359
You can also look at people by yourself

227
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,760
I won't die for about a while

228
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,120
Look at her rustic country appearance

229
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
How is it worthy of our young master

230
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,159
If it weren't for joy,

231
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,320
Come on, don't say a few words

232
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,560
Be careful she hears

233
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,679
When I entered the capital,

234
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,760
Is your young master alive or dead

235
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,640
This girl really doesn't care

236
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Congratulations

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,599
Thank you very much

238
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,159
Congratulations

239
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,599
Congratulations

240
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,560
Congratulations

241
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:43,320
Congratulations. Congratulations

242
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,880
Please

243
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,080
At least I'm here to choose a spy

244
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
Let's go in so blatantly

245
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,640
Not afraid of being discovered

246
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,320
The Zhou family hasn't seen me several times

247
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,039
The number of times these three rooms have seen me

248
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,279
It is very few

249
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,200
No one knows me except Zhou Yue

250
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,560
Zhou Yue is not enough

251
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,000
Being seriously ill

252
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,000
How can you pay homage to the church in person

253
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,640
Let's go

254
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,120
Congratulations. Congratulations

255
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,799
Girl, the fifth young master will feel unwell this time

256
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,719
I'm afraid I can't come out to worship

257
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,000
He's dead

258
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,520
No, no, no

259
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,560
You hold it in your arms for a while

260
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,039
Replace first

261
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,239
Just worship first

262
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,039
As long as he's not dead

263
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,359
This is the man you want to infiltrate the Chow family

264
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,000
I look at her eyes

265
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,760
I'm going to get into the golden lock

266
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,560
Be greedy for money and restrained

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,919
Is a wise man

268
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,719
Then let's go quickly

269
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,120
Good good

270
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,599
Let's go

271
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,400
That is to be greedy for money and not restrained

272
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,960
It's easy to handle

273
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,239
Let's go

274
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,839
Where's the groom

275
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,960
Why does the bride hold a chicken

276
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,440
Don't even come out to worship

277
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,839
I'm afraid the fifth young master can't do it

278
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,640
That Chongxi is not in vain

279
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,799
Come on

280
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,120
Bye quickly

281
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:50,960
Yes, madam

282
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,320
Worship heaven and earth

283
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,279
Second worship high hall

284
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,560
Husband

285
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,839
How to worship this

286
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,560
My husband

287
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:20,799
Xianggong

288
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,239
Don't go

289
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:22,679
Xianggong

290
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,239
Xianggong

291
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,279
Excuse me

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,760
Over there over there

293
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,440
Xianggong

294
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:38,919
Xianggong

295
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,799
Don't run away yet, Xianggong

296
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,120
Xianggong

297
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,799
How blessed the owner is

298
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,239
You don't have to pay homage to a white lady

299
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,359
But you are too unsympathetic

300
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,359
What should I do if such a wonderful person falls and hurts himself

301
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,560
What does it have to do with you

302
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,560
Come on

303
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,760
Come on

304
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,960
Come on, worship

305
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,839
Husband and wife worship each other

306
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,080
Li Cheng

307
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,400
Now it's time to take it back to the new house

308
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,919
Or take it to the kitchen and stew it

309
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,919
How much money does this noodle cost

310
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,760
I don't know if I can take it away

311
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,400
Five grandma don't have to worry

312
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,080
The fifth young master will surely get through this level

313
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,120
Love each other in the future

314
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,640
Husband and wife and beauty

315
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,560
Love each other and return husband and wife to beauty

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,719
Of course

317
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,200
Our young master is not a chronic disease

318
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,520
I only caught the cold when I was studying abroad

319
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,719
It will definitely be fine

320
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,760
Fifth grandmother can marry

321
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,320
Our young master is such a good person

322
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
You should really worship Buddha and be grateful every day

323
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,079
What is your name

324
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,079
Run inkstone

325
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,160
What

326
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,599
Handmaiden Run Inkstone

327
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:55,920
Runyan

328
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:02,040
Wild geese can be steamed, boiled and steamed in soy sauce

329
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,239
I've heard of La Yan, too

330
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,120
Why haven't I heard of Runyan?

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,000
I think you go well with your dress, too

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,079
Your name is Taohong, right

333
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,280
Peach

334
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,839
My name is given to me by the young master

335
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,800
What's the matter? Can't I change it

336
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,079
Can change can change

337
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,280
The housewife changed it

338
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,439
Good name

339
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,599
Let you scold me behind my back

340
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,520
How

341
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,239
I don't think this name is earthy

342
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:32,520
Me

343
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,479
Born in the market

344
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,000
Be very rustic

345
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,880
To be my maid

346
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,760
Things are like masters

347
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Peach

348
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,520
Peach

349
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,559
I am happy when I hear this name

350
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,199
I'm so happy that I want to listen to music

351
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,280
Can you sing

352
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,959
You

353
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,319
Pass on your wife's words

354
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
The fifth young master is unwell

355
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,680
Please also ask Grandma Wu to move to Jingyuan

356
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,479
Meet the previous side

357
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm sick again

358
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,800
Then let's go quickly

359
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,719
Don't be too late for a while

360
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,120
Let's go

361
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,880
This little Xianggong looks like a man and a woman

362
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,280
It's more beautiful than me

363
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,120
Young master is weak and needs to have a good life and rest

364
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,680
These days, you live in the cross-garden first

365
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,199
When he is well,

366
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,839
Then move to Jingyuan to live together

367
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,319
I can do it all

368
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,520
Why don't you go back to your room and have a rest

369
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,199
Run inkstone

370
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,439
Five young masters

371
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,400
You should serve Grandma Five well in the future

372
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,880
Hui Wu Young Master

373
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:03,640
Grandma has changed the name of handmaiden to Taohong

374
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:08,959
Peach

375
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,839
Peach and willow green

376
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:14,439
Spring is full of vitality

377
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,640
A Yue

378
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,359
What's wrong with you

379
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,319
What's wrong with you

380
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,520
Don't scare your mother

381
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,280
Although Xiao Xianggong is pale,

382
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,959
But the eyes are bright and vivid

383
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,559
It doesn't seem to be terminally ill

384
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,239
Let me give him a pulse

385
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:32,319
Even if this five hundred taels complimentary

386
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,680
Madam

387
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,160
Actually, I know some medical skills

388
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,040
Why don't I take his pulse

389
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:38,920
No need

390
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,040
Why don't you move to the cross-garden to have a rest first

391
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,479
Don't disturb young master's illness here

392
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,359
Pulse is also disturbing

393
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,040
You really don't need me

394
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,800
Why don't you go back to rest for the time being

395
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,239
Don't forget it

396
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,239
I still don't understand

397
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,400
Why are you looking for a happy bride

398
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,160
To be an eyeliner

399
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,559
Don't

400
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,120
Because she called you Xianggong that day

401
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,120
Let your ten thousand-year-old cycas sprout

402
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,680
So it's jobbery

403
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,199
Favoritism for one's affection

404
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,000
This is not called idiot

405
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:44,000
It's stupid

406
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,800
Do you think Ben Wang would be such a fool

407
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,520
Waiting for the day when you hit your face

408
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,559
You speak louder

409
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,839
No, it's not

410
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,719
I really think

411
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:56,359
I don't think she is reliable in any way

412
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,959
She should be

413
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,559
I have long been eyeing the Zhou family

414
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,760
This can be grasped

415
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,280
Chong Xi's opportunity to blend in

416
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,000
She's not simple

417
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,160
Then she sneaked into Zhou's house

418
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,839
What exactly is the purpose

419
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Whatever the purpose

420
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,199
Use her first

421
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,199
Explore the situation of the Zhou family and talk about it again

422
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:18,359
To say that her luck is also excellent

423
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
The Zhou family is saying now

424
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,400
Now Zhou Yue is well

425
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,559
It is because of the blessings brought by her happiness

426
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,880
The news was just in time

427
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
Why are you going so late

428
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,520
Go and see if Zhou Yue's disease is really good this week

429
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,880
And guard me like a thief

430
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,920
I'll see what's wrong with it

431
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,359
Don't harbour evil intentions

432
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,880
Turn back and bring trouble to me

433
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,359
Shen Yu, this girl

434
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,800
I really don't know any rules

435
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,520
It's just greedy for money

436
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,000
It's also slippery and difficult to control

437
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,800
I wish I had found someone timid and obedient

438
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,280
Have a slippery temper

439
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,439
So as to deal with the screwdriver in Beijing

440
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,479
Be greedy for money

441
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,599
As long as you give enough money, it will be good

442
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,359
If you are timid and obedient

443
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,239
Who did you listen to in the end

444
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,479
This little Xianggong can see clearly

445
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,839
As long as you give enough money,

446
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,959
There is really nothing we can't talk about

447
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
It doesn't hurt to give more money

448
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,719
You said the people out there right now

449
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,520
Everyone knows that you are well

450
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,719
I can't go on pretending to be sick

451
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,239
Then if she suddenly gets married,

452
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,680
But what can I do

453
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,000
It turned out to be pretending to be sick

454
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,280
No wonder you don't let me near

455
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,239
It seems that the rumor is true

456
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,079
They have three rooms and a big room in the Zhou family

457
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,760
It's really a fierce competition

458
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,400
Who are you

459
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,400
Why do you look so familiar

460
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,479
Thief

461
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,479
Let me tell you something

462
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,719
The warehouse goes down here

463
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,479
Go down and go straight

464
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,439
Turn left

465
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,239
You go quickly

466
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,120
What are you looking at

467
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,280
I think my husband

468
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,719
Look at your own husband

469
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,359
Need to climb up to the roof and peep

470
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,079
The words are really ugly

471
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,800
What do you mean, peeping? I call it

472
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,959
Do I need to explain my name to you

473
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,800
You gotta go, you gotta go

474
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,040
What if I refuse

475
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:31,800
No

476
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,319
I said, how can you be a man

477
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
Someone eavesdropped on the roof

478
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,000
You

479
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,000
Shen fish

480
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:54,839
You

481
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,920
You eavesdropped on us

482
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,839
Why on earth are you lying on the roof

483
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,520
Shit

484
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,319
If they knew

485
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,920
I heard Zhou Yue pretending to be ill

486
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm afraid

487
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm going to be expelled from Zhou's house

488
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,400
I want to leave

489
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,680
I can't pass

490
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,079
Harmonization

491
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,160
Why do you suddenly want to leave

492
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,599
Why

493
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,239
I suffered a loss in this marriage

494
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,479
Your hearts are like mirrors

495
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,719
Don't play dumb with me

496
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,079
Write and leave the book quickly so that I can leave

497
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:22,479
This

498
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,280
What is the reason

499
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,920
You are the daughter-in-law that my Zhou Jiaming matchmaker is marrying

500
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,079
You can't say it's scattered

501
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,079
You have to ask, don't you

502
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,120
Then I'll say it.

503
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,120
What you said in the house

504
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,599
I heard it all

505
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,400
You

506
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,079
Be sick

507
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,000
You can't do that

508
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:45,719
Then why are you marrying me

509
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,079
Back Widow

510
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,359
That's what you heard.

511
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,319
There are other things

512
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:52,760
No

513
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,520
Absolutely not

514
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,640
I didn't expect it

515
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,079
Such a big thing

516
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,640
I know

517
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,520
Shen Yu

518
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,479
Anyway

519
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,000
Close the door. We are also a family

520
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,199
What do you want to say

521
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,800
Go back to your room and say it's okay

522
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,559
Also

523
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,319
The sparse courtyard under the big moon

524
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,359
It's really inappropriate to say this

525
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,160
Go back to your room and say it

526
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,839
On-the-spot response is ok

527
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,400
I am a real person

528
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,239
I'll leave as soon as you give me the money

529
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,239
I won't say a word

530
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,319
Things that can be solved with silver

531
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,160
Don't make it too complicated, everyone

532
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,319
What if I want to keep you?

533
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,439
What did you leave me for

534
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,479
You can't

535
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,199
I understand

536
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,680
Hurting people's face is equivalent to harming people's lives

537
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:16,199
What about me

538
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,680
Is a kind person

539
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,599
I won't say anything

540
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,160
Is

541
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,079
Why did you leave me here

542
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,680
I always have a wife

543
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,680
The truth is this

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,079
But I took the five hundred taels

545
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,479
That's Chongxi money

546
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,640
Nobody told me

547
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,680
This little Xianggong survived

548
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,079
I have to keep it for a living

549
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:35,640
Right

550
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
How can you speak out

551
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,160
A thousand taels

552
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,920
One thousand taels a year

553
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,000
Half up front

554
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,079
No credit

555
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:43,800
No problem

556
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,160
So happy

557
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,520
It's going to be less

558
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,040
But I have two conditions

559
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,880
First

560
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,599
If you leave halfway in less than a year,

561
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,359
Whether you take the initiative or are forced to do so

562
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,479
Double return of silver

563
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,920
Your Zhou family is not a long pool of tigers

564
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Why should I leave

565
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,680
Second

566
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,719
You will follow me to Beijing

567
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,319
You have to go to Beijing

568
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:18,479
That's not to stay away from your native land

569
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,880
Separate from one's hometown

570
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,199
Is it miserable and miserable

571
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
I've grown so big

572
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,800
Never left Suzhou House

573
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,880
Suddenly let me go so far away

574
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,760
I suddenly have a little bit

575
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,040
Is it difficult

576
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,439
You have to add money

577
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,800
Double

578
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,160
That's two thousand taels a year

579
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,599
Xiao Xianggong

580
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,120
Have something to say

581
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,599
You spend so much money

582
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,040
I suddenly couldn't bear it

583
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,079
What kind of disease do you have?

584
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,479
Actually, your daughter-in-law and I also know some medical skills

585
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,199
In this aspect of treating men,

586
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,400
Still have a lot of experience

587
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,319
Why don't I give you a handful

588
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,839
All right

589
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,319
Then you two go to bed early

590
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,000
That girl looks a little vulgar

591
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,520
But it seems that there is nothing bad in mind

592
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,120
If enough silver is given,

593
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,640
It should not ruin our plan

594
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,880
People's hearts are unpredictable

595
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,959
We'd better be cautious

596
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,520
If it weren't for Hou Fu's tight

597
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:35,040
You don't have to pretend to be sick and get married

598
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,599
Now

599
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,120
This is the best we can do

600
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,359
The news will come out at dawn tomorrow

601
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,160
Say I'm cured

602
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,079
It is easy to give birth to changes if it is delayed for a long time

603
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,199
We can also set off for Beijing

604
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,439
As long as that girl is famous

605
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,680
Old lady

606
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,520
You can't arrange another girl for me

607
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,439
I must have arrived in Beijing

608
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,959
The old lady won't let it go

609
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,880
She's been planning to be there for you

610
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,040
Arrange a woman

611
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,359
Inside and outside

612
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,719
Our three rooms will be in their hands

613
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,280
Zhou Jia Da Fang Er Fang

614
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,280
Seems to be a direct offspring

615
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,559
Actually

616
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,000
It's just gold and jade

617
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,439
They have been in deficit for many years

618
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,280
The family business has long been running out

619
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,000
That's why I've been thinking about controlling us

620
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,640
This visit to Beijing

621
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,800
There is no need to deal with it

622
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,640
I don't know if that Shen fish can endure it

623
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,920
After all, the screwdriver in Beijing

624
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,479
It's not easy to get along with

625
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm worried about this, too

626
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
My situation

627
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:43,359
I can't let them put people around me

628
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,599
It's all my mother's fault

629
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:47,680
At that time

630
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,680
Your father married me

631
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,359
I couldn't give birth after seven years

632
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,839
Beyond the capital

633
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,160
I want to adopt the youngest son of the Duke to your father

634
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,760
It is clear that we should control our three rooms

635
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,280
Later

636
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
I gave birth to you

637
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,160
Your father sent a letter to Hou Fu

638
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,880
Lie about having a son

639
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,400
Who expected it

640
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,239
I can't give you another brother

641
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,359
It's made it so difficult for you now

642
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,599
Mom, don't say this again

643
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
Be careful to be heard

644
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,839
I am the fifth young master of Zhou family

645
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,319
You can't say this wrong when you talk in your sleep

646
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,880
Mother understands

647
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,040
If the old lady knows that you are a woman,

648
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,120
Where is our mother's way to live

649
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,400
There is always a way to live

650
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,199
I have entrusted Lord Meng

651
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,400
Begging him to plan to donate officials for me

652
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,719
Donation official

653
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,120
I can't participate in the imperial examination

654
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,120
You can only donate an official to find an official body

655
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,400
As long as it is released as an official

656
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,199
You can take it for granted

657
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:55,920
Leave the control of Houfu in Beijing

658
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,239
Xianggong

659
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,800
The young master said that you should take the carriage in the back

660
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,680
Well, serve my husband well

661
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,719
It's okay. Don't help me

662
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,719
What's the hurry to put down

663
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,880
Nothing

664
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,439
Our five housewives

665
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,959
It's so easy to serve

666
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,359
It's time to arrive at the post station

667
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,199
Mother

668
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,280
You slow down

669
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,079
This man is so impatient

670
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,359
It seems that it has to be arranged as soon as possible

671
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,239
Guest officer, please

672
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,400
Auntie, please

673
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,040
A fish

674
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,520
What are you looking at

675
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,959
I see you, Xianggong

676
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,239
Xianggong, I'm looking at you

677
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:46,880
Look from a distance

678
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,079
Your posture is simply unparalleled

679
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,599
What Pan an and Song Yu

680
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,880
Dump them a few blocks

681
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,959
Those soaring immortals in Wei and Jin Dynasties

682
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,520
No matter how immortal you are, you have gone

683
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,640
Xianggong

684
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,880
Have no words to find words

685
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,760
Xianggong

686
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,280
Quickly

687
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,120
Quick, quick, quick

688
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,520
Where's the money

689
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:42,760
Do you have enough

690
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,240
Come on

691
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,799
Don't look like you two are going to die

692
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:04,559
Can you look at me

693
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,680
What I do is to buy and sell in good faith

694
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,799
Very honest

695
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,480
As long as you give enough money

696
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,400
I promise I'll let you wild mandarin ducks

697
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,480
Double-night and double-flight

698
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,920
And it's justified

699
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:17,039
You have done a good job in this business

700
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,839
So what can you do about it

701
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,799
When I came here just now,

702
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,720
See that river outside

703
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,319
Aunt

704
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,799
You go to the river later

705
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:32,839
Pounce on it and jump inside

706
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,839
Then you bitch also went to the river

707
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:35,599
His name is

708
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,120
Liu Que

709
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,559
Hangxing Liu Que

710
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,359
Liu Que also went to the river

711
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,359
Jump in with a jerk

712
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,359
And then what about me

713
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,240
Just pretend to be a passerby

714
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,319
I fanned the flames nearby

715
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:47,720
The noise will be loud

716
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,799
And then I said

717
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:50,319
I said you, you were killed by you

718
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:52,079
Liu Que

719
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,359
Be rescued

720
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,279
This touch also touched and hugged

721
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,400
What should I do? What festivals should I keep

722
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,759
You can only marry him, right

723
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,279
How about that? Isn't that a good plan

724
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,720
This

725
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,999
It's too embarrassing for my sister-in-law

726
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,640
Anyway, you two discuss it yourself

727
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:07,519
After tonight

728
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,599
I don't have any other way

729
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,519
But if you don't try

730
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,799
When you enter the capital, you will never have a chance again

731
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,519
But how hard it is for her to do

732
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,120
What about sister-in-law

733
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,599
But

734
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,039
Or we'll try it

735
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,759
I can't swim either

736
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
I said how long do you have to discuss it

737
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,279
I said you'll have to slow down a little longer

738
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:31,200
I think this day has to be

739
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,359
Or we'll do what she wants

740
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:37,999
Why are you again

741
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:38,799
Row

742
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,960
Why do you keep following me

743
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,960
Publicly abetting a good woman to elope with others

744
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,400
And make a profit from it

745
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,880
You have a lot of courage

746
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,720
You two don't have to be afraid

747
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,839
It doesn't matter. Let's buy and sell

748
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,640
You come down

749
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,599
I'm coming down

750
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,519
No

751
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,759
I have no grievances with you

752
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:07,880
You always ruin my business

753
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,279
Isn't it appropriate to bully me as a weak woman

754
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,799
You are a weak woman

755
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,759
Of course

756
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,160
I'm so weak

757
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,440
Can't be weaker

758
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:19,480
Hidden weapon

759
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:21,039
Despicable means

760
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,599
What means do you care about hurting people

761
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,880
Only a hypocrite like you cares about form

762
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,079
Big Brother Big Brother

763
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,120
Where are you going

764
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,599
Big Brother

765
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,359
Don't hurt me don't hurt me

766
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,880
How about this

767
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:36,720
The money

768
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,359
You two

769
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:37,920
You this

770
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,200
You're half with me

771
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,920
No more

772
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,160
You think I'll go with you

773
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,920
Just to take your dirty money

774
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,920
I set up talented people and beautiful women

775
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,120
Why am I dirty

776
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,799
How do you know they are gifted scholars and beautiful women

777
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,640
Why can't it be the man

778
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,640
Figure the woman is rich

779
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,759
Bao matchmaking and Bao gave birth to a son

780
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,480
People are her own eyes

781
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,039
What does it matter to me if I really pretend

782
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,240
I just make money conveniently

783
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,599
Make money

784
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,240
You are still short of money when you marry Zhou Yue

785
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,400
What do you know

786
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,519
Of course, money is earned by yourself, and it is comfortable to spend it

787
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:18,039
Let go

788
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,440
What do you do

789
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,400
Someone

790
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,319
Nausea

791
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,240
These people are all here to find you

792
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,799
That's for robbing money

793
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Master said

794
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,599
How can people want to live

795
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,519
The most important thing is to see the opportunity and know the times

796
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,480
It is obviously a dark and windy night

797
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,680
Easy to see blood

798
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:39,200
Still have to hide

799
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,799
If all the masters of the family die this week,

800
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,759
Then I'm just gone, aren't I

801
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,999
The possessions are still in it

802
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,599
How to mix after this

803
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Risk your life like this and go back

804
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,799
Just for those crap money

805
00:40:58,279 --> 00:40:59,960
Yes, money is my life

806
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,519
Do you care? You

807
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:08,759
I'd like to see what you can do

808
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:40,039
Don't sleep. There's an assassin

809
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,720
Run quickly

810
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,039
Fool

811
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,160
Although greedy for money, it is still brave

812
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,519
Get up and run. There's an assassin

813
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:52,359
Do me a favor, big brother. Do me a favor

814
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:52,880
What for

815
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,359
Quick, quick, quick

816
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:55,079
What is it

817
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:55,519
Quickly

818
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,640
Quick, quick, quick

819
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,359
What trouble

820
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,279
On fire

821
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,240
Is anyone here

822
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,079
Help

823
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:46,880
Everybody run and hide quickly

824
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,599
There are assassins

825
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,640
These people are going to braise me in soy sauce

826
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,200
Somebody, please

827
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,519
Help

828
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:10,400
Is anyone here

829
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:12,519
Somebody, please

830
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:13,999
Help

831
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:16,039
Is anyone here

832
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:17,519
Zhou Yue, is that you

833
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,039
Fish is me

834
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,079
You come out

835
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,920
I can't walk with a sprained ankle

836
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:23,640
How many bad things do you have to do here

837
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,759
You are so unlucky

838
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,720
Zhou Yue
