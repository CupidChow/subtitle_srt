1
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,480
A bunch of nonsense

2
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,319
Why are you so excited

3
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,239
I haven't finished yet

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
I thought you said you sealed his acupuncture points

5
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,279
I forgot to seal the acupuncture points and lost my martial arts

6
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:05,240
It doesn't affect his running

7
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,439
Quickly

8
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Stop

9
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,239
You can run very well

10
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,520
Don't you come over here

11
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,120
You stand there for me

12
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I told you to come back

13
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,559
I'm going to jump now

14
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,759
There are many rocks under here

15
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,959
If you jump, you won't even have a whole body.

16
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,200
Right

17
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,079
Anyway, I will die after all

18
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,079
I can pull

19
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,319
Take care of all the lives of my family and bury them with me

20
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:55,999
It's worth it

21
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,560
What you said makes sense

22
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,679
Then you jump

23
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:00,639
Can't jump

24
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:01,600
Right

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,439
Can't jump

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,079
Can't jump

27
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,959
Yeah, can't jump, can't jump

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,079
If he dies,

29
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:07,439
What can Gu Jia take to reverse his verdict

30
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:07,920
Right

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,639
Shen fish

32
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,319
You let him jump

33
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,399
You calm down

34
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,160
Everything is negotiable

35
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,719
Never be impulsive

36
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,039
It will do

37
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,319
It's okay not to jump

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,280
Right

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
You two let me live

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,600
After I go back and settle down,

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,679
I will make public the crimes committed by He Guang

42
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,079
How is it

43
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,560
No, you think I'm stupid

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,359
Then I'll jump now. Who can't think of it

45
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:36,679
Stop

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,639
Shen fish

47
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,079
You let him jump

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,560
Ben Wang Pingsheng hates being threatened most

49
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,639
Isn't it just one person's certificate

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,039
Find another one after you die

51
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,560
Your Highness

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,200
How long did I wait for this clue

53
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:50,999
Yes

54
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,080
You let him jump now

55
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,840
Where do you want me to find another one

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,759
What can Gu Jia take to reverse his verdict

57
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,120
Then don't turn it over

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,599
That case has been going on for so long

59
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:00,840
Take care of those things at home

60
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,399
Maybe it has already been forgotten

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,720
Qi Zhang

62
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:05,440
How

63
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,239
I just thought

64
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,599
You are cool thin by nature

65
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,599
Right

66
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,640
I didn't realize it was inhuman

67
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
It wasn't your family who killed the door

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You don't matter, do you

69
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:15,679
Presumptuous

70
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,319
I enlighten the royal family

71
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,120
Don't let you talk nonsense here

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,879
I think you think your life is too long

73
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,200
What do you mean

74
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,200
You're gonna force me to death, aren't you

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
If you want to die, die

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,840
Anyway, the king doesn't want to take care of your affairs anymore

77
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:29,560
Good

78
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll die for you now

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm gonna jump right now

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,239
I went to see the ancestors of the family

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,039
Dispelling gas

82
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:36,519
You jump

83
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,319
I'll make amends to them

84
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,159
You jump quickly

85
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,080
You didn't persuade her

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,159
After a while, he died

87
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,440
Got it

88
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,280
You two just

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,159
Did you lie to me by acting on purpose

90
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,159
It's called tacit understanding

91
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,560
Then don't waste your time. Let's go

92
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,799
It's too bullying

93
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,200
You are too bullying

94
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,399
Baggage

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,720
Hurry up

96
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,239
Suspect Ji Lu

97
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,920
This man gathered together to gather tiles

98
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,080
Murder and arson

99
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,200
Raiding a house

100
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,120
To commit all evils

101
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,159
The evidence is conclusive today

102
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,560
There is a reward of two thousand

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wanted by the whole city

104
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,840
It seems that someone wants to borrow the hands of the punishments department

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,679
Constrained to me

106
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,679
You have to make a sound

107
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,399
I let you go to a bad end now

108
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,159
Do you believe it

109
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
You've gone too far

110
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,360
Look at that

111
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,479
Now that the punishments department is involved,

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,440
Just explain it

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
It's out of your control

114
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,840
Right

115
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,600
Let me go early if you know me

116
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,040
It's good for everyone

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,720
Right

118
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,040
I think you forgot what it's like to be stabbed with a needle

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,600
Remember

120
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,239
What he said is not without reason

121
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,799
If the government finds him in my hands,

122
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm afraid it's hard to compete clearly

123
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:19,919
You see

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,320
Right

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Ming can't come

126
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,959
Then keep a low profile

127
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,399
Official Master

128
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Let's go

129
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,160
I warned you in advance

130
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,600
Don't play games with me later

131
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,399
Dealer

132
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,799
Bring me your bag

133
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,440
Let's go

134
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,639
Ok, thank you, sir

135
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,239
Next

136
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,440
Stop

137
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:44,919
Cover so tightly

138
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,040
How do I check

139
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:46,959
Show your face

140
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,239
The eldest brother of the officers and men is like this

141
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
When my dad was fleeing the wilderness,

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,600
Accidentally caught a strange disease

143
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,959
Please bend in and let us pass

144
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,959
It is impossible

145
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,440
Unless you take off your mask

146
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,679
Otherwise, you can't go to town

147
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,040
It's not my dad. After he got this disease,

148
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,959
A horrible face

149
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,320
And it can also infect people

150
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,199
I'm afraid of you and all the officers and men

151
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,199
Be implicated, really

152
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
I see more patients here every day

153
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,519
There's nothing to be scared of

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,440
Cut the crap

155
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,359
Take off the mask

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:13,919
Quickly

157
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,399
You see

158
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,399
Let's go

159
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:05,720
Cover your mouth tightly

160
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,079
Yes, thank you

161
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,399
Thank you officers and men, eldest brother

162
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,079
Stop

163
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,359
Although the old man can't see his facial features clearly,

164
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,959
But are there any marks on the neck

165
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,720
You can always see clearly

166
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,639
Take it off

167
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:21,799
Big Brother

168
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,840
You listen to me

169
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,840
My father has this disease except himself

170
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,160
It really infects people

171
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,320
Look at my mother

172
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,799
My cousin

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,840
And Aunt Wang next door is infected

174
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,799
I'm really worried about you guys

175
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:32,600
Just let us go

176
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,239
Cut the crap

177
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:34,600
Take it off

178
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:37,519
Hurry up

179
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,160
Stop

180
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,720
Don't run

181
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,679
Stop

182
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,639
You guys come with me

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,320
Yes

184
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,679
Yes

185
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:05,720
You run

186
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,919
When did I run away

187
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,600
You run

188
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,639
I didn't run

189
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,359
Didn't run

190
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,639
You just made eyes at people

191
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,679
You don't think I can tell

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,959
Don't I cooperate with you

193
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,959
You still cooperate with me

194
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,160
Are you cooperating with me

195
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:15,840
I just cooperate with you

196
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,160
Sit down

197
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:17,639
Sit down

198
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,479
Good

199
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,600
You are too bullying

200
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,040
Shut up

201
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,120
I got lost and escaped

202
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,600
My heart jumped to my throat just now

203
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,560
What if this is really caught?

204
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,280
General Han

205
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,479
Why are you here

206
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,079
You were the one who led the officers and men away just now

207
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,040
You came just in time

208
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
Just now, because of him, because of him

209
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:48,479
I'm just an errand boy

210
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,600
What does the owner want to do

211
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,199
What do we have to do

212
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,639
It turned out to be your highness

213
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,600
It seems that your highness has already made plans

214
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
As long as it is related to the little lady

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,959
Our owner

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,880
I can't wait to explain my opponent's aftermath together

217
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,959
It seems that there are not enough things arranged for you

218
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
I read that the book of flying pigeons says

219
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,199
Let me knock this Jilu out and box it

220
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,959
Then you send it back to Beijing, right

221
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,199
I'll do it right away

222
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:14,720
Wait a minute

223
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,279
Why did you knock me out

224
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,679
Because you talk too much nonsense

225
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,440
When do I

226
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:19,799
Go

227
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,440
I didn't say anything

228
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,039
I've been cooperating

229
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,599
Where are we going now

230
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
Go find Zhou Yue and Gao Mo

231
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
Go back to Beijing with them

232
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:35,159
That's right

233
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,719
About finding Jilu

234
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,919
Don't tell Gao Mo for the time being

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,159
Shall we go back to the farm now

236
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,359
I've sent them to Liangxian

237
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,599
Yingchun Inn is waiting for us

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
When did you tell them

239
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,400
Row

240
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Then I'll find my husband

241
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,560
Your Highness trouble

242
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,120
Are you so happy

243
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,799
Xianggong, I'm back

244
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,120
Fish, you're back

245
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,520
What's the matter

246
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:10,880
You see

247
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
I thought

248
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,719
What is the big event that burns your eyebrows

249
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
It turned out that Gao Mo's wood began to understand

250
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,599
You're joking

251
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Do you know

252
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,479
He sent these two things

253
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,560
What does it mean

254
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,839
It means he likes you

255
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,760
Means he probably knows

256
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,039
The identity of my daughter's family

257
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,560
Why are you so serious

258
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,159
I think with his affection for you

259
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,919
Even if he knows

260
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,960
I won't threaten you with this

261
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm afraid if he should let the cat out of the bag

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Be used by people with heart

263
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,479
You have to know

264
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,760
Pretending to be a man and entering the DPRK as an official

265
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,560
It's a capital crime

266
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:52,960
Afraid of what

267
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,159
Even if it's beheading

268
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,159
And my sister, a court prisoner, to accompany you

269
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,159
You really have

270
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,120
The ability to be a quilt cover when the sky falls

271
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,159
You're in such a good mood today

272
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,679
Go out this way

273
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,239
Did you find the murderer

274
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,479
Or

275
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,359
I found His Royal Highness King Jing

276
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,200
I found it all

277
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,039
Qi Zhang and I

278
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
Has caught our assassin

279
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,159
He is my father's long-term companion

280
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,960
Ji Lu

281
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,080
It's really him

282
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,560
He also killed Cai's mother

283
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
And he confessed to me himself

284
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,839
At the behest of He Guang

285
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,279
Replaced the soup my father gave Gao Guifei

286
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,479
This makes my family suffer

287
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,679
He Guang

288
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,359
Now the hospital envoy of Taiyuan Hospital

289
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,880
No wonder Helanya is aimed at you everywhere

290
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,279
Naji Road

291
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,679
Where are people now

292
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
At His Royal Highness King Jing's

293
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,839
But he will meet us early tomorrow morning

294
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,919
Let's go back to Beijing together

295
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,239
But

296
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:59,039
Gao Mo has found out the existence of Ji Lu

297
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,120
I'm going to Zhaojiacun to dig graves

298
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
Let him dig it

299
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,839
You take this

300
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,080
Don't get a tan

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
What are you afraid of when a man basks in the sun

302
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,159
Take it

303
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:24,960
Come on, come on

304
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,520
I played for my husband

305
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,320
Thank you

306
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,799
This high ink

307
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,440
I used to be treated like a rival in love

308
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,400
Be jealous when you see it

309
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,880
Today's attitude is so good

310
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,520
Seems

311
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,679
I really know the identity of Xiao Xianggong

312
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,159
Your Excellency

313
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,200
The coffin was opened and the bones were gone

314
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,839
The coffin was touched

315
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,400
You're not bent on solving a case

316
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,279
To clear one's name

317
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,839
Then why do you look like you don't care at all

318
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:21,719
I care

319
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,039
How could I not care

320
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,719
I'm a woman

321
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,080
You expect me to dig my own grave

322
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,039
So where did you go yesterday

323
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,440
Tall man

324
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,120
I said you don't solve the case well

325
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,159
You care about the whereabouts of your classmate's wife

326
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,080
Isn't it appropriate

327
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,520
Who cares about your whereabouts

328
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,880
I think you're sneaky

329
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,640
And King Jing

330
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,679
Why did he leave early

331
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,320
Is it the two of you

332
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,760
It's a long time ago collusion

333
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,120
High ink

334
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,359
You came to catch the assassin, didn't you catch it

335
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,479
I'm in a bad mood. I understand

336
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,120
But you put all the blame on me

337
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
It also involves His Royal Highness King Jing

338
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,400
What's the matter

339
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,640
Bully me. There is no backing behind Shen Shi, is there

340
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,200
I'm making a reasonable guess

341
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,560
That is, there is no evidence

342
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,120
What are you talking about without proof

343
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,839
You two stop arguing

344
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,479
Since I didn't find anything,

345
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,120
Then let them go back early

346
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,320
Listen

347
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,120
You listen

348
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,279
A Yue is right

349
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,640
You just got hurt yesterday

350
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,880
You should really have a good rest

351
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,599
That

352
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,239
And see what's in the grave

353
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,359
It's almost time to go down the mountain

354
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes

355
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,960
I can't see it

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,679
Gao Qingtian still has two faces

357
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,320
Go away

358
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,400
Xianggong, let's go

359
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,599
Guys, take a break

360
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,359
Good

361
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,760
Don't you come here yet

362
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,159
A fish

363
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,719
I heard Gao Mo say

364
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,599
Ji Lu and Cai are husband and wife

365
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:10,880
Yeah

366
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,440
I just found out a few days ago

367
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,320
They deliberately concealed their identities

368
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,039
Can it be said that before entering the family,

369
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,479
The people behind the scenes are already planning the layout

370
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,200
There's a good chance

371
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,520
My father is a sincere man

372
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,239
Be ill-advised

373
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,839
I devote myself to studying medical codes in my spare time

374
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,880
So the two of them are in cahoots with each other in the family

375
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,159
We didn't notice it at all

376
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
Ji Lu was caught

377
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,919
Presumably, the people behind the scenes will not give up easily

378
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,640
Fortunately, His Royal Highness King Jing returned to Beijing with us

379
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,880
I can feel more or less at ease

380
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,039
Jilu itself is not a fuel-efficient lamp

381
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,839
When we got him back,

382
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,400
He's not running away on the road

383
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,719
Is to wink at the officers and men

384
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,359
So I discussed it with Qi Zhang

385
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,080
Why don't you just pack him and take him away

386
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,200
Packing

387
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,640
It's like goods

388
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,919
It is also convenient to hide people's eyes and ears

389
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,799
That's all right

390
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,400
But what if he wakes up in the middle

391
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,560
You have a point

392
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,080
After going down the mountain, give him two injections quickly

393
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,640
It makes him want to run and can't run

394
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,760
This is very good

395
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,159
So as not to cause trouble again

396
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,520
Go away

397
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,279
Little Lady

398
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,279
General Han

399
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:52,880
Why are you here

400
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,320
What a misfortune

401
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,080
Our highness is out on business

402
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,560
Not in

403
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,880
I'm not looking for him

404
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,120
So you came to see me

405
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:02,200
I didn't come to see you either

406
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,239
Jilu has been drugged by me

407
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,120
Has passed out

408
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,560
What does the little lady want to do

409
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,159
Han someone can do it for him

410
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,159
Don't dare to neglect your highness when you are away, little lady

411
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,200
Acupuncture

412
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,080
Would you

413
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,080
I

414
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,000
There is a pig's trotters across the street that are very delicious

415
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
I'll get you one

416
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,239
Remember to take it away when you are busy later

417
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,959
You're not dizzy

418
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,680
At least I have been following Gu for so many years

419
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,160
Trying to faint me

420
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,319
It's not that easy

421
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,239
Is it

422
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
Then my father must be very pleased if he is here

423
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,719
Surely it will

424
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:32,839
Go

425
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,920
You can steal the way to solve ecstacy

426
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:41,839
Don't know

427
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,959
Now I have sealed the acupuncture points

428
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,040
Can you still solve it

429
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,120
Smelly girl

430
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:50,920
Stop

431
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:02,839
I

432
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:03,839
Go

433
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:17,640
Start and open

434
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,280
Stop and don't run

435
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:25,680
Don't run

436
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:26,920
You stop

437
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,160
Stop

438
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:31,920
Stop

439
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,040
Ji Lu

440
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,479
How did you get out

441
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,040
Where's Jilu

442
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,239
It's tied upstairs

443
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,160
That's right

444
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,439
Here comes the little lady

445
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,120
Said to give him a needle

446
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,959
I'm going to buy her some pig's trotters across the street

447
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:48,760
Let her take it back

448
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,640
So she's the only one upstairs now

449
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,520
Are you with Jilu

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,439
Right

451
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,800
What are you nervous about

452
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,199
I was so lost to him that I was already

453
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,280
Nothing can go wrong

454
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,959
Jilu is a family member

455
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,239
What if there is something wrong with ecstasy

456
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,800
It must be Ji Lu pretending to be dizzy

457
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,160
Escape while the little lady is running needles

458
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,839
My fault

459
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,199
Jilu acupoint is sealed

460
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,599
The skill is less than 30%

461
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,520
It shouldn't be far away

462
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,079
Separate search

463
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,479
Ji Lu

464
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,400
Don't hide

465
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,880
Come out

466
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,359
Qi Zhang will come with people soon

467
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,640
You come out by yourself

468
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
We all save our strength

469
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,199
We can catch you once

470
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,760
Naturally, I will catch you for the second time

471
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,280
Then I'll send you to heaven now

472
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,719
You

473
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,599
Smelly girl

474
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,559
I have to strangle you today. I

475
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,319
You get down here

476
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,800
Let you run

477
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,239
Let you run

478
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,599
Let you run

479
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,160
I must kill you today

480
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,040
Stop

481
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,680
Get up

482
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:36,959
Don't come over here

483
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,239
Come here again and I'll kill her

484
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,120
You let her go

485
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,199
You put the sword down

486
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:40,959
Put down

487
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,319
Jilu, listen to me

488
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,160
I don't want to listen to you

489
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,839
How can I hear you say

490
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,439
I heard you say that I was fooled by you again

491
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,359
You let go of your hands. Come on

492
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,880
You get your hands off me. Come on, come on, come on

493
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,719
You always stab me with a needle. You

494
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,359
You calm down

495
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm not calm. You put the sword down. Come on

496
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:53,599
I put

497
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,439
Can't put

498
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,079
You don't put it down, I stab her to death, put it down

499
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,160
Let go

500
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:58,479
Go

501
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,559
You let go

502
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,199
Where are you going

503
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,559
What are you doing

504
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,839
Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch him

505
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,280
Why did you let him go

506
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,160
Do you know how important he is to me

507
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,839
Without him, what can I do to overturn my family's conviction

508
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,719
I can't help it

509
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,800
You got a plan

510
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,400
You are the King of Northwest Scenery

511
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,319
What have you not seen

512
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,719
How can you be caught by a thief

513
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,760
You hesitated just now

514
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,880
Because I can't afford to risk failure

515
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,439
Why are you going

516
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,120
Find Jilu

517
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,040
Hello, hello

518
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,839
Excuse me, have you seen here

519
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,920
I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it

520
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,359
Hello, big brother. I want to ask about that

521
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,479
Have you seen a man

522
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,800
A man about this tall

523
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,959
Then there is a scar on the left face

524
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Have you ever seen someone in a hurry

525
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,880
I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it

526
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,079
Someone is following me

527
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:24,760
Your Highness

528
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,319
Yes

529
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,680
You guys know each other

530
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:32,520
Are you tired

531
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,479
Go up and rest

532
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:36,719
What's the matter

533
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,520
I was in a hurry this morning

534
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,959
I know you are thinking about my safety

535
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,920
But I still lose my temper with you

536
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm sorry

537
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,880
Are you apologizing

538
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,839
Apologizing

539
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,559
Let's talk about it first

540
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,280
I don't know why

541
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,120
Is to see you

542
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,959
I can't control my emotions either

543
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,239
I

544
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,439
I know you're doing it for my own good

545
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,520
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you

546
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,359
Sorry about that

547
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,359
Be able to understand

548
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:39,599
You can understand

549
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,599
Understand

550
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,559
Then you can understand

551
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,559
Then go back to rest quickly

552
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,839
Jilu hasn't been found yet

553
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:55,280
I'll look for it again

554
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,559
The man has been found

555
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,880
Is it true or not

556
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,280
Where did you find it

557
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:07,479
Where are the people now

558
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,479
Can I have a look

559
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,920
You ask so many questions at once

560
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,280
Which one should I answer first

561
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,439
Don't worry

562
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,760
The man has been found

563
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,199
You go back tonight and have a good sleep

564
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
Early tomorrow morning

565
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,040
Jilu will pack according to the original plan

566
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,160
Transport back to Beijing

567
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,000
Is it true or not

568
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,559
When did I lie to you

569
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,920
Yeah, too

570
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,680
Let me take you home

571
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,160
A Yue

572
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Why are you suddenly going back to Beijing

573
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,280
We've been out too long

574
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:53,479
Is everything ready

575
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,120
You can start at any time when you are ready

576
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,000
Good

577
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,199
Three boxes

578
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,680
It must be Qi Zhang who wants to confuse the enemy

579
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,079
The last two boxes barely echoed

580
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
Prove that it is full of goods

581
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,319
It seems that people should be in this box

582
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,280
His Highness disappeared for a few days

583
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,479
Come back and have such a big battle

584
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,359
I wonder what's in this box

585
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,040
Nothing. It's just a local specialty

586
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,559
Buy some back and give everyone a taste

587
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,439
Specialty

588
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,199
Such a big box

589
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,520
I'm afraid I'm not hiding someone.

590
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,959
Then Gao also wants to see it

591
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,439
What specialties did your highness bring

592
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,120
I also want to give it to my relatives at home

593
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,239
Pick up some

594
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,839
A Yue

595
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,520
Is this king usually too close

596
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,479
Even an assistant minister of punishments

597
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,120
I dare to search through Ben Wang's things at will

598
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,559
Your Highness

599
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,079
Tall people always speak indifferently

600
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,439
I hope your highness will not dispute with him

601
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,359
Yue, it doesn't matter

602
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,599
Let's go quickly. It's getting late.

603
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,599
Where's General Han

604
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,959
Don't come with us

605
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,839
He's already one step ahead

606
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,280
Tall people can gain something recently in investigating cases

607
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,400
These days are also strange

608
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,640
Someone always erases clues before me

609
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,239
This person's whereabouts are ghostly

610
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,239
It seems to be to compare with me in investigating cases

611
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,040
That tall man should hold fast

612
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,359
Drive

613
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,559
Drive

614
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,839
That's them

615
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,800
Brothers, give it to me

616
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,479
Here we go again

617
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:47,839
Can you change your tricks

618
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,800
Shen fish

619
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,760
If it's really some special products,

620
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,880
Just give it to them

621
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Fish, be careful

622
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,880
Go

623
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,280
Go

624
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,959
Want to snatch a wooden box

625
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,000
You kill me first

626
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,920
A fish

627
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,400
A fish

628
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,319
Don't die

629
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:25,680
Ah Yue, go quickly

630
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:26,839
A fish

631
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,439
You let go of me

632
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,199
A fish

633
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,479
Get in there

634
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,599
What about the King of Scenery

635
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,280
Quickly

636
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,160
Drive

637
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,920
Guys, they're going to run. Chase me

638
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:00,880
What to do

639
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,439
Stop chasing

640
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,920
Qi Zhang can't give them Ji Lu

641
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,160
Then we will fall short

642
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,040
You let go of me

643
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:05,959
Shen fish

644
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,439
We are now outnumbered

645
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,239
There is not much chance of winning

646
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,239
You let me go, Qi Zhang

647
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:09,839
Red flame

648
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,000
You put

649
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:14,719
Go

650
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:20,959
Drive

651
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,400
Drive

652
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,000
Qi Zhang

653
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,760
You put me down quickly

654
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,120
I'm going back to Jilu

655
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,479
Stop it

656
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,959
If you don't let me down again

657
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,760
I vaulted

658
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,239
Come

659
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,640
Don't go

660
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,520
What happened to your eyes

661
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:51,959
There must be poison on the dart just now

662
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:52,719
Let me see

663
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,439
Don't move

664
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,959
It's Yuhua green poison

665
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:09,239
Don't move

666
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,839
What is this

667
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,120
Temporarily suppressing toxins

668
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,959
But we also need to find herbs as soon as possible

669
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,359
Although this poison

670
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,000
Won't kill you right away

671
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,280
But if because of accelerated motion

672
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,479
Words flowing all over the body

673
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:28,000
No one can really save you then

674
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,400
So serious

675
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,800
Is this the veil I gave you

676
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,359
Don't move

677
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,480
Horseshoe sound

678
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,279
Someone is coming

679
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,160
The man in black is coming back again

680
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,680
What shall we do then

681
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
You whip and let the red flame go first

682
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:03,319
Go quickly

683
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,559
You are terrible

684
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,640
You sell your own horse

685
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,920
Red Flame has undergone professional training

686
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,160
Self-avoidance

687
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,599
Not as stupid as you

688
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,880
Yes

689
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,120
Your Royal Highness King Jing is the most resourceful, isn't he

690
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:36,960
You're not my enemy

691
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,200
Let's just go

692
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,519
It is not advisable to stay here for a long time

693
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,799
Around here

694
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,440
I do know a place

695
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,519
They can't find it

696
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,359
But the mountain road is rugged and difficult to walk

697
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,599
You're hurt again

698
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,599
How can I take you a little blind man

699
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,079
Talking to you

700
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,999
Accelerated motion

701
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,519
Will be poisoned and die

702
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,120
So

703
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:13,759
Let's go

704
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,120
A Yue

705
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,359
Are you all right

706
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,720
I'm okay

707
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:34,200
What's the matter

708
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,359
Nothing

709
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:50,640
Where am I

710
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,559
I have no idea

711
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,880
The situation was dangerous just now

712
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,880
I can only drive a car

713
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,039
Run straight ahead

714
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,799
I don't know, fish

715
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,759
Is it safe now

716
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:05,799
Can you work on your own?

717
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:06,880
Slow down

718
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,640
Any sooner I'm going to die of poison

719
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,039
It's the eye that hurts

720
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,160
It's not a leg

721
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,160
I think you are deliberately cheating

722
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,680
Accelerated motion

723
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,279
I'll be poisoned to death

724
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:17,440
You said it yourself

725
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,160
My leg is numb

726
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,680
Use a little energy

727
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,200
Qi Zhang

728
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,680
You can rest assured

729
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,440
She is guarded by King Jing

730
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,319
Nothing will go wrong

731
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,440
So where are we going now

732
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,599
A Yue

733
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,400
Let's go up the hill

734
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,519
Up the hill

735
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,200
Right

736
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Make sure you eat and drink well

737
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:57,359
Let's go

738
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:14,559
Finally came back

739
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,799
Come back

740
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,160
Where is this

741
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,319
This is a place I am familiar with

742
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,640
There are many detoxification herbs around here

743
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,999
You wait for me here

744
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,319
I'll look for it for you

745
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,039
Don't be afraid

746
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:34,920
It's safe

747
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,799
They can't find this

748
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:36,480
Jokes

749
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,359
This king will be afraid

750
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,120
You sit down and wait for me for a while

751
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,960
I'll be right back

752
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,160
Go quickly

753
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,999
Point in the wrong direction

754
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:47,480
Fool

755
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,200
Who

756
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,240
Pain, pain, pain

757
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,120
It's you

758
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,200
I said it hurts

759
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,319
Why are you so defensive?

760
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,640
I was going to tease you

761
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:22,359
I thought

762
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:23,999
They just came over

763
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:25,120
I'm sorry

764
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,400
Forget it

765
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,680
Who let me adults have a lot of

766
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
Don't care about it like you

767
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,160
I thought I told you to wait outside

768
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,039
Why did you come in by yourself

769
00:40:36,759 --> 00:40:37,759
You said it was familiar here

770
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:38,680
So I thought

771
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,319
Just walk around

772
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:43,640
You

773
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,839
Have you picked any herbs

774
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,079
Got it

775
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,240
I'll I'll give you the medicine

776
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,079
All right

777
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,640
Two hours later

778
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,680
The poison will be solved naturally

779
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,079
Two hours

780
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,160
So soon

781
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,039
Of course

782
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,240
I have good medical skills

783
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,480
I have a good way of treating people's eyes

784
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:37,799
Do you treat many people's eyes

785
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,799
I'm a doctor

786
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,319
Of course, I have treated many people's eyes

787
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Are there any patients you are more impressed with

788
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,079
Impressive

789
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,519
Yes

790
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:48,079
Talk about it

791
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,559
Let me tell you something

792
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,200
That's a monk with a scabby head

793
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:53,880
It's really a full head of scabies

794
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:55,839
I have spent my whole life learning

795
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,160
He was finally cured

796
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,120
Now I think of his sore head

797
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,920
I'm still a little bit

798
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,400
That's it

799
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,759
But if the most impressive person

800
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,960
Or did I save a little boy before

801
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,279
He was born beautifully

802
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:13,359
Just like you, it is also an eye disease

803
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,480
A little boy

804
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:16,920
Yeah

805
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,279
My master and I are in the utmost optimism

806
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:20,999
He was treated for a long time for eye diseases

807
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,240
But then

808
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,519
What happened afterwards

809
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,319
I never saw it again

810
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,759
Why

811
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,839
Remember that time

812
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:40,079
He has poor eyesight

813
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,519
I always call him a little blind man

814
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,759
I can't believe you are really

815
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
The stubborn boy who saved me in those days
