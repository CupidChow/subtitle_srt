1
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
What are you doing

2
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,201
Oh, no. I forgot to lock the door

3
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,000
Zhou Yue

4
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,201
Unexpectedly

5
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,360
You keep such a big secret

6
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:17,680
Secret

7
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,201
What secret

8
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,881
You can't hide it from everyone. You can't hide it from me

9
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,401
Let me explain to you

10
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,680
What is this

11
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,800
You hid another woman's comb

12
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,640
I said you wouldn't let me into your room

13
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,721
That is, the golden house hides charming, isn't it

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,120
Zhou Yue, you let me down so much

15
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,401
What are you thinking

16
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,401
Can't a man comb his hair

17
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
My mother gave me that comb

18
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,921
It turned out to be a misunderstanding

19
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,080
I told you, my little Xianggong

20
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,361
How can it be that kind of person

21
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,760
Then rest quickly. I won't bother you

22
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,881
You haven't answered me yet

23
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:55,921
What are you doing in my room

24
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,040
This is not

25
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,281
We've been married for so long

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,361
Not yet

27
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:03,840
You'd better think it over

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,760
Since you entered my Zhou house,

29
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,641
First roof eavesdropping

30
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:10,921
After that, I met King Jing in the middle of the night

31
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,480
Now I feel in my room and look around

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,440
If the reasons you give don't convince me,

33
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,440
So our deal

34
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,480
It can also end here

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
Do you want it to be so serious

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,881
Then you can let me say it

37
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,921
You answer me a question first

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,440
You said

39
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,201
Qi Zhang is your cousin

40
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,120
Then why was it at the Bronze Bird Building

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,201
You have to pretend you don't know him

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,840
What's your secret

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,241
There is still enmity

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,760
None of them

45
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:48,800
Really

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,520
Of course

47
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,600
It is because there is nothing

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,880
That's why I don't care why he approached you

49
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:55,600
And

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,760
He obviously doesn't want to be identified

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,281
Why should I expose it

52
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,161
Look at this little Xianggong's expression

53
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:03,721
It's not like lying.

54
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,521
It's okay to tell him

55
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,161
After all, what you don't say

56
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:09,240
I'm going to be kicked out of the house

57
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
You come to my room

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
It's for King Jing

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,081
What is it

60
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:19,921
This

61
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:35,201
This sword is really good

62
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,641
It's a pity that this week at home

63
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,081
It can only be used as an ornament

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,840
Who said you must hold a blade and sword

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,001
To kill

66
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,320
So you are at Renzhou's house

67
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:52,801
Eat and drink

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,120
Just want to see if they don't use swords

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,320
Can you kill someone

70
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:58,600
Deliberately avoid suspicion

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,320
It will only make the old lady defend against me

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,081
Make sense

73
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,721
That's right

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,561
Is there any movement in that little girl

75
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:13,001
You said that wonderful man

76
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,040
I listened to your analysis

77
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,960
I also think it is reasonable for you to enter Zhou's house

78
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,081
Why do I now think you

79
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,320
Have ulterior motives

80
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't admit it yet

81
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,400
This week's home is your home

82
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,001
You tell the old lady

83
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,680
You want to go into your mother's room and have a look

84
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,040
What's so hard about this

85
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,680
Why do you have to let the little lady

86
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Steal the key for you

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,161
Only to catch the old lady by surprise

88
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,921
I can see what I want to see

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,161
There is some truth in your sophistry

90
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,880
It's just that there's one thing I don't know

91
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,921
Why is this key in Zhou Yue's hand

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,880
Is there something fishy about it

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,201
Don't know

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,081
Let's take the key first

95
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,241
It turned out that King Jing suddenly visited

96
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:04,440
It's for this

97
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,000
Xianggong

98
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,081
Don't be puzzled

99
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,201
I'm going back to the big rooster

100
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,641
I said I'm not doing this deal

101
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,201
I can give him something

102
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,841
Please go out and wait for me for a moment

103
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,201
Go ahead

104
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,440
A fish

105
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
You come and sit down

106
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,681
Come here

107
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,081
What do you want in the future

108
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:23,241
Say it to me

109
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Really

110
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:29,801
Xianggong

111
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,521
You mean you can't take it yourself, right

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,600
I understand

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,241
Got it

114
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,121
You and King Jing

115
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:38,560
Xianggong

116
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:39,641
If you still mind

117
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,361
My business relationship with him

118
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,480
I'll break it right away

119
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:43,720
Anyway, you two

120
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,361
I choose you

121
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,121
I didn't mean to let you make a choice

122
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,280
You and I are pretending to be husband and wife

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,201
And I don't have the right

124
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,921
Let you give up your own interests

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,961
And

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,921
Affection

127
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:59,280
Me and the big rooster

128
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:01,160
Xianggong

129
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,201
I really only have a business relationship with him

130
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,361
Between the two of us

131
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:06,121
In addition to gold, it is a silver ticket

132
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,000
In addition

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Nothing else

134
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,961
Really

135
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,560
Really

136
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,201
Xianggong

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,280
Are you jealous

138
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,280
Is it for my happy daughter-in-law

139
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,440
Love has a special liking for a long time

140
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,320
Talk nonsense again

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,401
Take your things and go quickly

142
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:29,480
Right

143
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,121
That big cock

144
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,121
Have you set a time for me?

145
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:32,241
Then I'll go

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,320
Go

147
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,280
I took the risk of delivering the keys

148
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,121
I can't believe I broke my promise

149
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:10,600
Add money

150
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,720
Things haven't been given to Ben Wang yet

151
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:15,921
Where are you going

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,081
When did you come

153
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,600
All the time

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,121
Then why didn't you respond to me just now

155
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,961
You are the king of birds, not a bird

156
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:27,760
How to respond to you

157
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,081
The spy joint doesn't learn to call birds

158
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,160
What do you mean by learning

159
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:34,681
You're gonna make me shout

160
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,801
His Royal Highness King Jing

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,880
Come out quickly

162
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,841
I got what you asked me to steal

163
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:39,480
In this way

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,401
The Zhou family didn't dare to do anything to me anyway

165
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:43,681
As for you

166
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,801
You can give it a try

167
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,440
How did you get this key

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,440
Of course it is

169
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,720
Sell hue

170
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,320
Nausea

171
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:11,681
What's up

172
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,201
This boudoir is fun

173
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:16,800
How can human relations become disgusting again

174
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,161
Foul language in public

175
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:20,240
Even showing off

176
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,081
What about shame

177
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,721
Isn't it just me and you

178
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,201
Not afraid, you know

179
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,601
My husband is now being treated by me

180
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,161
Is completely fascinated

181
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,281
Isn't this

182
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:31,800
I heard I was coming to get my keys

183
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
Just give it to me

184
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,800
Be fascinated by you

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,841
He gave it to you on his own initiative

186
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:39,680
Right

187
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,281
My husband is treating me now

188
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,401
That's giving everything you want

189
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,440
Love and listen to what you say

190
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,000
This king advises you

191
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,481
Don't get too proud

192
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:53,041
Be careful that happiness begets sorrow

193
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,601
How can I be so happy

194
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,041
Why didn't I finish my words

195
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,161
Nausea

196
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,320
It's not enough for me to be a spy

197
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,680
Run to Zhou's house by yourself

198
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:08,161
I'd like to see what the secret is

199
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,601
I didn't expect this week in Houfu

200
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:29,081
There is such an old house

201
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,360
So many orchids

202
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,041
Inside Zhou Hou Fu

203
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,521
One by one is not good at calculation

204
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,440
Is petty

205
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,440
There are such calm people

206
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,041
Love the gentleman in this flower alone

207
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,000
What's wrong with him

208
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:00,601
Whose room is this

209
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,641
Scared me to death

210
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm sorry

211
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
Go the wrong way

212
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,800
You followed me

213
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:51,760
Who is following you

214
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,320
I came out to admire the moon

215
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,680
That's really strange

216
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,721
The moon is not hanging in the sky tonight

217
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:57,920
Run into the house

218
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm opening the door to the point.

219
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
I just came to see what you're up to

220
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,920
I gave you the key

221
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,320
In case you want to kill the Zhou family for money,

222
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,760
I must distance myself from each other

223
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:08,081
Distinguish the relationship

224
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,481
Do you think it's still too late

225
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,000
Didn't say let me out

226
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,481
It should be possible to follow the past and have a look

227
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:42,680
Looks like

228
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,601
It's a woman's boudoir

229
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:45,920
Whose is it

230
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,721
And the piano

231
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:02,721
Don't move

232
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,760
So nervous

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,201
Murphy

234
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
It's your sweetheart's room

235
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
By default

236
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Let me guess

237
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,281
It must be you and

238
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:19,880
Which woman in the Zhou family is in love

239
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:21,201
And then what

240
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:22,601
With you at that time

241
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,401
No soldier, no right

242
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,401
And no money

243
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,800
So I was met

244
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,920
Mrs. Zhou's Stick Beats Mandarin Duck

245
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,000
So I have always held a grudge against her

246
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:33,120
Right

247
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,440
Default again

248
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:40,000
No wonder you bribed me at a high price

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
Let me be close to Mrs. Zhou

250
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,641
In order to wait for an opportunity to retaliate, isn't it

251
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,800
He stares at me like this

252
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,760
Must have been stunned by my amazing talent

253
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,920
There are such stupid people in the world

254
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,041
Don't know it yet

255
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,721
Presumably you and that week's girl

256
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:03,161
It must be love to death

257
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,161
Stop guessing

258
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,120
This is my mother's room

259
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,641
Princess Zhou You of Xianjing

260
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:14,360
Yes

261
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:17,440
Then I've seen it too

262
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,641
Shengshi Hongyan said this in this book

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Daqi Centennial Prosperity Beauty

264
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,481
Zhou's daughter

265
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,680
Where do you hear all this from

266
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,560
If it's so hot, who hasn't seen it

267
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,481
Although it was later checked by the government

268
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,641
I can't sing anymore

269
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,601
But it is also all the rage

270
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,240
It's about the only daughter of a teacher

271
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,481
A childhood sweetheart of the emperor

272
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:42,281
In the end, I almost became a queen

273
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:43,601
What childhood sweetheart

274
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,601
My grandfather once worshipped a teacher

275
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,800
He is the teacher when the emperor sneaked into the mansion today

276
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,320
So they met several times

277
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,961
But only a few times

278
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,880
So stop spreading it

279
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,161
I didn't pass it on either

280
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,560
Why are you so cruel to me

281
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,920
Can you do this

282
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,041
My mission is complete

283
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,041
Give me back my keys. I'll go back to bed

284
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,240
I don't agree with you

285
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:50,961
Every time I meet you,

286
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,841
Can wander on the edge of being discovered

287
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,680
Would you stop following me

288
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:19,240
Double remuneration

289
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,760
With this king's understanding of Zhou Yue,

290
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,000
Since she is willing

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,560
Take the initiative to hand over this key

292
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,601
It must be for the king's sake

293
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:28,641
So this single business

294
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,161
This king can only give it to Mrs. Zhou

295
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,161
A little bit of errands

296
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:33,560
You set me up

297
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:35,481
Don't be too greedy

298
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,721
Be careful to be like an old lady

299
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,081
Greedy words become poor words

300
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:41,800
What else is there

301
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:43,641
I'm especially curious

302
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,120
You and the old lady after all

303
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,440
What kind of hatred? What kind of hatred

304
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,881
Take my husband before

305
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,001
Donated half a fortune

306
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,280
She's already half angry

307
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
It's not enough

308
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,320
Not enough

309
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,160
What do you mean

310
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
A thousand taels

311
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,121
With what

312
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:57,201
You give me a thousand taels

313
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,361
I'll take it out for you

314
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
Five Grannies

315
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,440
The old lady told me

316
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,520
Zhou's rule is to show women's morality

317
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,961
The bride should be above the banquet

318
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,040
Show your cooking skills

319
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,241
Today's banquet for His Royal Highness King Jing

320
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,640
Don't be late

321
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:17,601
Stop shouting. Why are you shouting

322
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,800
Can't you see Grandma Five hasn't woken up yet

323
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,881
I don't know what you're yelling about

324
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,800
It's late in the morning

325
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,081
Whose bride sleeps at this hour

326
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,560
This, this is too outrageous

327
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,320
Keep your voice down. Keep your voice down

328
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,601
Why do you care so much

329
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,481
Really

330
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,601
I'm worried about not having a chance

331
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:35,320
You found this by yourselves

332
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
Ask Mammy to go back and tell Grandma

333
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,481
Say that grandson's daughter-in-law has already got up

334
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:45,640
This is to bathe and cook

335
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
And then I won't let her down

336
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,320
So happy

337
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:51,560
Transsexual

338
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:04,680
Chen Qi Zhang

339
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:06,520
Knock on the emperor

340
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,481
The emperor, the emperor

341
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,201
Flat body

342
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,320
Thank the Emperor

343
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,881
Gentleman with bandits

344
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:40,640
As gold as tin

345
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:42,241
I

346
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:43,680
Year

347
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,361
When visiting Yongzhou,

348
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,520
You're still

349
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,761
A drooping teenager

350
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,800
Now

351
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,201
You have inherited the throne of King Jing

352
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:54,920
And Yongzhou

353
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:57,520
It is Zhongan Daotai

354
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,481
If a hero is a teenager,

355
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:03,040
False praise of the emperor

356
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,280
All this

357
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,680
But relying on the blessings of the emperor

358
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:09,320
You're supposed to be

359
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,961
Born in the first year of Yong'an, right

360
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,241
Yes

361
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,841
What month is it

362
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:17,961
Return to the Emperor

363
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,721
On the tenth day of November in the first year of Yong'an

364
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,081
November

365
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:26,881
According to my father

366
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,241
Emperor Long En also rewarded him in those days

367
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:32,800
Yeah

368
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,841
King of King Youhou

369
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,640
It was a happy event for the country

370
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,881
White jade is not destroyed

371
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,241
Who is Gui Zhang

372
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:47,081
And your parents

373
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,520
The high hopes I have placed on you

374
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,800
I will remember my parents' orders

375
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,761
Worthy of the emperor's grace, worthy of the heart

376
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,361
Ning Wang to

377
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,761
My brother visits the emperor

378
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:19,201
King Ning

379
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,520
King Jing is courteous

380
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,961
The border has been restless recently

381
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:30,481
Detectives from all walks of life sneaked into me

382
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:33,881
King Jing did not come to Beijing according to the established route

383
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:37,721
I'm very worried about the delay for several days

384
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,320
Wang Laoning is worried about it

385
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,640
There are some twists and turns on the road

386
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,881
But fortunately

387
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,241
Be narrowly missed

388
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,640
That's good that's good

389
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,800
King Jing is the pillar of my great enlightenment

390
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,481
The Lord of Yongzhou People

391
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,961
But be careful

392
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,761
Ning Wang's words are heavy

393
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,481
Is it the king's land under the whole world

394
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,400
People all over the world return to their hearts

395
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,761
They all surrender to the emperor's saint

396
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:11,881
Sage of the Emperor

397
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,920
You, me, monarch and minister are United

398
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,560
It is the blessing of my great enlightenment

399
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,640
King of Scenery

400
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:22,361
You came to Beijing this time

401
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
Where to live

402
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,241
Return to the Emperor

403
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:26,961
Jingwang Mansion is still under repair

404
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,121
My brother has sent out an invitation

405
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,241
Choose a house for King Jing

406
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,680
Don't bother the king with such small things

407
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,001
Emperor

408
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,440
The Zhou family is the minister's foreign family

409
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,280
I have moved into Zhou Fu

410
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,800
You just said that

411
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,560
After all, Zhou's family was a foreigner

412
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,121
Naturally, there are many inconveniences

413
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,440
How about this

414
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:52,800
The brocade garden in the eastern suburbs is still empty

415
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:56,121
Why don't you just settle down first

416
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,160
Thank the Emperor

417
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:01,160
You will soon reach the crown, too

418
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,881
The children of the royal family in Beijing have reached your age

419
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,201
There are all the children

420
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:10,881
Take this opportunity to arrange a flower party

421
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:14,121
You also meet the boudoir in Beijing

422
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:16,761
If there is a consensus

423
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:18,961
I

424
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:21,361
Give you a marriage

425
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,520
It's all arranged by the emperor

426
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,241
Why did the emperor ask you about your birthday

427
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,800
Your heart is unpredictable

428
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,040
You just have to remember

429
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,841
I will be born in November from now on

430
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:47,001
The emperor also gave me a garden

431
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,881
This is a reminder to me

432
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,721
Let me move out of Zhoufu as soon as possible

433
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,680
It's better to move out

434
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,881
So that the Zhou family can relax their vigilance

435
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,560
But

436
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,640
What about your little lady

437
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,361
Speaking of her, I remember

438
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:07,081
I spent a thousand taels

439
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,520
Shen Yu said that he would let me watch the excitement today

440
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,160
There is excitement

441
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,761
I like watching the fun best. Go quickly

442
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:49,361
Emperor

443
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,601
You and I

444
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:10,601
Get to know each other at a young time

445
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,320
There has also been the beauty of the piano and the harp in the royal court

446
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,040
Why

447
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,560
You have been so cold to me now

448
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,920
Why is love

449
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:32,440
Don't the emperor himself know

450
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:43,680
Good

451
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,961
Then I'll ask you one last time

452
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,121
Is Qi Zhang my son

453
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,761
Isn't the emperor already

454
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,121
Have you investigated his birthday

455
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,160
I

456
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,640
I want to hear you say it yourself

457
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,081
Zhang Er is the son of my father and me

458
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:24,761
The emperor is worried too much

459
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,800
Princess

460
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:38,841
Will the emperor be unfavorable to the young master

461
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,121
Affectionate must be unaffectionate

462
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,680
Willfulness does not lose sex

463
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,721
He won't

464
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,280
Total victory

465
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,201
Send someone to kill Qi Zhang for me

466
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:18,680
Why don't you advise me

467
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,081
The emperor forgives the old slave for being talkative

468
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,440
I don't know how many times the emperor has said this

469
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,241
According to a slave

470
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,961
This scene is the eyebrow eye of His Royal Highness

471
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,440
With your Majesty

472
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,121
It is simply carved out of the same mold

473
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,920
How could you kill him

474
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,440
Is it carved out of the same mold

475
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,920
You can see clearly

476
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,241
False praise of the emperor

477
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:59,440
Slaves can only see clearly from time to time

478
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,640
Sometimes I can't see clearly

479
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,721
Then you today

480
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,961
Can't see what clearly

481
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,241
The slave thought

482
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,440
This

483
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,320
The King of Ning

484
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,201
I have no contact with His Royal Highness King Jing at ordinary times

485
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,961
But why do you care so much today

486
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,520
Maybe it's this

487
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,320
Caused by royal blood

488
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,440
King Jeanine

489
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,081
So concerned

490
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:27,440
Heart of King Ning

491
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,920
I

492
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,800
How to not know

493
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,800
That nature

494
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:36,121
No matter how deep things in this world are hidden,

495
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,560
I can't escape your eyes, the emperor

496
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,920
I don't know your highness King Jing

497
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,361
Life in Beijing

498
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:04,601
Recoverable adaptability

499
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,800
The Zhou family has everything to eat and wear

500
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,040
This king is still reluctant to leave

501
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:13,841
If King Jing is willing to stay

502
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,601
Just stay a few more days

503
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,320
Good

504
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:18,800
Brother Qi Zhang

505
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:21,520
You haven't visited Beijing since you came to Beijing, have you

506
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,961
I'll show you around someday

507
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,280
Don't bother Miss Three

508
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,241
Not in the way

509
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,440
Can be with Qi Zhang's brother

510
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,920
It's too late for me to be happy

511
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:35,001
It seems that there are still people who haven't come

512
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,280
Duke a few days ago

513
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,121
I took Zhou Lin to Xishan

514
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,201
When he comes back

515
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:43,241
Just give His Royal Highness King Jing another reception

516
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,160
No harm

517
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,280
Goro and his third wife

518
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,440
The emperor's seal has come down

519
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,040
Goro was assigned to the punishments department

520
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,241
Take office today

521
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,121
The third lady is unwell

522
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:54,520
I ate in the room

523
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:56,361
Well, congratulations to the old lady

524
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:57,961
This Goro went to the punishments department

525
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:59,121
Have real power

526
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:01,121
When the time comes, make a world

527
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,560
The lintel of this week's house

528
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,481
May have to rely on him to revitalize

529
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:12,001
Lord Shangshu

530
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:19,841
Good

531
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,001
Zhou Lang is really a good-looking person

532
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:26,481
The heavy responsibility of my criminal department in the future

533
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,280
It will still be handed over to you young people

534
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,761
You have to work hard.

535
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:31,680
Lord Xie encouraged

536
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,881
Let me introduce you

537
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,400
These are Zhao Langzhong and Qian Langzhong

538
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:40,160
Your Excellencies are courteous

539
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:41,800
Be courteous

540
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,001
A Yue

541
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:45,920
You really came to the punishments department. That's great

542
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
Tall man

543
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,400
You two know each other well

544
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,920
That would be good

545
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,081
Assistant Minister Gao came a year before you

546
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,040
You can ask him if you have any questions

547
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,241
Your Excellency, please rest assured

548
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:01,761
I have a close relationship with Ayue

549
00:32:01,761 --> 00:32:03,400
I will definitely take what I have learned all my life

550
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,920
Teach it all to him

551
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,640
Although he is more talented than me,

552
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,280
Slightly inferior

553
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,961
But as long as you are willing to work hard,

554
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,241
There is still a future

555
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,280
Assistant Minister Gao seems to have just taken a case

556
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:19,841
If it is convenient for you in Zhou Lang

557
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,481
You can work with him

558
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,361
Just get familiar with it

559
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,201
The case handling process of our criminal department

560
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,680
Convenient

561
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:27,920
A Yue has just come to Beijing

562
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:29,800
I don't have any friends

563
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:31,481
I'm sure I can attend

564
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,520
But according to the distribution of Shangshu adults

565
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,920
Good

566
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:42,361
Go ahead

567
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:44,841
Speaking of Goro

568
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,520
Your mother was best friends with Goro's father before her death

569
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:54,160
You two should not be identified.

570
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,481
There is such a thing

571
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:56,680
How many years

572
00:32:57,721 --> 00:33:01,481
In those years, Goro's father was guarding the border

573
00:33:01,721 --> 00:33:04,081
I often send letters and gifts back

574
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:06,280
To your unmarried mother

575
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,881
It's a pity

576
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,241
What a pity

577
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,640
Don't say it. Don't say it

578
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:22,361
The brother and sister stumbled

579
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,121
That's what happens all the time

580
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:28,481
There are a few people who don't have bad blood

581
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,680
What the old lady said is

582
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,881
My maiden sister and brother

583
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:34,361
Or a mother sibling

584
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,081
As a result, because of some money disputes,

585
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,440
I actually moved a knife

586
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:40,440
Almost killed people

587
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,241
Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it

588
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:46,121
Coming, coming

589
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,841
Are you waiting in a hurry

590
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:52,721
I also prepared dishes

591
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:54,081
Can you get on the table

592
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:56,481
Don't eat Qi Zhang's brother's body

593
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,320
Third sister, you are absolutely right

594
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,241
So ah

595
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:02,001
I can only use my expertise

596
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:04,201
A medicated diet was prepared for everyone

597
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,440
Third sister

598
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,800
I think you usually have a heavy tone

599
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,400
My mouth stinks badly

600
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,761
So, I prepared a copy for you

601
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,440
Qingrequhuoxiaoqingxin Decoction

602
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,241
Guarantee the right medicine to get rid of the disease

603
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,961
Sister must drink more

604
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:24,081
Old lady

605
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:29,241
This is the decoction for clearing liver and reducing desire for you

606
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,920
I usually see you

607
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,201
There is too much bloodshot in these eyes

608
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,601
Thinking that too much greed should hurt the liver

609
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,560
That's why I made you this bowl of soup

610
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:40,800
Old lady

611
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,440
Sun Daughter-in-law thinks so

612
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:45,841
Sun Daughter-in-law thinks so

613
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:48,961
You can't take anyone with you when you die.

614
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,280
Let go and drink more soup

615
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,160
Where's the big aunt

616
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,961
Your symptoms are actually similar to those of an old lady

617
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,640
I think the old lady is getting old

618
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,920
Can't drink so much

619
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,160
Just pick up her drink

620
00:35:01,361 --> 00:35:03,440
Anyway, you are usually willing to pick up people's teeth

621
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,001
What am I talking about

622
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:10,280
Is with the old lady wholeheartedly

623
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,440
So I'm sure I won't abandon her

624
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:13,601
Right

625
00:35:20,881 --> 00:35:21,800
These two copies

626
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,560
It's for your highness

627
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,001
And Mr. Han

628
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,560
Then mine also has a name

629
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:29,800
Of course

630
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,241
Shuxin Jieqi Decoction

631
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:32,361
How it suits you

632
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:33,961
Very good

633
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:37,601
Don't eat

634
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:39,400
What kind of medicated diet

635
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,721
Put on airs and be nonsense

636
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,800
You have a bad temper again, your child

637
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,640
Just now, I said to go out with your highness

638
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,640
If you are like this, who will dare to go out with you

639
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,041
I won't be like this with Qi Zhang's brother

640
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:59,241
Sure, I'll take it out on you here

641
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,521
I can't believe you want to hang out with Zhou Yihui

642
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:03,840
Come and taste it

643
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:07,400
It suddenly occurred to me

644
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
I added shepherd's purse to this medicated diet

645
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,680
It is better to take less for people with kidney deficiency

646
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,321
Your Highness, you'd better stop drinking

647
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:26,680
Yue, do you know

648
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,880
I was worried to death when I heard that you donated the official

649
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,120
I thought you were going to be released

650
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,321
I didn't expect you to work with me in the punishments department

651
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,321
That's wonderful

652
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:35,001
We can be together again

653
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:36,201
Keep a distance

654
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,801
All right

655
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,120
I have been away from Beijing for a long time

656
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,440
Is the official donation regulation adjusted

657
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:45,080
Why did I come to the punishments department to take up my post

658
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:48,001
Is it you

659
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,160
Not me

660
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,160
It's really not me

661
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,721
Although my aunt is the imperial concubine in the palace, isn't she

662
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,281
But you also know that

663
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,680
After the Xiaorong Wang case,

664
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,281
The Gaos have plummeted

665
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,961
I wish I had the ability

666
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:03,400
I can keep you by my side

667
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,080
I didn't say it had to be you

668
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,961
What is the case to be investigated later

669
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,561
You tell me in advance

670
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm so prepared

671
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,920
Minor case

672
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,961
One student got into a fight with another

673
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:15,840
Was pushed down the stairs and seriously injured

674
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:17,321
Silly

675
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,400
So serious

676
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,201
No wonder that man is coming to complain

677
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:22,640
Wrong

678
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,001
It was the man who pushed people who complained

679
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,880
Let's go

680
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,481
What are you doing

681
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,440
What do you mean

682
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,400
Let's call it a day for our deal

683
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,321
It can be over

684
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:42,840
Why

685
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:44,721
Zhou's family is your family

686
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,880
That Zhou Yihui flirted with you

687
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,600
What kind of spy did you hire me for

688
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,801
How nice it would be for you to go to Zhou's house directly

689
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:51,961
Don't say it's a key

690
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,561
Your whole Zhou family is yours

691
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,880
How to do it is my business

692
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,880
You just take money to do things

693
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:01,281
I won't earn your money. I won't play

694
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:03,440
Come on, what the hell is the reason

695
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:05,801
What if you're the king

696
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,201
Look at Yi Hui's mung bean last week

697
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,080
She will become my employer in the future

698
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,880
I can't pass this day in the future

699
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,920
Because of this

700
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,801
Do you really regard me as a spy in Jingwangfu

701
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,241
Do you mean to say that you will leave as soon as you come

702
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:27,080
King Ben tells you

703
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,440
You can't get away now

704
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,001
What do you want to do

705
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:34,041
Just under the eyes of the public

706
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,481
You said Ben Wang had

707
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,521
Deficiency of kidney

708
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,360
Makes me very unhappy

709
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,920
Now

710
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,201
You can either continue to work for Ben Wang

711
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,521
Or

712
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,201
Lose money

713
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,880
It is impossible

714
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,481
I forgot to tell you

715
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,481
This king never gives the living a third option

716
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:02,961
Owner

717
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,201
Don't be angry

718
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,481
I'm joking

719
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:07,721
Then the whole big start up and down

720
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,680
I can't find a second person better than you

721
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,360
How can I be willing to be second-minded

722
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,761
It's best if you don't have second thoughts

723
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:15,920
Ben Wang will assign you the next task now

724
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,840
Let the old lady tell you everything

725
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,201
Big Brother

726
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:24,761
I just made that screwdriver half popular

727
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,680
You let me be good with them now

728
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,761
It can't be

729
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,041
I can't do it

730
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,241
So

731
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,600
You still chose the third option

732
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,521
I'll try

733
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Then why are you still standing still

734
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,761
This fish makes trouble all day

735
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:04,360
Today, I heard that

736
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,360
She scolded all the people who went to the room

737
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:09,321
I'm afraid she will get into trouble sooner or later

738
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:11,440
Xianggong

739
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:16,761
I made ginseng soup for you and your wife to tonic

740
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:19,241
Come on in

741
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,001
Fish, what can I do for you

742
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
Xianggong

743
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,400
I want to go out and do things

744
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,521
Why do you have to do things all of a sudden

745
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,561
I don't want to live on my husband all the time

746
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,801
Let's talk about Houmen Palace

747
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:45,281
I don't have the backing of my maiden

748
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:46,281
I was thinking

749
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,481
If I can make a living by myself,

750
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,640
It's also a dignity for yourself

751
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,600
But after all, you are the fifth housewife of the Zhou family

752
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,440
If people know that you are working outside,

753
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:58,840
I'm afraid it's disgraceful to spread it

754
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,961
It doesn't matter if I keep it at home

755
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,241
The point is

756
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,961
I'm afraid to make trouble for Xianggong and his wife

757
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,360
Run into great trouble

758
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,801
There is some truth in what Ah Yu said

759
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,521
It's a pity that I can't be an official again

760
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:19,600
Otherwise

761
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,241
I also want to go to a place like the punishments department

762
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,400
Enough style

763
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,640
This can avoid going to the room again

764
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:27,600
It won't be too shameful

765
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,521
Speaking of it

766
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,201
For the convenience of entering the inner courtyard of Gaomen, the punishments department

767
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:34,400
Record the testimony of a woman

768
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
There is a female position

769
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:40,160
But most of them are poor women

770
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,321
There is no grade either

771
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:43,001
You will inevitably get involved when you go.

772
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,321
I don't care if I'm tired after I've gone out to do things.

773
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,801
Besides, go to the punishments department

774
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,400
Isn't there a little Xianggong

775
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,481
This is also a husband singing along with his wife

776
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:57,120
Then I'll try

777
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,400
That's great

778
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,600
Finally, I can enter the criminal department to contact the file

779
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,801
Is it really Mrs. Zhou

780
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:09,880
Deliberately pointing your mother's story to the third room

781
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,241
It's just an ordinary letter from home

782
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,521
This is a letter from Zhou Yue's father to my mother

783
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,440
The handwriting on it

784
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:47,521
With the one who invited my mother to Beijing

785
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:49,400
The letter from home has the same handwriting

786
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,600
Are you suspecting

787
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,360
Princess's disappearance is related to Zhou Yue's father

788
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:00,761
At least someone wants me to think so

789
00:43:01,321 --> 00:43:02,920
Where did you get these letters from

790
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,481
In my mother's boudoir

791
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:09,440
Seems to be waiting for me to find out

792
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,721
No wonder at the banquet

793
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:14,521
Mrs. Zhou and Mrs. Zhou Hou

794
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:15,801
Say what you want to say

795
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,400
They just meant to make you suspicious

796
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,160
I suspect now

797
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,160
The old lady gave the key to Zhou Yue on purpose

798
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:24,801
So what are you going to do

799
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:29,880
Play with one's plan

800
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,481
Half dead all day

801
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,600
Wouldn't it be silly to stay

802
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:10,521
Who

803
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,761
It's all your fault

804
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,561
I'll stew you back and eat cat meat

805
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:18,201
Why are you so vicious

806
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:19,521
To embarrass a cat

807
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
Don't worry

808
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,440
I can't bear to stew it after stewing you

809
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,281
The meat you eat every day

810
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,041
It's all hard to find

811
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,281
What did you say

812
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:32,080
The meat it works so hard to find every day

813
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,521
I am reluctant to eat

814
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,840
Wild goods in the mountains are a big supplement

815
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,160
If you vomit, it will be wasted

816
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:47,360
All right

817
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,920
I'm kidding you

818
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:50,840
You are so bored every day

819
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,561
How unhappy you are without me

820
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:54,521
What's wrong with you

821
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,600
My eyes

822
00:44:58,001 --> 00:44:59,400
When will it get better?

823
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:00,440
Come

824
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,920
Let the magic doctor see it

825
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,640
How is it

826
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,920
Why I still can't see anything

827
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
Say something

828
00:45:29,321 --> 00:45:30,041
May

829
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:32,241
Could be

830
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:34,481
The efficacy has not yet worked

831
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,761
Let's go

832
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:37,761
Where are you going

833
00:45:37,761 --> 00:45:39,640
You'll find out in a minute. Go

834
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,600
Where am I

835
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,440
You listen

836
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,640
The local atmosphere here helps to exert the drug effect

837
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,160
Let you expel toxins

838
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,840
Poor medical skills

839
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,600
There are many patterns

840
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,360
Medical skills are superfluous

841
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,201
Everything has its own destiny

842
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,481
Mutual growth and mutual restraint can cure diseases

843
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,961
My master said it

844
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,761
Is your master a doctor

845
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:26,160
Or someone outside the party

846
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:31,400
Since you're so curious

847
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,721
Then I'm not afraid to tell you

848
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,880
Actually

849
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:38,761
My master is a fairy

850
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,281
I think I can see it

851
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,440
But

852
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,440
It seems that only the shadow can be seen

853
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,600
It's recovering well

854
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,160
When I get back

855
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,600
I'm afraid you'll be fine soon

856
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:13,521
Where are you going

857
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,680
Mid-Autumn Festival will be in a few days

858
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,561
I'm going to the market to buy hairy crabs

859
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,880
What is a hairy crab

860
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,561
No way, little blind man

861
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,561
Haven't you even eaten hairy crabs

862
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,360
I didn't expect you to look decent

863
00:47:31,801 --> 00:47:34,481
I don't even know what hairy crabs are

864
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,880
Don't worry when I come back

865
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,721
We'll have hairy crabs to eat

866
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:42,241
Who wants to eat your hairy crabs

867
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:43,961
You'd better never come back

868
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:47,521
What kind of temper are you

869
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,201
Don't know good or bad
