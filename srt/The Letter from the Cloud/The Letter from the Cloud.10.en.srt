1
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,159
Herbal medicine

2
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,599
With a faint fragrance

3
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,120
That's the smell

4
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,199
This smell

5
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,120
This is specially developed by my father for

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,519
Chestnut powder for repelling snakes and insects

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,919
Only people who care about their families

8
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,800
It was him

9
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,239
You know that guy

10
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,879
My father has a long companion

11
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,000
Named Ji Lu

12
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
He has a mark like this on his neck

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Just like the killer you painted

14
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,680
I looked familiar at that dart before

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,840
Now

16
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
You said he had this rhombic powder on him again

17
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,680
I think

18
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,640
It should be him

19
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,279
The killer

20
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,960
Just like Cai's

21
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,960
They are all the original servants of the family

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,559
A Yue

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
I have to start at once

24
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,840
Go to Cai's mother's hometown

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,959
Why don't you come with us

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,319
You have to go it alone

27
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,679
Gao family

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,399
Is the victim of the Xiao Rong Wang case

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,840
Gao Mo must hate Gu's family

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,319
If he finds Jilu first,

31
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,959
Know my identity

32
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,399
He won't let me go easily

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,759
It's even more impossible for me to stay in the punishments department any longer

34
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,079
So I must find Jilu first

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,160
A Yue

36
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,399
You help me stall Gao Mo first

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,840
I stalled him

38
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,520
How can I hold him off

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,719
You can do it

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,840
Spring Inn

41
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,799
Assassin's mark

42
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,280
No signature

43
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,759
Who would have left it

44
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,519
A Yue

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,679
Why don't you knock at the door

46
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,399
You didn't lock the door either

47
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,599
Why knock on the door again

48
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,000
We used to be classmates

49
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,200
Still living together

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,159
Keep a distance

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,879
I'm really looking for you on business

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,399
Someone put this in my room

53
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,120
If someone really wants to give us a clue,

54
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,159
Why didn't you tell me directly

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,759
Will it

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,959
Someone knows that we are looking into the murderer

57
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,519
Deliberately set an ambush for us

58
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,039
This matter is dangerous

59
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,039
Maybe the other person doesn't want to show up

60
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:42,879
But no matter what

61
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,200
As long as there is a clue

62
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,239
We have to check it out

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,759
But

64
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,720
Don't be buzz

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,959
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

66
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,759
Whether there is Gan Kun inside or not

67
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,640
I didn't know until I went

68
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,280
Go

69
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,599
Where's your lady

70
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:00,920
A fish

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
A Yu said he had just arrived here

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,280
Want to go out for a walk

73
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,360
Then let's go first

74
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,280
But in case

75
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,879
What if she can't find us when she comes back

76
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,080
She is so clever that she can definitely find it

77
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,440
Go for a walk

78
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,239
Haven't seen it

79
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,599
The guest who lives in your shop

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560
Have you ever seen them

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,360
Your Excellency

82
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,200
We're not a black shop either

83
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,959
Don't go through the guests' baggage

84
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,239
Where shall I meet you

85
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,000
There are many guests coming and going every day

86
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,480
I can't remember the small ones

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,599
Of the guests who have stayed in your shop,

88
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,599
Do you remember

89
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,440
Is there a mark of this shape

90
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,639
Don't say it

91
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:05,760
There really is

92
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,440
What kind of person is it

93
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,600
When have you been here

94
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,880
Right there

95
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,399
The nights of the first two days

96
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,160
The guest officer came to stay in the hotel

97
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,560
He was dressed in black

98
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,760
There is such a mark on the neck

99
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,239
As if

100
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,079
He also suffered a shoulder injury

101
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,600
I still live in our upper room here

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,720
Unexpectedly

103
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,720
He ran away in the middle of the night

104
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,280
I didn't even pay for the room

105
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,040
It seems that he has really been here

106
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,359
Your Excellency

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
If we catch him,

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,399
You have to help the villain

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,000
Get back the room rate

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,359
But even if I came here,

111
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,760
Liangxian County is so big

112
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,160
It's not easy to find someone

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
We can put up notices

114
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,359
Mobilize the people

115
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,840
Find someone in a high profile

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,239
Get out of the way, get out of the way

117
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,799
Put up a notice

118
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,519
Take a look

119
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,040
A heavy reward

120
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,679
If someone knows this crescent moon mark,

121
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,160
Or have seen this kind of hidden weapons

122
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,000
Reward a hundred taels of gold

123
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,919
A hundred taels of gold

124
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,479
If this really provides a clue,

125
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,560
Don't worry all your life

126
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,919
Be rich

127
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:17,880
A hundred taels of gold

128
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,040
Row

129
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,239
Thank you, boss

130
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,320
Big Brother

131
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
Please go to Zhaojia Village once

132
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
How much silver do you want

133
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Go to Zhao Village

134
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:35,919
Not expensive

135
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,959
Fifty essays

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,199
I just finished inquiring

137
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,840
The line price is twenty pence

138
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,280
You ask me for fifty

139
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,639
Really when I begged for nothing before

140
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Fifty essays

141
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,399
Isn't it too cheap

142
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,799
Is it cheap

143
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,639
Right, right, right

144
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,239
My asking price has always been very reasonable

145
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,840
Not Big Brother

146
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,639
I heard that you are going to Zhaojia Village here

147
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,720
You have to pay the city gate guards for the transportation

148
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,199
Fifty pencils pull me over

149
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
You don't lose money

150
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,280
Be alive

151
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,519
Not a little

152
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,519
Pursuit other than money, isn't it

153
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,199
There is nothing wrong with me

154
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,239
Is willing to give

155
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,959
Official Master

156
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,000
This big brother took me to Zhaojiacun

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,399
If you want me to say fifty cents, you want me to say it

158
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,639
Don't ask for the transportation fee

159
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,679
Otherwise, he will lose too much

160
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,239
Fifty essays

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Zhao San

162
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,840
I thought you said you went to Zhaojiacun

163
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you earn only ten pence

164
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,359
That's why we charge you two pence for traveling and traveling

165
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,040
What the hell is going on

166
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,000
It's ten texts and five brothers

167
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,120
This girl she misheard

168
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Hear wrong

169
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,519
Ten essays

170
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,639
Isn't it fifty fens

171
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,720
You must have misheard

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
I told you it was ten

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,880
Are you sure it's ten

174
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,639
Ten texts ten texts

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,720
Sounds great

176
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,560
You are very reasonable

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,639
Be benevolent and benevolent

178
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,320
Let's start quickly before it's too late, shall we

179
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
Let's go. Let's go

180
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,760
You do your job first. We'll go first

181
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,519
Thank you very much

182
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,799
Sit down.

183
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,799
All right, let's go

184
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:08,919
Big Brother

185
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,160
Do you know a man named

186
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't know, don't know

187
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,320
I didn't even say who it was

188
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Why did you say you didn't know each other

189
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,679
I don't know who you say it is

190
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,280
This money saves you

191
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,160
Brother, please stop for a moment

192
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:40,919
Qi Zhang

193
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,079
I thought you left me alone

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,440
Brother

195
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,399
I want to take a ride to Zhao Jiacun

196
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,280
I wonder if it's convenient

197
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,280
Convenient and convenient

198
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,239
Childe, where do you want to sit

199
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
Why don't you sit where you feel comfortable

200
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,840
I'll just ride on the board

201
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
If you think she's in the way,

202
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,120
I'll just blow her down

203
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,160
Why don't you go down

204
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,239
Why are you blasting me

205
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,359
I paid for it

206
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,679
Just your little money

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,079
I'll give it back to you in a big deal

208
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Is fifty articles enough

209
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
You are really a person

210
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,840
No harm

211
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,599
I can sit with this girl

212
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,000
Think of it as a person

213
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:17,919
Movable ornaments

214
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,200
You are an open-minded person when you see your son

215
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,320
It's different from haggling over every ounce

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,719
Come childe, I'll lay the cushion for you

217
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,760
Please wait a moment

218
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,520
And there are cushions

219
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,599
You have a cushion. Why didn't you lay it for me just now

220
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,400
What kind of cushion do you want

221
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,400
Two layers of soft and come

222
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,440
Come, childe, come and sit down. Come on

223
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
This brother

224
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,719
Are you playing with this official

225
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,520
What I want is hidden weapons

226
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,120
Are you a hidden weapon

227
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,640
You're the murder weapon

228
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
If you can't, you can't

229
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
What are you yelling about

230
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
I'll just take it

231
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,239
Take it away at once

232
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,159
Next

233
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,599
I don't know this big brother

234
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,960
Can there be a clue

235
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,279
Two days ago in Wuming Mountain Cave

236
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,679
Little man has seen a man

237
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,400
The man has a shoulder injury

238
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,200
He dropped a hidden weapon

239
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,719
It is this maple leaf shape

240
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
I wanted to play more firewood today

241
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,080
I didn't expect to meet such a ghost weather

242
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,679
Excuse me, brother

243
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,839
Wuming Mountain

244
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,760
Brother

245
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
You are quite familiar with this neighborhood

246
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,479
I want to ask you about someone

247
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,279
Familiar with

248
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,159
Childe

249
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,239
If you have any questions, just ask

250
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,520
My family lives in Zhaojia Village

251
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,039
That's a coincidence

252
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,799
I'm here to visit relatives

253
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,440
My aunt Chua lives in your village

254
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:14,640
Childe

255
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,479
The Cai family

256
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,000
Then you came here for nothing today

257
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,279
Why

258
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,760
What is the reason

259
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,320
The Cai family

260
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,599
It was in this village

261
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,799
People who have lived for several lifetimes

262
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,400
But in recent years,

263
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,880
All the Ju clans have moved

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,359
No one was left behind

265
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,039
Relocation of Ju clan

266
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,640
Is something happening

267
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,799
Yes

268
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,599
A great good thing

269
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,359
There are people in the Cai family who have made a lot of money in the south

270
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,640
I heard that I got married with local merchants

271
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,799
Fear that people are thin and bullied

272
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,640
I paid for it

273
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,679
Let the Ju clan follow him to the south to develop

274
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,080
Do you know Chua's new address in the south

275
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
I don't know this

276
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,359
No one in our village knows

277
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,640
Then the Cai family is developed

278
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,359
I have no contact with the villagers anymore

279
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,799
Your aunt is

280
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,200
Cai Jiu Niang

281
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
Cai Jiuniang, I know

282
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,039
Her husband died in her early years

283
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,919
The baby has not been raised either

284
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,159
Hard luck

285
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,039
Childe, I'm telling you

286
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,200
You don't mind saying something

287
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,359
Her husband

288
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,000
There is a mark on the neck

289
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,719
The villagers all said it

290
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,719
This kind of person is in the previous life

291
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,960
Come with resentment

292
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,919
So, Cai Jiuniang

293
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,239
I was widowed early

294
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,599
And his son died

295
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,719
Have a mark on the neck

296
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,640
What kind of

297
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,359
Meniscus-shaped

298
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,760
When he came to the village to meet his wedding,

299
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,679
I've seen it before

300
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,359
It's a pity that the man didn't get there early

301
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,760
Cai Jiuniang went to a large family to be a nurse

302
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,880
It turns out that these two people are not in

303
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,159
Gu Jiacai hooked up

304
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,599
It turned out to be a married couple

305
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,839
It was the assassination of Ayue before

306
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,120
And run away. The assassin

307
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,279
Brother

308
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,919
Chua's husband is also my uncle

309
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,359
Do you know where he's buried

310
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,880
I want to go to worship

311
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,400
It's not for nothing to come here

312
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,159
This one

313
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,279
I really don't know

314
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,120
The poor in our village

315
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,679
They are buried in Langshan when they die

316
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,560
From here

317
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,960
It's dozens of miles

318
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,560
Mother Cai and Ji Lu are husband and wife

319
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,679
Why did Jilu pretend to die in advance

320
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,080
Is it true that before entering our family,

321
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,479
They're already laying out

322
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,400
You can't believe everything Zhao San said

323
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Now that I'm here,

324
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,239
Let's find out for ourselves

325
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,039
More secure

326
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:33,880
Probe in person

327
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,159
You mean

328
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,320
We're going to dig graves

329
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,080
I'm going

330
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,159
You for a while

331
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:39,919
Find a family

332
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,159
Spend a good night

333
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,080
We have news

334
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,520
I'll come back and talk to you

335
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,760
According to the woodcutter

336
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,000
This should be it

337
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,239
You see

338
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,880
There are people who live too much here

339
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,599
He must have been here

340
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,679
Seems

341
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,880
After Ji Lu was injured, he originally voted for the inn

342
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
But I feel wrong

343
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,159
So he fled to this mountain

344
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,200
Was bumped into by the woodcutter

345
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,560
It seems that we have narrowed it down again this time

346
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,760
Just check around here

347
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,760
I'm sure we can find out where he is

348
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:27,839
Be careful

349
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:38,919
A Yue

350
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:39,880
How is it

351
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,919
I

352
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm okay

353
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,000
This snake is poisonous

354
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,279
What are you doing

355
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,039
I'll clean up the toxins for you

356
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,039
Otherwise, the poison will enter the bone marrow

357
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,640
Your life is at stake

358
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,159
No need

359
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,960
You take me back to Liang County now

360
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,719
Go to the doctor

361
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,080
It's more than ten miles from Liangxian County

362
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,400
When I go back and find the doctor

363
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,320
Your life is over

364
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,520
Then you don't have to help me

365
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,960
Violation of etiquette

366
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,479
You and I are both men. What etiquette do you say

367
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,279
That's not allowed either

368
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,080
High ink

369
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,039
If you dare

370
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,839
I will go back to Liangxian County now

371
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:23,440
A Yue

372
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,479
Urgent subordination

373
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,279
I have to save you

374
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,239
No matter

375
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,080
It is important to save people

376
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,760
I thought I told you to stay in the village

377
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,279
Why are you following me

378
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,120
I also want to visit the grave

379
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
I want to see what they're up to

380
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,640
The graveyard. Is that a fun place

381
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,159
What if the killer lies in ambush there

382
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,039
Go back quickly

383
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:45,960
I'm not going back

384
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,439
I'm the owner

385
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,239
Go back quickly

386
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,040
From now on

387
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,920
I'm your employer now

388
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,520
I'll hire you for this trip

389
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,079
Over there

390
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,680
I said you were too stingy

391
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
Just one

392
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,359
Shen fish

393
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,760
If you're afraid

394
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,920
Just hide behind me

395
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,280
What's there to be afraid of

396
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:45,959
Your Highness

397
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,800
Have you ever seen a coffin opened

398
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,959
Let you see something new today

399
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,120
What for

400
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:53,920
Stop it

401
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,559
What if there is a mechanism in this coffin

402
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,400
Hide well

403
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,400
You're a layman

404
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,920
In such a shabby coffin,

405
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,280
How can you have money to install an organ

406
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,479
Just pry it open

407
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,400
Then you have to drive

408
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I'll drive, too

409
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,719
There are still treasures here

410
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,719
Don't move

411
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:56,680
Be careful

412
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,680
Stay awake in the middle of the night

413
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,559
Run to the graveyard to ambush

414
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,800
I'd like to see whose slave you are

415
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,760
Work so hard

416
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,359
It was you

417
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:43,079
Your Highness

418
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,359
Take off his clothes for me

419
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,359
Picking up clothes

420
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
Extreme measures in extraordinary times

421
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,000
What do you want to do

422
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,120
Wait

423
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,359
Girl

424
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,479
Shall we have something to talk to

425
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,439
You

426
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,680
King Ben undresses you

427
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Are you content

428
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,400
Not you

429
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,800
Is this all right

430
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,520
Is this good

431
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,760
Let me see

432
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,400
This is a filiform needle

433
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,520
This is a plum blossom needle

434
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
This is a triangular needle

435
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,599
Your life is really good

436
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,920
I'll let you taste it all today

437
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,559
We have something to say, don't we

438
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,079
If you want to ask me anything, you can ask me directly. It must be

439
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:35,800
You can't just do this

440
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,520
Make your mouth shut

441
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,000
Make your mouth shut

442
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,000
Make your mouth shut

443
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,880
Make your mouth shut

444
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,160
Why don't you ask

445
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,120
You ask. The point is

446
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,920
How do you know I don't want to tell if you don't ask

447
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,319
That's right, too

448
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,280
And this step

449
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,000
I forgot

450
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,680
Then you go ahead

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,040
Why assassinate us

452
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,920
Take people's money

453
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,359
Eliminate disasters for others

454
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,839
Take whose money

455
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,839
Eliminate what disaster

456
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,800
Don't say it yet

457
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,000
Is your needle poisonous

458
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,719
Have you ever heard of the seven-needle heartbreak method

459
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,839
Every time I give a shot,

460
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,959
Your intestines will mess up

461
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,719
Then tie the knot again

462
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,719
And then it gets tighter and tighter

463
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,559
Until life is cut off from each other

464
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,719
And then you die suddenly

465
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:39,559
Gu Yi

466
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,280
You are so vicious. You

467
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:53,880
Ji Lu

468
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:56,199
Compared with your murder of Gujia Manmen,

469
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,359
My viciousness

470
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,599
It's not one ten thousandth of yours, is it

471
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,079
I'm not going to tell you everything yet, am I

472
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,160
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

473
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,400
You step back

474
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,680
I said

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,040
Chua and I

476
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,280
It was originally a husband and wife

477
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,839
In the early years, before Xiaorong Wang's murder,

478
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,199
We were bought

479
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,559
Replace the prescription prescribed by Dr. Gu to Gao Guifei

480
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,719
Afterwards, we will be arranged to leave the family early

481
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,559
Can dodge a bullet

482
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,520
But what I didn't expect was that

483
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,719
You suddenly appear again

484
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,239
So they want to use my wife Chua as bait

485
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,319
Lead you in

486
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,199
I'll kill Chua again

487
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,559
Frame you, that's all

488
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,920
And what else

489
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,719
And you escaped

490
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,160
They sent me to continue after you

491
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,079
No, that's all

492
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,239
Who is the person who instigates you

493
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,719
Now the hospital envoy of Taiyuan Hospital

494
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,000
He Guang

495
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
It was him

496
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,400
Where are the prescriptions

497
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,040
In the mezzanine of that box

498
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,800
This girl

499
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
The snake venom in is not too deep

500
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:03,239
Take the medicine according to my prescription for two days

501
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,040
You can return to normal

502
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,520
This is yours

503
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,040
I also prescribed medicine for you

504
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,199
I have been practicing medicine for many years

505
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:15,079
I've never seen anyone dare to suck snake venom with his mouth

506
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,920
Are you saying

507
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,559
She is a woman

508
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,199
I have been practicing medicine for many years

509
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:29,040
Is this a man or a woman? Can you still make a mistake

510
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,559
Thank you, Doctor

511
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,079
Thank you very much

512
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,280
You walk slowly

513
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,000
If you dare

514
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,239
I will go back to Liangxian County now

515
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,079
You and I don't care about this

516
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,319
I came right away with no clothes on

517
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:10,760
Backward

518
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,920
I didn't expect you to work with me in the punishments department

519
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,040
That's wonderful

520
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,000
We can be together again

521
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,839
Keep a distance

522
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,040
You either don't go

523
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,199
Or take me with you

524
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:23,959
Let go

525
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,640
I don't

526
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Keep a distance

527
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:00,959
Ayue Ayue

528
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:04,520
A Yue

529
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,760
Mr. Wang told us to strengthen our bodies

530
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Do you think I am quite magnificent

531
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,520
Come and show me yours

532
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,959
Keep a distance

533
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,959
No wonder all these years

534
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,800
Keep telling me to keep my distance

535
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,000
Go

536
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,640
Zhou Yue, let's take a bath in the river

537
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,520
I'm not going

538
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,439
Let's go

539
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,599
Don't wriggle like a girl

540
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,479
I'm not going

541
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,599
Walk to take a bath

542
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,559
We'll help you undress

543
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,559
I'm not going I'm not going

544
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,319
What have I done

545
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,520
I have known you for many years

546
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,079
I didn't even notice it at all

547
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,719
You are a daughter

548
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,400
I really don't know what to do with you

549
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,599
You just

550
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,719
Is there nothing you want to ask me

551
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:15,239
You'll tell me if you want to

552
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:20,439
Your Highness is wise and wise, and can see the world

553
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:21,640
Even if I don't say it

554
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,959
You've already seen through everything, haven't you

555
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:25,839
I'm waiting for you to tell me

556
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,439
Will you believe anything I say

557
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,000
As long as you say it

558
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,839
I believe it all

559
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,800
Then I won't hide it from you anymore

560
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,160
I am Gu Yi, the first daughter of the family

561
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,000
All this I've done

562
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,760
It's all to clear the grievances of the family

563
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,160
Carrying so much

564
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,760
Must be very tired

565
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,920
Compared with the relatives who died unjustly,

566
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,040
What am I going through all this

567
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,760
How did you get here all these years

568
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,040
After the family lost,

569
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,520
I escaped from the distribution road

570
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,479
Mixed market

571
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,439
Like a beggar

572
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,439
No one knows that I used to be a darling daughter

573
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,520
I have long forgotten my identity

574
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,680
All I can think of every day

575
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,479
Is how to fill your stomach

576
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,599
I want to let myself live

577
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,640
Only to live

578
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,599
In order to reverse the case for the family

579
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,319
Revenge one's loved ones

580
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,719
Shen fish

581
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,280
Henceforth

582
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,000
You have one more for me

583
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,239
Are you willing to help me

584
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,120
Why

585
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,400
This king is a courtier of the emperor

586
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,000
Now I have learned that my family has grievances

587
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,880
Helping you reverse your conviction can be regarded as sharing worries for the emperor

588
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,359
The Way of Being a Minister

589
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,880
Sing a high profile

590
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,280
This king is going to be for you and the dignitaries in Beijing

591
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,319
Mediate to commit risks

592
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,000
You said Ben Wang sings high-profile

593
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,319
All right, all right

594
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,559
His Royal Highness King Jing is very kind

595
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,000
The little girl wrote it down

596
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,199
If there is a need in the future,

597
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,920
The little girl must go through fire and water

598
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,439
Who told you to smear your liver and brain

599
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,920
As long as you don't worry this king in the future

600
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,719
Worried about the task given to you by this king

601
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:55,479
The king will be satisfied

602
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You can rest assured of this

603
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,479
As long as

604
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,680
I can bring Jilu back to Beijing this time

605
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,239
Submit it to the Criminal Department for examination

606
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,040
I will serve your highness wholeheartedly

607
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,040
Never be lazy again

608
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,040
Wholeheartedly

609
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,520
How dare you

610
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,680
You went to intercept and kill Qi Zhang without permission

611
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,599
And let him get away

612
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,880
This inverse

613
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:31,920
Inverse

614
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,959
Father father

615
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:33,400
Inverse

616
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,920
I didn't think there was a mistake either

617
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:36,760
Father

618
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,959
Spy reward

619
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,920
Qi Zhang has arrested Ji Lu

620
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,000
What

621
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,959
Stupid

622
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,800
It's foolish

623
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,520
Sickle

624
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,680
You send someone quickly

625
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,800
To intercept and kill them

626
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,719
Never let Qi Zhang bring Ji Lu back to Beijing

627
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,160
Yes

628
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:06,959
You give it to me, too

629
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,559
Fuck off

630
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:10,880
Fuck off

631
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,599
I know my father

632
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,160
Fuck off

633
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,479
Go where

634
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,120
Dispelling gas, dispelling gas

635
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,319
This man

636
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,479
What would you like to eat

637
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:30,959
Rice congee

638
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:31,880
Fried eggs

639
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,880
All right

640
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,040
Wait

641
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,559
I bought it for patients

642
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,719
Can you eat it

643
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,880
Patients can eat, of course they can eat

644
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:43,120
Wait a little longer

645
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,160
Can female patients eat it

646
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,839
I get it

647
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:57,479
Uncle

648
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,959
Would you wait a moment

649
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,479
Grandpa, take it well

650
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,400
OK, thank you, sir

651
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,439
You walk slowly

652
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,040
Fragrant bar

653
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,120
This smells good

654
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,239
You can try

655
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,800
You try it

656
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,719
I'll try

657
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,000
Look how delicate and fragrant it is

658
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Isn't it

659
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,439
It's better than the one just now

660
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,680
Right

661
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,760
Watch first

662
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,040
Childe

663
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Buy rouge

664
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:36,520
Here I am

665
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,199
But the most popular make-up products in Beijing

666
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,920
Make sure your wife is satisfied with buying it back

667
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,359
Madam

668
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,479
Not yet

669
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,000
Look at your shy energy, childe

670
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,120
That's not a matter of sooner or later when raw rice is cooked

671
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,720
How to choose this rouge

672
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,559
Are you going to buy

673
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,240
Makeup powder

674
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,920
Fine powder or forehead yellow lip grease and face grease

675
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,999
Does it make a difference

676
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,480
Of course

677
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:09,400
You're gonna tell me

678
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,160
The girl you like

679
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,559
What she looks like

680
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,480
How do you dress at ordinary times

681
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:18,519
Usual words

682
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,400
Most of them are golden crowns

683
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:24,999
Dark brocade or plain robe

684
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,880
Occasionally, I wear official clothes

685
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:28,799
Official uniform

686
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:31,440
Man

687
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,720
No

688
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,839
She she

689
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,039
Understand, understand

690
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,240
I get it

691
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:42,599
This box

692
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,960
This is the treasure of my shop

693
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,839
It's unisex

694
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,640
Make sure the one you like

695
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,799
Your Excellency

696
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:54,120
Will like it, too

697
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,039
Who gave me the medicine

698
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,480
This snake is poisonous

699
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,839
What are you doing

700
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,279
I'll clean up the toxins for you

701
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,680
Otherwise, the poison will enter the bone marrow

702
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,240
Your life is at stake

703
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,640
No need

704
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,519
You take me back to Liang County now

705
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,319
Go to the doctor

706
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,519
It is more than ten miles away from Liangxian County

707
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,519
When you go back and find the doctor, your life is over

708
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,999
Then you don't have to help me

709
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,440
Violation of etiquette

710
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,960
You and I are both men. What etiquette do you say

711
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:48,799
That's not allowed either

712
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,319
The corset is still there

713
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:53,559
But my wound

714
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:57,400
A Yue

715
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,359
I brought you breakfast

716
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,319
Look at him looking so unnatural

717
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,559
You can't find out, can you

718
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,079
Are you, are you getting better

719
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,160
Much better

720
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,799
Yesterday

721
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,960
But you brought me back

722
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,240
No, no, no, no, hug

723
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,799
I-I didn't hug

724
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,680
I'm back to back

725
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,839
Back

726
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,640
A Yue

727
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,440
You, you have porridge

728
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,799
When you are ready, we will set off for Langshan

729
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:42,999
What are you doing in Langshan

730
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,999
You were sick last night and I didn't tell you

731
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,799
Someone provided a clue

732
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,999
Said he knew a man from Zhaojiacun

733
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,880
The man's name is Ji Lu

734
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,839
There is one around the neck

735
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,319
Meniscus-shaped imprint

736
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,680
Ji Lu

737
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:01,920
Seems

738
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,279
He has found out

739
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,759
One more thing

740
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,559
You'll never think of it

741
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,400
This auspicious road, he is the Xianggong of Cai's family

742
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,720
Said he died of illness a few years ago

743
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,519
Buried in Langshan

744
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,720
Cai's Xianggong

745
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,279
He and Cai Jiuniang are husband and wife

746
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,400
For me, too

747
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,120
I was surprised, too

748
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,880
If we say

749
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,240
The man who assassinated us

750
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:27,440
If it's Ji Lu

751
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,519
Then why did you pretend to die in the first place

752
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:33,759
Why come back suddenly now

753
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,920
This matter

754
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:37,960
Does it have anything to do with the family

755
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:40,559
Does it have anything to do with Xiao Rong Wang

756
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,039
I have to find out

757
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,880
I don't know how it's going over there

758
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,480
Have you found Jilu

759
00:39:58,759 --> 00:39:59,160
That's right

760
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:00,680
Where's the fish

761
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,920
Are you back yet

762
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,440
Let's wait for her to come back and go together

763
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,359
Leave her here alone

764
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:08,680
I'm not at ease

765
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,839
Good

766
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:14,839
Have porridge first

767
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,920
What's the matter

768
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,079
This one doesn't sell well

769
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,640
I'll get a change

770
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,359
No harm

771
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,999
Let's change it

772
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,720
What the hell is going on? Put it down

773
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:36,640
Characteristic

774
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,400
Everyone has it

775
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,720
Everyone has it

776
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:45,960
It's all the same

777
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,079
Father

778
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:52,960
Sent a spy to report it

779
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,519
Said someone saw Qi Zhang and Shen Shi

780
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,759
Appear near Liangxian County with Jilu

781
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,039
What do we do next

782
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,480
What else can I do

783
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,960
If you ask me, find a group of top killers

784
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,440
Kill them and leave nothing behind

785
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,440
Shut up

786
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,920
How many time have I told you

787
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,720
Less than a last resort

788
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,120
Don't do it easily

789
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,759
Use your brain

790
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
You can't remember

791
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,720
Still don't understand

792
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,160
Then what else can I do

793
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,200
Sickle

794
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,400
What do you think

795
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,720
Although Ji Lu was caught by Qi Zhang,

796
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,999
But he is a captaincy

797
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,120
I have no right to interfere in criminal cases

798
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,319
As long as someone sued Jilu for committing crimes again,

799
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,279
The punishments department ordered the arrest

800
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:43,799
No matter how hard he is,

801
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,400
I dare not compete with the law

802
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,999
Once the punishments department gets Jilu,

803
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Then kill and cut

804
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,839
It's not your father yet. You have the final say

805
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,519
Easy to say

806
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,839
Jilu has been arrested

807
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,480
How can a case be committed

808
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:57,519
Is it difficult

809
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,359
Let's make up a case now

810
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,519
Make up one now

811
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,039
Give it to me

812
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,920
No need

813
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:18,400
Are you still afraid of him running

814
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,079
Don't worry

815
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,880
I sealed his hands and feet

816
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,160
I can't make any splash

817
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:28,160
This trip is not for nothing

818
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,480
Caught Jilu

819
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,720
I'll be cleared of murderers

820
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,400
After returning to Beijing

821
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,880
What are you going to do

822
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:36,839
Hand him over to the punishments department for interrogation at once

823
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,279
As long as he confesses in court

824
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:39,920
The matter of changing the prescription in that year

825
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,359
Under the eyes of the public

826
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,279
The punishments department has to try if it doesn't want to

827
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,839
He Guang is behind the family case

828
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,599
And He Guang is Ning Wang Yimai

829
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,039
I'm afraid it's not that easy

830
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,240
Unexpectedly

831
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,120
My family's grievance can finally be cleared up

832
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,839
Heaven has eyes

833
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,120
Speaking of it

834
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,039
I have to thank your highness for this matter

835
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,120
The little girl has nothing to report

836
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,640
Not as good as

837
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:08,400
You

838
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,039
What are you doing

839
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,480
Pay attention to discretion

840
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:14,640
Pay attention to what discretion

841
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,240
I mean, after returning to Beijing,

842
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,559
Please go down to Changtai Building to eat and listen to music

843
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,559
Where does your highness want to go

844
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
That's what Ben Wang thinks

845
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,759
Then why are you so nervous

846
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:29,759
My ears are still red

847
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,759
Whose ears are red

848
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,999
A bunch of nonsense

849
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,559
Why are you so excited

850
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:35,599
I haven't finished yet

851
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,960
This little money fan

852
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Said to go to the market

853
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:04,559
Haven't come back yet

854
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,120
Your Highness, don't panic. It's us

855
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,319
You are

856
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,240
General Zhao

857
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,039
At the end of the meeting, Zhao Hongxiu saw your highness

858
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:18,680
If it were you

859
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:20,559
We've been looking for your highness

860
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,799
I found it

861
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:24,359
Your Highness

862
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:25,680
Your eyes

863
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:26,960
There is no serious problem

864
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
You will recover in a few days

865
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,720
Your Highness

866
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:32,519
Yongzhou can't be without a owner for a day

867
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:33,400
I implore your highness

868
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,440
Come back with us at once

869
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,599
Sit in Yongzhou

870
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,359
Parents were killed one after another

871
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,359
As a son of man, can I sit idly by

872
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,200
I can't go back

873
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,799
But you are the Lord of Yongzhou

874
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,120
What happened to King Jing

875
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,319
Now the border is also ready to move

876
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,079
The officials of Yongzhou are waiting for you

877
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,359
Tens of thousands of people are waiting for you

878
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,799
This is your duty

879
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,319
It's not too late

880
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,120
Please leave at once

881
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,160
Your Highness

882
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,279
When I return to Yongzhou,

883
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,240
Take a long-term view of everything

884
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:06,960
These days

885
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,880
Thanks to the rescue of one person

886
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,680
To be able to live

887
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,839
He healed my eyes, too

888
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:15,039
That might as well

889
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,480
Take him back with you

890
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,120
Wait until you return to Yongzhou to thank you well

891
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,240
The future is uncertain

892
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,720
It is useless to let him take risks with us

893
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:29,359
General Zhao

894
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,519
Just a moment

895
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,279
Your Highness

896
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,920
Are you here

897
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,440
I just wanted to tell him

898
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:54,960
My eyes have healed

899
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,480
Don't worry about me anymore

900
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,960
Don't say goodbye

901
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,759
Will meet each other eventually
