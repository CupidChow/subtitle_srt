1
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
Endurance

2
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,161
Look forward to joy

3
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,600
Hard to persist

4
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,560
You must get something

5
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:39,760
Dad

6
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,481
You taught me from an early age

7
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,880
Just stick to it

8
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,360
Adversity will always be reborn

9
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,640
But now

10
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,601
What else can I do

11
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,720
I can't guess all the time

12
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,440
Why did Jilu suddenly turn against the water

13
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,400
There must be something wrong with this

14
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:12,360
Jilu knew King Ning was going to kill him

15
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Even if the confession is retracted

16
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,521
King Ning won't keep him in the future

17
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,801
That could threaten him

18
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:20,000
What else is there

19
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,680
Jilu is now locked up in the punishments department like me

20
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,640
Presumably Qi Zhang and Ayue

21
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:29,040
I'm sure I'll find a way to ask him the truth

22
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,680
I can't go on decadent

23
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,640
I have to pull myself together

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,881
Ji Lu

25
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,921
Ji Lu

26
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,040
What happened to Jilu

27
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,081
What are you shouting? You've never seen the dead before

28
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,281
Go

29
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,441
Hurry to the mass grave

30
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,760
Dead

31
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:05,320
Jilu, you can't die

32
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,320
My family hasn't reversed my verdict yet

33
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,441
Ji Lu

34
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,040
My family hasn't reversed my verdict yet

35
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:11,561
You can't die

36
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,361
Why did Ji Lu suddenly commit suicide

37
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:15,841
It is not clear yet

38
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,001
I guess he retracted his confession

39
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,641
If you reach some kind of agreement with people,

40
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,641
Then suicide should be part of the agreement

41
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:24,721
Qi Mao

42
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:26,441
What are you doing

43
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:30,160
Recently, the places in Beijing are restless

44
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:32,481
The remnants of the family went to Beijing against the decree

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
He also involved His Royal Highness King Jing

46
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:37,721
The emperor is worried about the safety of His Royal Highness King Jing

47
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,680
I am hereby sent to protect

48
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,880
You're protecting

49
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,400
Or house arrest

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,240
What you think is your business

51
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,520
I am here by decree

52
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,240
No one in Jingwangfu is allowed to go out

53
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,680
What if the king insists on going out

54
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,361
Yamamura Nobuo

55
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,880
This prince is eager for you to disobey your orders and not respect them

56
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,680
When the time comes, I'll do it first

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
Destroy your King House

58
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,040
To vent the hatred in my heart

59
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,880
How King Jing

60
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,520
I can't get out of the house yet

61
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,960
So it seems

62
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,160
Beijing is really restless recently

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,960
Ben Wang Ping Ri

64
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,320
It's not safe to guard the door with wolfhounds

65
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,240
There is a prince today

66
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,760
This king is a lot of peace of mind

67
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Qi Zhang, dare you scold me

68
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Yongzhou takes you as its king

69
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,880
In this capital city

70
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,201
I'll show you

71
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:33,641
Who is the boss

72
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,281
Bearer

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,121
King Jing has a good relationship with Shen Shi, a criminal woman

74
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,240
Repeated shielding

75
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,081
I suspect Shen Shi has an accomplice

76
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,201
Hide in Jingwangfu

77
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,680
Go inside and search for me

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,721
This is Jingwangfu

79
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:45,760
Without the will of the emperor

80
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,641
Who dares to move

81
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,921
I moved

82
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,400
What can you do to me

83
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Qi Mao

84
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,880
This Wang Nian is in the same ancestry for you and me

85
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,641
You take people out of Jingwangfu immediately

86
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,081
This king can not pursue

87
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:01,960
Jokes

88
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,841
My father is Prince Ning

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,761
There are many high-ranking students

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,360
You are a little captaincy

91
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,200
You think I'm afraid of you

92
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:11,321
Search for me

93
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,121
Bearer

94
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:20,200
Hello, Qi Zhang

95
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,480
Stationing troops privately in the government

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,761
You are openly rebelling

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,640
I guard the border in Yongzhou

98
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,881
Yongzhou men practice day by day

99
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,441
These are just chores in the government

100
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,041
However, if there is a demand,

101
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,321
They can also go into battle to kill the enemy

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,360
I don't believe you dare move

103
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,960
I am the son of Prince Ning

104
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,441
Qi Zhang

105
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:43,841
What do you want to do

106
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,761
Everyone listens to orders

107
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
Those who trespass on the palace will be killed

108
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:49,881
Stop

109
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:57,041
Zhou Yue

110
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,240
Meet your highness

111
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:01,761
Meet Shizi

112
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:05,920
Why are you two so at loggerheads

113
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Zhou Yue

114
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
What are you doing here

115
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,240
Because of the Shen Shi case

116
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,680
Involving His Royal Highness King Jing

117
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,480
I have come to invite your highness to the punishments department

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,920
Understand some facts

119
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,680
The emperor has a life

120
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,001
Grounded Qi Zhang in Jingwangfu

121
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,360
No one is allowed to enter or leave

122
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,721
That officer came unfortunate

123
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,240
But

124
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,841
His Royal Highness King Jing can't leave the house

125
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,161
I can stay in the mansion

126
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,561
Record your highness's testimony

127
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,121
Then bring the documents back to the punishments department

128
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,281
It's the same

129
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
I'm afraid Lord Zhou can't do what you want

130
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,841
Some people say that the king harbored criminals in the mansion

131
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,281
Going into the house to search

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,601
That's it

133
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,960
According to the statute of the great enlightenment

134
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,400
All searches of royal clansmen

135
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,121
The emperor must issue an imperial edict to the punishments department

136
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,360
Then the punishments department will take people to check it

137
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,601
As far as I know,

138
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,640
Today, the punishments department has not received such an imperial edict

139
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,561
If you dare to come out, you can have an imperial edict

140
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,041
I-I got the emperor's message

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,841
The prince forgives his sins

142
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,640
National laws are in accordance with

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,881
Trespassing on Jingwangfu without imperial edict

144
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:21,800
If this matter reaches the ears of the emperor,

145
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,121
I'm afraid it's not easy to explain

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,601
Zhou Yue

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,001
How dare you go against me

148
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,360
I would rather have the palace

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,321
King Ning is a minister of humeral arms

150
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,121
You should lead by example

151
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,680
No bending the law

152
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,240
Please think twice

153
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,281
It is well known that the prince and King Jing are at odds

154
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,240
Even if the sovereign has the heart to protect, he is afraid of falling into reality

155
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,640
At that time

156
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,761
It will not only shake the emperor's trust in the prince

157
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,161
It will also hurt the prince

158
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,960
A reputation accumulated over the years

159
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,080
Temporary Qi and the Future of Ning Wangfu

160
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,841
Which is lighter or heavier

161
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:00,480
Presumably, the prince knows fairly well

162
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,601
Please allow me

163
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,121
Ask your highness a few questions

164
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:08,400
Good

165
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,001
Time to give you a cup of tea

166
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,441
Go

167
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,321
Lord Zhou, please

168
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,561
You guys come with me

169
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:19,841
Yes

170
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,240
Lord Chow, why are you visiting all of a sudden

171
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,680
I see you weak on weekdays

172
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
I didn't expect to take the lead today

173
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
Wars of Words Ning Wang Shizi

174
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,761
I admire you

175
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,161
General Han is over-praised

176
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,441
Forced by circumstances

177
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,200
Zhou Yue can only fight hard

178
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,561
When you go out,

179
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:44,520
I see Qi Mao

180
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Come with soldiers at Jingwangfu

181
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,761
I'm afraid your highness is in trouble

182
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,721
So I came here

183
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:50,721
Fortunately, in time

184
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,400
Otherwise, your highness and Qi Mao will meet each other

185
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm afraid it's even harder to save the fish

186
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,761
Let's not talk about this

187
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,841
How is the fish now

188
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,561
I haven't eaten for several days

189
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,800
Now I know that Jilu is dead

190
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,881
It is even more disheartened

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,281
The man who can save the fish now

192
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,721
I'm afraid it's only your highness

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,240
Ben Wang is going to see her

194
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,680
But Qi Mao is at the door

195
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,121
I'm afraid it's not easy to go out

196
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,240
I have a way

197
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,081
Wait

198
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:45,441
Qi Zhang had an affair with the outside world

199
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:47,001
Give me a search

200
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,480
See if you can find anything

201
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,521
A prince

202
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,840
Xiaguan, how offended he was just now

203
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,441
Please forgive me

204
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,600
You just had every word

205
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
I don't seem to be afraid of offending me.

206
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,720
Why don't you let the search

207
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,920
Afraid of finding something. Come on

208
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
If found out

209
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,800
The prince is right

210
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,240
I can't find it

211
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,881
The prince is good at breaking into Jingwangfu in front

212
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:12,961
Insulting the court life officer in the street

213
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
If this gets out,

214
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,761
I'm afraid the sovereign can't afford it

215
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,321
What a Zhou Yue

216
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,401
Your Zhou family is down and out

217
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:23,840
Dare to threaten me

218
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,321
Zhou Fu is down and out

219
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:27,480
Naturally, I dare not compete with Ning Wang

220
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,521
I have been in business since I was a child in Zhou Yue

221
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:30,600
Fuchengtaobai

222
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,561
Nothing else

223
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,040
There are many fair-weather friends in Jianghu

224
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,641
I heard that

225
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,840
It seems that Ning Wang is in Jiangnan

226
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,480
Also involved in some industries

227
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:46,680
It's just black powder banned by the court

228
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,160
I can't believe I know this

229
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,360
My prince, Zhou Yue is a businessman

230
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,201
Don't want to do business at a loss

231
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,001
I don't want to cause trouble

232
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:02,240
I will keep my mouth shut about today

233
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,280
Please also ask the prince

234
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,441
Don't embarrass me needlessly

235
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:13,600
Let's go

236
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:16,480
Go

237
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:32,201
Be careful

238
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,401
Go over there and have a look

239
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,761
Why don't you go back first

240
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:39,360
Yes

241
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,441
Zhou Yue

242
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,561
Thank you for what happened just now

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
Your Highness need not thank you

244
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
To save the fish

245
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,600
How many times have you taken risks

246
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:59,600
Even at the expense of life in times of crisis

247
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,321
It should be Zhou Yue who should say thank you

248
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,600
Zhou Yue

249
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:08,280
The Xiaorongwang case is not only related to the family

250
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,081
Even implicated

251
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,360
Some things in Yongzhou

252
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:12,240
Ben Wang saved Ah Yu

253
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,600
Between Ben Wang and A Yu

254
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,920
Your Highness misunderstood

255
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,641
I don't mean anything when I say this

256
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,441
But from the heart

257
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,240
The truth of my marriage with A Yu

258
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,001
Your Highness must have known it already

259
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,321
We're just in the name of a husband and wife

260
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,761
More often than not

261
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:32,881
We are friends and confidants

262
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,961
I'm sorry about your highness and the fish

263
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,561
I don't care

264
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,800
Your Highness doesn't have to worry about it

265
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,121
But after all, in name

266
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:43,720
She's your wife

267
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,081
This king should avoid suspicion

268
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,160
I have talked about this matter with A Yu for a long time

269
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,001
After the case comes to light,

270
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,160
We can separate from each other

271
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,201
By then

272
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,201
What choice does Ah Yu make

273
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,800
Zhou Yue will give full support

274
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,001
Bless her

275
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,920
Now Ah Yu is in prison

276
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,680
We should work together to save her

277
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,561
As for the mouth of others

278
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:11,441
We don't have to care

279
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,081
Yes

280
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,840
What you said is absolutely true

281
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:17,201
That's right

282
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,321
King Ning's sale of black powder

283
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:20,280
How do you know

284
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:24,800
Since we have to deal with them,

285
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,680
Naturally, it is necessary to probe some information

286
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,521
It's just spending more silver

287
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,641
Zhou Yue has no other skills

288
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,920
What can be done for Your Highness and A Yu

289
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,720
That's all that's left

290
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,920
You can rest assured

291
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,040
Ben Wang will definitely think of a way

292
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,160
Save the sinking fish

293
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,720
Let's go

294
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:13,001
Your Highness, I'll wait here

295
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,001
To make a long story short

296
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,521
Go and give Grandma Five something to eat and wear

297
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:19,401
Go back quickly

298
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,081
Yes

299
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,720
A Yue

300
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,561
I was delayed today and came late

301
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,800
I heard Jilu killed himself

302
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,800
Come with me for a moment

303
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,040
High ink

304
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
Ji Lu is the only witness to the family's reversal of the case

305
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,201
Why don't you send someone to guard it

306
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,680
He's dead. What about the fish

307
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,561
Don't worry yet

308
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,641
I didn't expect Jilu to kill himself either

309
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,441
I know you hate your family

310
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,800
There is also prejudice against the fish

311
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:02,081
But I always believed

312
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:04,240
You are a man who understands the rights and wrongs

313
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,480
But you know that Ji Lu is an important witness

314
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,720
And let him go

315
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:09,641
What exactly is the intention

316
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:11,441
What do you mean

317
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,040
I deliberately didn't send someone to guard Jilu and let him die

318
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,761
At least you didn't take care of it carefully

319
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,800
Yes

320
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,561
I didn't send someone to guard Jilu

321
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,800
But I didn't mean to

322
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,321
It should be aimed at the meaning of Shen Yu

323
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,761
Now Gu's family is accused again

324
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,321
Murder Xiao Rong Wang and my aunt

325
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
You tell me

326
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,480
What should I do right

327
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,401
High ink

328
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,441
You calm down and think about it

329
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,521
If it's really your highness and fish

330
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:43,441
Intentional design

331
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,840
Then they will take risks

332
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,961
Bring Jilu back to Beijing

333
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,280
Let him testify in court

334
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,001
They were wronged

335
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,920
I don't know if I was wronged

336
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:53,201
All I know is that right now

337
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,600
Witness and material evidence are all there

338
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:56,920
Until new evidence comes out

339
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,961
Shen Yu's suspect identity

340
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:00,160
Can't be changed

341
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:01,840
A Yue

342
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,321
I understand that you have a good relationship

343
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,040
But I don't want you to get involved in this right and wrong either

344
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:09,001
It's dangerous, you know

345
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,001
I understand

346
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,641
But I'm not afraid

347
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:12,720
A Yue

348
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,521
Anyway

349
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,881
I must save the fish

350
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:18,600
You don't have to talk to me anymore

351
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,720
A fish

352
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:46,961
A fish

353
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:56,641
You're here

354
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Isn't it cold here

355
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:02,441
It's all right

356
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,081
Not cold

357
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:05,840
It's all my fault

358
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,720
It's because I didn't think carefully

359
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,240
It has nothing to do with you

360
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:14,081
You're doing great

361
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,641
Really

362
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:17,920
You can rest assured

363
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:20,720
I'll find a way to get you out of here

364
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,441
I believe you

365
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,561
Why are you dressed like this

366
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:31,280
Is it a family case

367
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
You're implicated

368
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:33,761
It doesn't hurt

369
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,240
The emperor just put me under house arrest

370
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,521
He did not condemn me

371
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,920
If it weren't for me,

372
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,480
You are still the high-ranking King Jing, His Royal Highness

373
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,160
I shouldn't have put you

374
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,840
Get involved in this storm with no retreat

375
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,161
A fish

376
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,401
There is no involvement between you and me

377
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,121
I volunteered everything

378
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,320
You don't have to blame yourself

379
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,720
We've done everything we can

380
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,161
Or let King Ning take the lead

381
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,720
Now Jilu is dead

382
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,881
Gu Jia has no possibility of reversing his verdict anymore

383
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,320
A fish

384
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,840
The more it comes to this time,

385
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,881
The more calm you have to be

386
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:24,041
To think of the way to save

387
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:25,600
Don't panic

388
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:29,080
I'm not giving up on this

389
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,840
Don't give up easily either

390
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,801
Will you wait for me here

391
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,200
Good

392
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,881
And what Jilu said that day

393
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,320
Poisoning in Yongzhou

394
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,801
I won't believe it

395
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,080
I believe you

396
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,281
And trust your father

397
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,960
Everyone says that the Lord of Yongzhou

398
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,161
Highly respected

399
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,041
Mercy, benevolence and righteousness are supported by the people

400
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Such a person

401
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,761
How could he have murdered the prince

402
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,401
Right

403
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,921
I think

404
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,960
Jilu must have been threatened by King Ning

405
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:12,840
Only build words and frame them

406
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,200
Trying to alienate you and me

407
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:16,641
But I still don't understand

408
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:17,681
He knew he was

409
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:18,521
Even if it is anti-water

410
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:19,881
King Ning will not let him go

411
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:21,440
Why would he do that

412
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,281
Maybe he has something else in the hands of King Ning

413
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,881
A fish

414
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,720
You think about it again

415
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,761
Is there any relationship with Cai's and Ji Lu

416
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,041
A related person or thing

417
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,921
Mother Cai seems to have a son

418
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:41,840
But

419
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,921
But he died of illness

420
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,720
Chua's son

421
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:49,521
Chua's son may have been born to Ji Lu

422
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,001
Do you remember

423
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,281
When we made an agreement with Jilu that day,

424
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:54,641
He said he wanted to go to Jizhou

425
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,121
Maybe their son is not dead

426
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:02,921
I'm going out of town today

427
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:04,281
You take care of the fish for me

428
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:05,921
Your Highness, rest assured

429
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:07,480
Even if you try your best,

430
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,080
I will also protect the fish

431
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,560
Helanya

432
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,121
Why is she here

433
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,960
Then I'll go first

434
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,121
Miss He

435
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,041
Lord Chow

436
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:46,681
Miss He is courteous

437
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:49,720
Lord Chow

438
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:51,641
I reminded you that day

439
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,641
Your lady

440
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:55,881
Sooner or later, you will be killed

441
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,080
Now

442
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,240
It really came true

443
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,121
Then presumably Miss He

444
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,281
I also remember what Zhou said that day

445
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,881
Even if there is a great disaster,

446
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,080
I'll bear it

447
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:07,720
Then I'll wait and see

448
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:08,681
Miss He

449
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,921
Why are you here

450
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:11,681
Tall man

451
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,641
Lanya has a few words to say to you

452
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:15,761
Let's talk about it in the inner hall

453
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,041
A Yue

454
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,161
I have something to say to you, too

455
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,521
Let's go together

456
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,761
Miss He

457
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:27,440
Please

458
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:41,641
Miss He

459
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:43,320
I don't know if you came to the punishments department

460
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,080
What is the so-called thing

461
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:49,960
Lanya brought some milk snacks

462
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,401
Want to give early adopters to tall people

463
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,121
There are a few other things

464
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:55,480
Want to tell tall people

465
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,681
I wonder if I could borrow a word

466
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,121
Snacks are not needed

467
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:03,720
As for other things,

468
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,641
Gao said before

469
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:09,200
Lord Zhou and I have no back words

470
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,480
Miss He, but it doesn't hurt to say it

471
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,240
Lanya came this time

472
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,041
I want to explain it to tall people

473
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,240
Although Mrs. Zhou is a remnant of her family,

474
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,041
It does have some kinship with me

475
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,161
But after all, time is long

476
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,401
So on the day of the flower viewing party,

477
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:33,440
Lanya didn't recognize the family remnants

478
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,041
Can you stop taking care of the remnants of your family one by one

479
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Zhou's adult Lan Yake said something wrong

480
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,801
Little people abandon their books without festivals and go to the end

481
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,921
Thinking about it with joy and thinking about it with anger

482
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,641
I once heard that

483
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:58,401
He Jia once took care of his family

484
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,080
It is also favored by the family

485
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,521
Drinking water needs to think about the source

486
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,041
Now Miss He

487
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,360
So eager to get rid of the family

488
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,281
If outsiders know

489
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,521
I thought Lord He and Miss He

490
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,801
It's those treacherous little people

491
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
Take care of the family and murder the emperor's heir

492
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,320
All sins deserve death

493
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:21,041
Even though she has a trace of kindness with our family,

494
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,041
But as courtiers, we

495
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,761
Even with the stigma of betrayal,

496
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:27,641
Shouldn't we put righteousness above family loyalty

497
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,281
Lord Chow

498
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,440
You are the doctor of the criminal department of the imperial court

499
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,001
You can't even understand this truth, can you

500
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:36,840
That's enough

501
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:38,281
Miss He

502
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:40,161
Lord Zhou has always been elegant

503
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,161
Be inarticulate

504
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,440
Even if the family is guilty,

505
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,401
It has nothing to do with Lord Zhou

506
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,761
You are so aggressive

507
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,360
What is it again

508
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,240
Lanya thought

509
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,840
Gao's family is the victim of Xiaorongwang's case

510
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,161
Tall people at this time

511
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,200
I should hate taking care of my family most

512
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:01,480
In fact, don't say it's a tall man

513
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:02,681
It's Lanya

514
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,360
On weekdays, I go to the palace to feel the pulse of Xiaorong Wang

515
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,121
Watching the child live in such pain

516
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,320
Everyone thinks

517
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:11,761
Those who poisoned deserve to die

518
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,921
Of course the poisoner deserves to die

519
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,960
It's just that the case is not over yet

520
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,521
It is too early to say at present

521
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,521
Shen Yu is also good

522
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,440
Take care of your family

523
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,881
Until the day when the truth comes out

524
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,480
Own public opinion

525
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:31,360
Don't worry about Miss Lao He now

526
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:33,521
Not to deliver

527
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,320
Go

528
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,240
Lan Ya

529
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,401
Why are you here

530
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:09,080
I made some milk cakes

531
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,320
I want to bring you a taste

532
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,121
Try it another day

533
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:12,600
I heard that Qi Zhang's brother was under house arrest

534
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
I have to go and see him

535
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:17,401
Now King Jing has a deep fish in his heart

536
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,641
What can you do if you go

537
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,001
Why don't you go down first

538
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,681
This family remnant

539
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:26,801
It's really a funeral star

540
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,360
Make our Zhou family restless and don't talk

541
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,080
Now I still seduce Qi Zhang's brother

542
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,161
It really pisses me off

543
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,401
His Royal Highness King Jing has maintained Shenyu many times

544
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,440
Even at the risk

545
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
I think so

546
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,360
Even if it is implicated

547
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,881
He is also willing

548
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,521
Rural women

549
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,281
I don't know what ecstasy method I used

550
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,200
First, I was fascinated by the fifth brother

551
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,720
Now I still want to seduce Qi Zhang's brother

552
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,801
What a shameless bitch

553
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,281
No matter what magic she has,

554
00:26:57,521 --> 00:26:59,240
Now he is in prison

555
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,921
I can't find any tricks

556
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,320
But Yihui

557
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,641
Now it's you

558
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:06,681
The best time to approach King Jing

559
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:07,761
I know

560
00:27:07,881 --> 00:27:09,521
That's why I'm going to King Wang Fu

561
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,121
So what are you going to say

562
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,240
I told him to stay away from that jinx

563
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,801
You are too quick-tempered

564
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,480
And the temper is too honest and frank

565
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,240
You will suffer if you do this

566
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,641
Actually

567
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:26,881
If you want to walk in

568
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,720
A man's heart is simple

569
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,041
Just remember eight words

570
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,801
What eight words

571
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:37,801
Give it what it likes and overcome it with softness

572
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,641
Since King Jing cares about Shen Yu

573
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:43,281
Then you also act like you care

574
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:46,200
Take away his guard against you

575
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,281
Make him trust you

576
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,121
And after that

577
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:51,281
Show your tenderness at the right time

578
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,041
That Shen fish is rude and outrageous

579
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,641
But you are gentle as water

580
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,281
At that time

581
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:59,600
King Jing's balance will naturally favor you

582
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:01,641
There seems to be some truth in that

583
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,641
Treat men

584
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,560
Sure enough, I still need some wrists

585
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,001
Lan Ya

586
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:09,161
Thank you

587
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,041
We are good sisters without thanks

588
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,521
Besides

589
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,480
I see that your Zhou family is very affectionate and righteous

590
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
Just like your fifth brother and tall people

591
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,281
It is also a brotherly love

592
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:26,600
Maintain each other

593
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,001
It's more than love

594
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,600
I think they are very affectionate

595
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:31,121
Since childhood

596
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:32,881
Then Gao Mo likes to pester my fifth brother

597
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,161
If my fifth brother is a daughter

598
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,681
Gao Mo came to propose marriage early, didn't he

599
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:44,881
Emperor

600
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
It is also the foundation of loyalty for ministers

601
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,881
I greatly enlighten the country and enrich the people

602
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:52,401
It relies on the monarch, minister and people with one heart

603
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,401
But now

604
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,360
King Jing openly colluded with the remnants of taking care of his family

605
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,281
Forging evidence to buy witness

606
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,600
You know

607
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,240
In those days, the case of Xiaorong Wang was the emperor's personal reason

608
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,240
King Jing's move

609
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,761
Is to despise my great laws

610
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,440
Put the emperor above the charcoal fire

611
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,840
Emperor

612
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:15,881
I also heard that

613
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,041
His Royal Highness King Jing and the Shen Shi woman

614
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,801
There are still children's affairs

615
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,921
A minister

616
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:22,681
Regal is the first thing in the matter

617
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,121
If this relationship

618
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:25,560
Spread among the people

619
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,921
It really hurts my Lord's face

620
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:29,121
Yes, Your Majesty

621
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,041
King Jing regards my great enlightenment as nothing

622
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,600
Regard royal dignity as invisible

623
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,681
Collusion with a traitor

624
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:39,960
The wolf's ambition has become obvious

625
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:42,281
These rebellious people

626
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,320
How can I be qualified to choose Chu Jun

627
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,521
The emperor's micro-minister suggested

628
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,240
Withdraw Jingwang's alternative qualification

629
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,720
Imprison him in a fief

630
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,281
You are not allowed to enter Beijing without a letter

631
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:01,960
Dear Ai Qing

632
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,001
It's one heart and one mind

633
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,401
King Ning

634
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,440
What do you think

635
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,281
Emperor

636
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:25,240
My brother thought that your ministers were worrying too much

637
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,480
King Jing is young

638
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,200
Be confused by emotion for a while

639
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,480
It's pity to go astray

640
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,720
There is an old saying

641
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,440
Knowing mistakes can improve a lot

642
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,600
Please give it to King Jing

643
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,801
A chance to turn over a new leaf

644
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,320
Strict responsibility

645
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,240
Slow penalty

646
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,080
Emperor

647
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,480
Ning Wang's benevolence is a blessing for me

648
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,440
Only the law is strict

649
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:56,240
If you are partial to others

650
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,801
How can the people be convinced

651
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:59,121
People will think that

652
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:01,001
That King occupies Yongzhou

653
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
My court is afraid of it

654
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,960
Therefore, I implore the emperor

655
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,720
Sacred heart judgment

656
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,041
Pursuing one's responsibility and correcting one's testimonies

657
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,001
Qiao Shangshu

658
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,960
As you said

659
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
Jingwang Yimai guards Yongzhou

660
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,401
Even if King Jing is not young and ignorant,

661
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:23,240
Also want to scruple about the merits of the first king

662
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:28,001
Emperor

663
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,681
Xianjing Wang has made great achievements

664
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,960
The merits of the border are unparalleled in the world

665
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,801
It is also deeply loved by the people in Yongzhou

666
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,320
If you really dispose of King Jing,

667
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,240
I'm afraid it will hurt the hearts of the people in Yongzhou

668
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,240
That's enough

669
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,161
I

670
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:53,521
I'm a little tired today

671
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,801
We'll discuss it another day

672
00:31:58,121 --> 00:31:58,801
Sovereign

673
00:31:59,041 --> 00:31:59,960
Ladies and gentlemen

674
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:01,001
Have you all returned it?

675
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,200
One step at a time

676
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,921
Worry of the Four Seas

677
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:50,840
If you were me

678
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
When how to decide

679
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:58,761
My brother is afraid to die

680
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:01,001
Everything is decided by the emperor

681
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:02,921
You

682
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,121
You're always so careful

683
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,360
Do things effectively

684
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:13,360
I want to reward you

685
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,681
My brother is sheltered by the emperor

686
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:22,840
I can't thank you enough

687
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,440
Where do you dare to be rewarded

688
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,560
My brother only hopes

689
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,921
Nothing in the world

690
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,161
Long-term companion king

691
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,480
This owner

692
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:51,121
I thought we agreed to just go to the punishments department to see Shen Yu

693
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,001
Why don't you come back

694
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:09,281
Leave Beijing

695
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:27,801
Shit

696
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,960
Pick up some more water quickly

697
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,881
Bring water

698
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,080
Here comes the water

699
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,401
How can this fire get bigger and bigger

700
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:38,320
Yes, why can't this fire be extinguished

701
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,521
Come back to the water quickly

702
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:40,281
Be careful

703
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:40,881
Hurry up

704
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,360
Fierce gunpowder

705
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,681
No wonder the fire is swift and difficult to extinguish

706
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:48,480
Quickly

707
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:49,641
Don't stop

708
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,480
Here comes the water

709
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,001
This big brother

710
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,080
Excuse me, is the family name of this fire family Ji

711
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Yes, it's Ji

712
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:57,240
You said it was a big summer

713
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,401
So damp

714
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,161
Save people quickly

715
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:00,801
Old Ji and his grandson are still inside

716
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:01,801
Come on, hurry up

717
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,881
Quickly

718
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,320
Be careful

719
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,801
It's over

720
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,080
I can't save it

721
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,921
This Ji family is old and young

722
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:21,281
It's just gone

723
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:23,720
I can't save it. I can't save it

724
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,080
This childe

725
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,080
Meet Lao Ji's family

726
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,281
Distant relatives

727
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
This old Ji is also very miserable

728
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:40,320
It has been seven or eight years since I moved to our village

729
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:41,840
This means having a son

730
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,121
But no one has seen it

731
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,681
All these years

732
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:46,840
He lived alone with his grandson

733
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:51,041
A few days ago

734
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,961
Suddenly a letter came from his son

735
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,040
Said he would pick up his grandson

736
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,600
But who would have thought of it

737
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,921
The son didn't wait

738
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:00,000
But wait for a bunch of butlers

739
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:01,401
A butler

740
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,280
Although they are wearing casual clothes,

741
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,000
But it was still by the village

742
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,961
People who have been in court have been recognized

743
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,760
Said their carry-on knives

744
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
It's an official knife

745
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:13,360
That's what people who work for officials can have

746
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,721
A fire burns nothing

747
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,721
It seems that I guessed correctly

748
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:19,280
It was King Ning who found them

749
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,161
As a threat

750
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:21,280
Ji Lu will suddenly change his mouth

751
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,000
Made false testimony

752
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,121
Our villagers guess

753
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,000
That must be Lao Ji's son

754
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,481
What kind of trouble did you get out there

755
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,481
You said this old Ji

756
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:31,401
This is the kindest person on weekdays

757
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
I can also read and write

758
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
People in this village like them very much

759
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:35,760
Right

760
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
Yeah yeah

761
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,441
Why do you think this is the case?

762
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:43,481
Then put it this way

763
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,481
The fire was set by those officials

764
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:48,441
This is also strange to say

765
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,760
The gang left yesterday

766
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,040
It has nothing to do with them by rights

767
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:55,241
But there was a good fire here

768
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:57,441
That can't be ordered by that grandson, can it

769
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,080
Pity

770
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,000
Both father and grandson burned to death

771
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,921
It's pathetic

772
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:05,600
Yeah

773
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,401
The father and grandson of Ji's family can handle it well

774
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:13,401
It's all taken care of

775
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:14,360
According to your orders

776
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,921
First put out the mouth and then poured oil to burn the house

777
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,201
Make sure you don't leave any evidence

778
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,681
It's just

779
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:22,721
Say

780
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:24,121
Let's deal with it privately like this

781
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:25,560
Would it be inappropriate

782
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,360
After all, the prince promised Jilu

783
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,441
As long as he is willing to bite back at King Jing and end it on his own

784
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,800
We let his children and his father go

785
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:34,481
I'm putting an end to hidden dangers

786
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,040
In a matter like this

787
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,121
Be trustworthy

788
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,681
Is to leave evil for yourself in the future

789
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:43,681
The reason why cutting grass requires rooting

790
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:46,360
Do you still need me to teach you

791
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,320
Yes

792
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:49,681
Young Master Wise

793
00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:51,441
That's right

794
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,000
There is no need to inform the sovereign of this matter

795
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,121
It is the subordinate who resigns

796
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,681
Even the elderly and children are spared

797
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:07,921
Ning Wang seems to have lost his mind

798
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,360
Children

799
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,161
Why did you stop me

800
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:19,560
You are a relative of Xiaofeng

801
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,520
Xiaofeng

802
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:21,800
Ji Xiaofeng

803
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,401
You just told Uncle Zhao

804
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,520
You are a distant relative of the Ji family

805
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,000
Ji Xiaofeng

806
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,560
Yes, then why did you stop me

807
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,921
This is for you

808
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:34,681
What is this

809
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:37,800
Xiaofeng took this box the other day

810
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,201
Show off in front of me

811
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,520
Said his father sent him a letter

812
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,481
I also sent good things from the city

813
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:46,481
He laughed at me for not seeing the world

814
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,000
I got into a fight with him

815
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,161
And grabbed this box

816
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,000
A letter sent to him by his father

817
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:56,241
I wanted to give it back to him today

818
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:58,881
I didn't expect his house to catch fire

819
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:01,121
I'll never see him again

820
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,600
All right

821
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,840
You don't have to blame yourself

822
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,641
None of us want this kind of thing

823
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,481
Go home

824
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,360
Drive

825
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:25,721
Drive

826
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:27,040
Drive

827
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:30,721
Stop

828
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,161
Have a good time

829
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,721
Go inside

830
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:44,921
Brother Qi Zhang, I came to see you

831
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,520
This owner

832
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:57,481
You don't take me with you when you go out on business

833
00:39:58,641 --> 00:40:00,560
There is not even a person to talk to

834
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,121
I'm bored to death

835
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:10,800
Brother Qi Zhang

836
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
I'm Yi Hui

837
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,161
I came to see you

838
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Zhou Yihui

839
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:17,040
Why is she here

840
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,121
Brother Qi Zhang

841
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:21,360
I've heard all about King Palace

842
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:22,840
You can rest assured

843
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,961
I am different from those who fall into the rain

844
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,040
I certainly won't stand by and watch

845
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,800
Come on and watch

846
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,641
Brother Qi Zhang

847
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,080
I heard you in there

848
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,080
Then I'll come in

849
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:38,360
Uninvited entry

850
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,080
I really don't treat myself as an outsider

851
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,201
Brother Qi Zhang

852
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,040
Yi Hui is no one else

853
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,201
You don't have to hide like this, do you

854
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,040
Don't come over

855
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,121
Brother Qi Zhang

856
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:53,401
Your voice

857
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,721
I

858
00:40:57,961 --> 00:41:01,000
Ben Wang has been in a bit of a manic mood recently

859
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,840
A little irritated

860
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,721
So the sound is different from the past

861
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:07,800
Cousin doesn't need to worry about it

862
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:10,520
It's Shen Shi's fault for the pest

863
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:14,080
She left herself with no retreat. She won't say anything

864
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,040
It also caused Qi Zhang's brother to fall here

865
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Brother Qi Zhang

866
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,600
I just cooked some bitter gourd juice

867
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,121
Why don't you come out for a drink

868
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,961
Don't drink

869
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:28,840
What Ben Wang means is

870
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:32,401
The king's heart is extremely depressed

871
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:34,280
If you drink this bitter water again,

872
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:37,961
I'm afraid I'm going to beat my chest and beat my feet

873
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:39,921
Right, too

874
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,681
It is Yihui who is thoughtless

875
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:44,481
No harm

876
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,320
Cousin can come to see Ben Wang

877
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,401
My king's heart is as sweet as honey

878
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,961
Really? Brother Qi Zhang

879
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:51,600
Don't come over

880
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:54,441
Brother Qi Zhang

881
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,721
Yihui just wants to do something for you

882
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,600
What can I do for you

883
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,161
I will definitely try my best to finish it

884
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,320
I didn't expect Qi Zhang's brother

885
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,600
What I did was leave

886
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,921
Brother Qi Zhang

887
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:13,721
Then you can have a rest

888
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:15,360
Yi Hui will come to see you another day

889
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,681
What the owner asked me to send to the little lady

890
00:42:44,681 --> 00:42:45,681
I almost forgot

891
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,320
It's time for dinner. It's time for dinner

892
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:29,800
Eat quickly

893
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,241
What are you looking at me for

894
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:42,600
It's really a tiger falling Pingyang being bullied by dogs

895
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,721
You come here

896
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,280
What's the matter

897
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,481
Will you deliver meals

898
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:51,481
You're new here

899
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,280
Which principal gave you a pre-career lecture

900
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,360
You call him here for me

901
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,320
I'll have a good talk with him

902
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,121
Tai Kai Division Prisoner Supervision Regulations

903
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,681
You can scream when you say so

904
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:01,560
You're a death row prisoner

905
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,161
The shelf is not small yet

906
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:05,121
What is this

907
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm telling you

908
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,800
The last time I went out of here

909
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,840
It's your predecessors in prison

910
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,000
It's for me to carry out

911
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,481
Why don't you blow it

912
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:13,840
You don't care if I blow it or not

913
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,201
I'm telling you

914
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,441
You should give me a good share of this meal today

915
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,080
Our business will be over

916
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,241
If you don't

917
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,320
You

918
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:22,760
Consequences at one's own risk

919
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,441
Neuropathy

920
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,040
Have backbone

921
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:34,560
It is worthy of our highness

922
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
A little lady who is haunted by dreams

923
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,161
Being in this prison of the criminal department

924
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:39,721
But you can still be free and easy

925
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,760
Han someone really admires it

926
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
General Han, why are you here

927
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:46,080
To replace our royal highness

928
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,161
Look at the little lady

929
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,961
He's worried that you're in prison

930
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:50,881
Don't drop water, don't think about tea and rice

931
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,481
I was specially told to come and see it often

932
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:56,000
It won't

933
00:44:56,681 --> 00:44:58,681
Isn't it not time to die yet

934
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:00,360
I won't let myself starve to death

935
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:02,481
Besides

936
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,201
Your Highness promised me that he would help me find evidence

937
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:07,320
I will live well until he comes back

938
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:09,121
That's the spirit

939
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:13,080
Your Highness asked me to give you

940
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,121
General Lao Han

941
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,360
Any news from Your Highness

942
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:24,961
Not yet

943
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:27,681
But little lady, rest assured

944
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:29,600
Our highness has always been safe in doing things

945
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,560
Besides, I also heard that

946
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,881
Your little Xianggong is also trying his best to deal with it outside

947
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,560
Of course I can rest assured

948
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,040
Jilu is dead

949
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,520
If you want to find any more evidence

950
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,161
I'm afraid it's very difficult

951
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,320
Lord Han

952
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:49,760
Lord Han

953
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:54,401
Lord Chow

954
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:57,280
Han just came to adjust a file

955
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,961
Don't embarrass me

956
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,121
I'm just a guy

957
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:02,721
Shaoqing in Dali Temple

958
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,280
Family case

959
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,840
I really can't afford it

960
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,600
Lord Han

961
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,641
This case needs to be examined by three divisions

962
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:09,840
Dali Temple is the presiding judge

963
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,600
Zhou Yue begged Han adults to reorganize the case

964
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,280
Never close the case hastily

965
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:16,721
Lord Chow

966
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,840
Dali Temple has its own process of handling cases in Dali Temple

967
00:46:20,441 --> 00:46:21,080
Now

968
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,681
This family murdered the emperor's heir

969
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,961
It has become an indisputable fact

970
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:28,161
I advise Lord Zhou not to involve too much

971
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,881
Lest

972
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,800
Bring disaster to the upper body

973
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,401
The case is not over yet

974
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:34,481
Han's adult made such nonsense

975
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:36,600
Aren't you afraid of rehabilitating your family in the future

976
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,760
Do you bear the charges after framing loyal ministers

977
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:41,360
Lord Zhou, what do you mean by this

978
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:43,961
Are you threatening Han

979
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:48,681
Lord Han

980
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,161
Zhou Yue is also eager to protect his wife

981
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:52,721
A moment of inappropriate speech

982
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,241
Wang Han Da Ren Hai Han

983
00:47:09,401 --> 00:47:10,000
Zhou Yue

984
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,721
You are an officer of the Criminal Department

985
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,881
It should be known that interfering in judicial proceedings is a capital crime

986
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:17,360
Are you out of your mind

987
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,241
Anyway

988
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,881
I must save the fish
