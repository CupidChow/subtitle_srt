1
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,759
You are now guilty of death

2
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,159
No one can protect you

3
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,640
But I was wronged

4
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,359
That's enough

5
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,359
Shen fish

6
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,359
Ever since you rushed into my Zhou's door,

7
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,839
How much trouble big and small have caused me

8
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,839
Now you are a prisoner

9
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,720
Now you want me to run and work for you

10
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,480
Do you still think it's not enough to bring trouble to my Zhou family

11
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,839
Xianggong

12
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:13,560
You

13
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,599
Since

14
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
The words have been made so clear

15
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
I don't have to hide you anymore

16
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,079
Actually

17
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,919
These silver tickets

18
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,200
It's not mine

19
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,480
Your big nephew asked me to bring it to you

20
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,919
My eldest nephew

21
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,360
That's right

22
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,439
Your big nephew said

23
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,120
All the money I owe you is here

24
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,640
He doesn't want to be indebted to a dead man

25
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,239
As for these silver tickets,

26
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,439
It doesn't matter if you throw it away

27
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
Or eat it

28
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,200
Whatever you want

29
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,439
How does this silver ticket smell like medicine

30
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,880
Your big nephew asked me to tell you

31
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,160
After you were beheaded,

32
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,120
Corpse

33
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,520
He'll send someone to claim it

34
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,920
You can rest assured

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,800
Zhou Yue

36
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,999
How cruel is your heart

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,039
I'm in prison without injustice. You can forget it if you don't help me

38
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,160
I am at least the wife of your Zhou family

39
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,439
After I died, my ancestral graves wouldn't let me in

40
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,600
You are really a waste of your husband

41
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,200
I am a wasted husband

42
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
So when you kill people,

43
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,039
Have you ever thought about your husband's feelings

44
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,079
I didn't kill anyone. How many times do you make me say it

45
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,999
I can't be slandered by others

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
None of us in bed believe me

47
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,840
Can you believe it or not? I'm bumping into my head now

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
I prove my innocence

49
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,160
It's easy for you to say

50
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,679
Even if you die now

51
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,759
Chua, who was killed by you, can't come back either

52
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,240
I didn't kill Chua. How many times do you want me to say it

53
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,999
You killed it

54
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,359
I didn't kill him

55
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:38,280
Yes

56
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:39,120
No

57
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
Why is there still a quarrel

58
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,200
Come with me

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,439
I didn't kill him

60
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,959
Not you, not you, not you

61
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,160
Walk, walk

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,319
I didn't kill him

63
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,360
You're sitting tight.

64
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
The wife of the punishments doctor was imprisoned for killing people

65
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,679
It has been widely spread all over the capital

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,759
We're not going back

67
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,560
Ning Wang's move is to invite you into the urn

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,039
If I go back

69
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Isn't it just what he wants

70
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,959
How do you say

71
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,159
I guess

72
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,759
At the Wangfu Flower Party

73
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,440
Ning Wang saw that I had more maintenance for Shen Yu

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
And from the mouth of Helanya

75
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,080
Knowing the identity of Shen Yugu's family

76
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,399
Since then

77
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,759
He began to lay out

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,319
Frame Shen Yu for killing people

79
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,080
Make things big

80
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,799
So all he did

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,640
Just to get you to shoot

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,399
If I shoot

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,319
He will tell the world

84
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,200
Tie me to the identity of the remnants of my family

85
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,319
At that time

86
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,399
Not only Shen Yu can be killed

87
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,640
I will also lose the opportunity to compete for reserves

88
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,599
Yongzhou

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,720
It will also be weakened

90
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,000
Ning Wang's move

91
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,599
I want to kill three birds with one stone

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,519
But the news from Zhou Yuelai

93
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:24,799
Yes

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,759
He has given the silver ticket to Shen Yu

95
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,039
It's just that Shen Yu doesn't know your plan

96
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,039
What if something goes wrong

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,039
Be born after death

98
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,480
This is the way out of trouble

99
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,519
As you know, this is a dangerous move

100
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,640
If she doesn't believe you

101
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,920
Or maybe

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,440
The play was screwed up

103
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,399
Then she's really dead

104
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,079
Judging from the smell

105
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,760
This silver ticket is soaked with a lot of bone eclipsing grass

106
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,120
After eating it, people will fake death

107
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
Breath interruption

108
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,399
No pulse at all

109
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,079
If something goes wrong during this period,

110
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,560
I faked death and it came true

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,040
Qi Zhang, this is to make me die

112
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,120
It seems that he already knew that I had been tricked

113
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,519
Then why didn't he remind me

114
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,239
For my own good

115
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,000
Or is there another purpose

116
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:04,239
Father

117
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,239
Sovereign

118
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,440
Spy reward

119
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,359
These days

120
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,280
Qi Zhang has never left the courtyard outside the city

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,440
Sovereign

122
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,880
Seems

123
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,399
In this Qi Zhang's heart,

124
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,959
Shen Yu is far less rich than Jiangshan

125
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,359
Hearsay

126
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,760
Yongzhou estrus species

127
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,799
Old King of Scenery in those days

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,880
It is also abandoning the country for beauty

129
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,440
Now it seems that

130
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,000
I really underestimated him

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,359
It seems that this move

132
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,959
Is a failure

133
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,840
Chess meets the enemy

134
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,919
Is the most interesting thing about playing chess

135
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,720
The King

136
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,239
Let's

137
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,320
What to do next

138
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,760
The Way of Game

139
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,040
Not looking at your opponent

140
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,840
How many chips are there

141
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,079
And the comparison is

142
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,239
Your courage and patience

143
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,880
Qi Zhang thinks himself

144
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
I use Shen fish as bait

145
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,040
Dare not kill her

146
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,840
So

147
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,239
It's always been so calm

148
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:13,760
Then

149
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,399
I'll give him one

150
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,199
Take a surprise

151
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,880
Sovereign

152
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
So what you mean is

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Command punishments department

154
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,519
At noon tomorrow

155
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,359
Chop fish in place

156
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:31,760
Yes

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,679
Father

158
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:37,919
Father

159
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,320
Report from the punishments department

160
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,040
Shen Shi committed suicide

161
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:42,799
What

162
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
It's all my fault

163
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,799
If I had a few days ago

164
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,679
Don't talk so hard to her

165
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,320
She won't get over it

166
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,359
It's all my fault

167
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Don't think so much

168
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,359
Let's bury her earlier

169
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,600
Why are you in such a hurry

170
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,959
It really looks like a dead man

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,079
I'd like to see it

172
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,880
What medicine do you sell in your gourd

173
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,519
Your Excellencies

174
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,040
The little girl was ordered to come to assist in the autopsy

175
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,120
Please make it convenient for everyone

176
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,799
The medical officer's post mortem examination has been completed

177
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:45,160
Prove that Mrs. Zhou crashed into the wall and died

178
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,280
Pulse breath is gone

179
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,880
What else do you want to test

180
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,880
Speaking of which, the little girl also worked with Mrs. Zhou

181
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,040
Have met once

182
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,959
But I think

183
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,440
She doesn't seem like a person who will die easily

184
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm afraid there's nothing fishy about it

185
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,320
My wife's body is here

186
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,880
If Miss He doesn't believe it

187
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,840
Just check it for yourself

188
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,919
Your wife is proficient in medicine herself

189
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,359
Besides

190
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,159
Just now, the tall man also said it

191
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,359
Both the medical officer and the post mortem examiner have confirmed Shen Shi's death

192
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,880
Even if I go to the test again,

193
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,839
Presumably the result is the same

194
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,719
Then why are you talking about this

195
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,279
But

196
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,000
I do have a way

197
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,239
Can you determine whether Shen Shi really killed himself

198
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,880
What is this, Miss He

199
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,560
Determine whether a person is really dead

200
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,760
The most direct way is to

201
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
Let her die again

202
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:45,279
How

203
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,080
Lord Chow

204
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,760
Didn't your wife really die

205
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
The dead are the most important

206
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,560
Miss He

207
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,479
Although Shen Shi is guilty of murder,

208
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,640
But now it has returned to the loess

209
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
Please also ask Miss He

210
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,960
To Shen Shi

211
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,640
Give me the Zhou family, too

212
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,719
Leave a dignity

213
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,919
She's just a prisoner

214
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,120
What face do you want

215
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,640
Miss He

216
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,839
Shen Shi is dead

217
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,400
According to the statute of the great enlightenment

218
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,599
The body of a condemned prisoner

219
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,760
All will be sent to mass graves for burial on the spot

220
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,000
Now the time has passed

221
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,520
Are you trying to get in the way of Gao's errand

222
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,799
Lanya is also worried

223
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,359
Two adults are kind-hearted

224
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,679
Be deceived by others

225
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,799
This is just a moment of urgency

226
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,520
Please forgive me, too

227
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,719
In this case

228
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,120
Bearer

229
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,599
Send Shen Shi to mass graves

230
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,799
Immediate burial

231
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:45,719
Yes

232
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,919
Immediate burial

233
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,760
Better

234
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,839
A fish

235
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,919
This silver bracelet

236
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
It is the heirloom of my Zhou family

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,479
I am guilty of you in Zhou Yue

238
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,799
Just let this bracelet

239
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,359
Let me keep you company here

240
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,080
What are you waiting for to bury

241
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,039
Yes

242
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,599
A fish

243
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,640
You must hold on

244
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,120
You asked me how many days later

245
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,039
Go to mass graves

246
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,799
Save the fish buried alive

247
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,320
Why

248
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,159
Isn't she all right now

249
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,120
If you want her to live

250
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:54,880
Don't ask too many questions

251
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,760
Just listen to my command

252
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,560
What do you want me to do

253
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm afraid it's too late to save the fish if I don't start again

254
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,239
What string songs just ask for

255
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,719
I don't know the prince

256
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,200
Accept or not

257
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,080
Isn't it Zhou Yue's Chongxi wife

258
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,120
Did you kill yourself

259
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,679
She was kind to you

260
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,640
So

261
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,960
You want this prince

262
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,799
Drive away the guards

263
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,880
Let you give her the last ride

264
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:44,960
Trivial matter

265
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,599
Wait for this prince

266
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Finish this pot of wine

267
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,880
Let's start

268
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,960
A prince

269
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,320
Mrs. Zhou has been sent to the mass grave

270
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,880
Be late

271
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,279
I'm afraid I won't see her last time

272
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,719
No hurry, no hurry

273
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,000
A prince

274
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,080
String song

275
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,479
Get up, get up, get up

276
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,799
I'll just take you there

277
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,320
Thank you, Shizi

278
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,440
Go

279
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,919
Why are you here

280
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,239
Something at home

281
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,719
Father asked you to go back to the discussion

282
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,039
No return

283
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,679
I'm busy

284
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,960
It's okay to go

285
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,719
What do you mean, Qi Lian

286
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,159
Take my father and press me, right

287
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,560
Younger brother

288
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
I'm just doing what I'm told

289
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,440
You have guts

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,640
Get out of the way of the prince

291
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,520
A prince

292
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,479
Keep an eye on her. She's not going anywhere

293
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes

294
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,279
The situation has changed speed to save people

295
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,520
What kind of game are you playing

296
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,560
My father felt that the remnants of his family died strangely

297
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,479
Afraid there is fraud in this

298
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,839
You didn't ask me to dig people in mass graves, did you

299
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:13,440
Younger brother

300
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,000
Just come with me

301
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,320
Gu Yi

302
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,599
Whether you really die or fake death this time

303
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,120
I won't let you leave the mass grave alive

304
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,560
Any news from String Song

305
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,359
Not yet

306
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,679
Arguably

307
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,159
This hour

308
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,719
She should be on her way to save people

309
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,560
But I don't know why

310
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,239
There is no signal

311
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,359
There are no flying pigeons

312
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,520
You can't go

313
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,080
You know they're waiting for you

314
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,520
If you go now,

315
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,560
Everything you did before was in vain

316
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,679
You have given the bracelet to Xian Ge and Zhou Yue

317
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
The mass grave is so big

318
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,239
Even if you go,

319
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,839
I can't find her either

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,239
I can't let anything happen to her

321
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,040
Usually, mass graves will be guarded by officers and men

322
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,000
Why is it empty at the moment

323
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,920
No matter

324
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,319
Not here

325
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,000
Big cock

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,680
This hour

327
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,959
It's going to be too late

328
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,239
Shen fish

329
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,199
Don't have an accident

330
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,520
Where are you

331
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,199
Shen fish

332
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,520
You have to hold on

333
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,880
You wait for me to come

334
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,479
Shen fish

335
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,880
Shen fish

336
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,040
Shen fish

337
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,120
I'm coming

338
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,199
Shen fish

339
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,479
Shen fish

340
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,280
Wake up

341
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,280
Wake up

342
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,760
It's all my fault

343
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,640
Blame me

344
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,880
You get up and blame me

345
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,000
You hit me

346
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,760
I order you not to die

347
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,839
I won't let you die

348
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,040
Don't be afraid

349
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,400
I won't let you die

350
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,599
This king won't let you die

351
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,920
You called me from Changtaiban

352
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,160
Come here and feed the mosquitoes

353
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,239
Father expected

354
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,400
Qi Zhang will never abandon Shen Yu

355
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,400
So we were asked to intercept here

356
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,680
I've been waiting for an hour

357
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,719
Are you sure

358
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
He came from here

359
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:45,319
All the gates have been sealed off

360
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,559
This is the only way for him to save people

361
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,880
Coming, coming

362
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,559
It is Qi Zhang's red horse

363
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,680
Stop him

364
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,760
His Royal Highness King Jing

365
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time

366
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,880
I didn't expect you to be really infatuated

367
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,199
Unexpectedly risking one's own life

368
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,959
Save this court prisoner

369
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
Lord Han

370
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,160
This woman behind His Royal Highness King Jing

371
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,120
Not only is she a guilty woman who kills people

372
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,520
It was the same year

373
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,680
The remnants of caring for the family who murdered the emperor's heir

374
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,079
Family remnants

375
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,520
King of Scenery

376
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,120
You openly collude with those who conspire against you

377
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,520
Lord Han can also witness

378
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,520
Please dismount quickly

379
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,520
Enter the palace with me

380
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,199
Waiting for the Holy Judgment

381
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,199
Clouds and Mud Generation

382
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,640
Dare to compete with my Ningwangfu

383
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,640
Waiting for this prince to clean you up personally

384
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,800
How dare Lao Shizi start work

385
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,760
I'm just down here

386
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,160
Unexpected

387
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,120
I'm a light scholar

388
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,959
Actually labor, you adults lined up to meet each other

389
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,239
How flattered

390
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,920
How come it's you

391
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,640
Why can't it be me

392
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,520
You don't have to be proud too early

393
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,800
After all

394
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,959
That is the remnant of caring for the family

395
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,760
The same is a capital crime

396
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,599
Is it

397
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,239
I don't know

398
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,719
Hanging out with my pet dog on my back

399
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,559
Which death penalty law have you committed?

400
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,880
Dare to play us believe it or not I'll kill you

401
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,880
It's the emperor's guards

402
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,520
Ning Wang Shizi led his troops out of the city privately

403
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,040
Against the rule of law

404
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,000
Pass the emperor's oracle

405
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,559
Two princes

406
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,959
Go back to the palace to meet

407
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,439
Where is this

408
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,120
Why am I here

409
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,120
Am I still alive

410
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,920
Why haven't you woken up yet

411
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,439
Ruddy complexion and even breathing

412
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,120
It stands to reason that there is no serious problem

413
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,359
It seems that it is really weakened

414
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,079
I won't wake up for a while

415
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,719
That is

416
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,520
Buried alive in mass graves

417
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,640
There is no one with a hundred and eighty thousand taels

418
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
You can't send me away

419
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,160
What about this medicine

420
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,040
She shouldn't be able to drink it herself

421
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,920
It seems that Ben Wang has to feed it himself

422
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,680
How to feed it in person

423
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,640
Big cock, what do you want

424
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,079
It's over. It's this feeding method

425
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,000
You

426
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:39,839
Don't you come over here

427
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,640
I'll see how long you can pretend

428
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,280
Here he comes

429
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,040
What to do

430
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,680
Forget it

431
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,880
She had a narrow escape

432
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,880
Stop teasing her

433
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,079
I'm awake

434
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
How bitter

435
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,760
That

436
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,359
Your medicine is a little bitter

437
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:44,239
That one replaced gentian with wild chrysanthemum

438
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,559
It will taste much better

439
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,199
Bitter

440
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,439
I

441
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,520
I'm not saying what I just tasted

442
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:57,319
I mean what I smell

443
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,559
You, you know I can smell it, right

444
00:31:58,959 --> 00:31:59,640
You know, right

445
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,040
What are you laughing at

446
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,520
Fortunately

447
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,760
What good thing

448
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,079
I haven't asked you yet

449
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,359
What the hell is going on

450
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,920
Did you know I'd fall into a trap

451
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,719
I also know that I will be buried in mass graves

452
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,599
Why did Zhou Yue cooperate with you

453
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,280
When did you start working together

454
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,880
Who else knows about this plan

455
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,319
Why can't you tell me in advance

456
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,280
I went out looking for wild chrysanthemums

457
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,319
You have a good rest

458
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,479
When I come back

459
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,599
What's the matter with this big rooster

460
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,719
Seems

461
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,640
King Jing has saved the fish

462
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,280
Don't know

463
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,880
Is she awake now

464
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,000
A Yue

465
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,199
Where are you going

466
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,120
Testimony on the theft of blacksmith Li's house

467
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,959
A little vague

468
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,479
I want to check again

469
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,239
I'll go with you

470
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,000
No need

471
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,920
I'll just go by myself

472
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,280
Then go to work

473
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,000
No

474
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,839
Your wife just passed away

475
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,479
Although you fought back your grief

476
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
But I can feel it

477
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,239
The pain in your heart is not enough

478
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,599
Anyway

479
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,520
I won't let you go out alone

480
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,120
Where do you want to go

481
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,719
I'm really out on business

482
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,920
You can rest assured

483
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,400
I won't get over it

484
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,239
That won't work either

485
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,400
You either don't go

486
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,599
Or take me with you

487
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,000
Let go

488
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,559
I don't

489
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:07,800
A Yue

490
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,120
Are you going the wrong way

491
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,719
This is not the way to blacksmith Li's house

492
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,280
High ink

493
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,000
I have one thing

494
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,920
I want to tell you

495
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,559
What did you say

496
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,239
Or

497
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,000
Why don't you get off the horse first

498
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:30,199
Let's talk about it when we dismount

499
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:30,959
No harm

500
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,160
What news can surprise me

501
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,800
You say it quickly

502
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,479
We put the fish

503
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,000
Excavated from the mass grave

504
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,800
What

505
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,959
Why don't you drink it

506
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,000
You won't tell me what's going on

507
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,839
I won't drink it

508
00:34:59,199 --> 00:34:59,959
You drank it

509
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:01,120
I'll tell you

510
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:03,959
Really

511
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,359
Go ahead

512
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,239
What do you want to know

513
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:17,439
All

514
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,520
Are you saying

515
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,959
King Jing discovered it

516
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,280
There is something wrong with Chua's case

517
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,640
His spy report

518
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,439
Qiao Shangshu

519
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,239
Get a windfall

520
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,680
I also sent someone to follow the fish privately

521
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,239
I think I received the benefits of the real murderer

522
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,680
Looking for A Yu to take the blame

523
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,680
So you cooperate with King Jing

524
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,000
Make Shen Yu fake death

525
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:41,880
This is deceiving you, which Ayue

526
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,439
You're not afraid to lose your head

527
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,280
But the fish is innocent

528
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,000
I can't see her beheaded

529
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,880
Then you should have told me in advance

530
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,479
I can cooperate with you

531
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,800
How dangerous you are

532
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,280
You've already helped us

533
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,559
What did I help

534
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:58,319
Bury the fish in a mass grave

535
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,959
Ever since you were assassinated

536
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:00,920
I'll start investigating

537
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,959
That Cai's mother approached you on purpose

538
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,880
There is someone else behind her

539
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,680
Purpose

540
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,880
Is to put you in jail

541
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,640
Do you know who is behind the scenes now

542
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,559
Who the hell is it

543
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,920
Why didn't he just kill me

544
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,160
It's a great deal of trouble to attract you

545
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,479
If she knew that King Ning wanted to borrow her life experience,

546
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,319
Get rid of me

547
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,839
I'm afraid there will be a psychological burden

548
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,359
Besides, this matter also involves the family case

549
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,000
She is sure to take risks again

550
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,239
Let's just not tell her

551
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:30,680
It is not known yet

552
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,160
I was guessing

553
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,120
Xiao Rong Wang case

554
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,479
He Jia has the greatest income

555
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
It must be the Helanya layout that hurt me

556
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,120
But now it seems that

557
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:40,760
The punishments department is involved

558
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,400
The man behind it

559
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,400
It's by no means simple

560
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Anyway

561
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,680
Be sure to put this matter

562
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,199
Find out the truth

563
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,079
You want to keep working on this case, too

564
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,759
Also

565
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,759
Yeah

566
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,480
I found out before

567
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,559
There is something wrong with Chua's case

568
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
So I sent someone to check her life

569
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,759
Guess what

570
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,960
That Chua

571
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:03,039
It turned out to be Gu's surviving daughter

572
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:04,200
Gu Yi's nurse

573
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,799
Gu Jia is involved in Xiaorong Wang's case

574
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,960
So I decided to go to her hometown

575
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,799
Make a thorough investigation

576
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,799
Do you want to go to Cai's mother's hometown

577
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,200
You must find the real murderer if you want to clear the suspect

578
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,880
Now that Cai's mother is dead,

579
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,799
No clue

580
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:18,200
Maybe

581
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:20,279
Her hometown is a direction

582
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:23,559
Right, too

583
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,200
Maybe

584
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,120
You can also find clues to the people behind the scenes

585
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,120
Shen fish

586
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:30,319
Promise me

587
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,519
Whatever you have to do in the future

588
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,759
You have to tell me in advance

589
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Don't be impulsive

590
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,839
Don't act without permission

591
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,640
What you have to do

592
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,039
Let me do it for you

593
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,200
In this case

594
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
It is really necessary to take this trip

595
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,720
Then let's go find the fish first

596
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,720
Well, then

597
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,680
Tomorrow

598
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,759
We set out

599
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,200
Me, I'll go, too

600
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,799
Don't you want to go

601
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:03,400
I would like to go

602
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,400
But

603
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:05,640
Go far away

604
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,319
I didn't even bring any change of clothes

605
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,079
Buy

606
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,240
Then I usually have some

607
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
What is gold and silver soft

608
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
Take it with you

609
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,279
Buy

610
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,920
You know girls

611
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,079
And

612
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,319
There are still some

613
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,160
Buy it all

614
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:25,759
As long as it's what you like

615
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,120
Buy it all

616
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,960
Thank you

617
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,039
There's nothing else

618
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,880
It's just that if you go far away,

619
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,079
It stands to reason that it should be in person

620
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,319
Tell me about my husband's

621
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,240
A fish

622
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,880
Xianggong

623
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,640
You have prepared too well, haven't you

624
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,720
As a prince

625
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,319
You

626
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,720
Unexpectedly led troops out of the city without permission

627
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,200
King Ning

628
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
You know sin

629
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,999
The emperor calmed his anger

630
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,120
Ignorance of courtiers

631
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,440
I'm too anxious to share my worries for the emperor

632
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,319
Just believe people's words by mistake

633
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,319
Do something beyond the rules

634
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,240
Please ask the emperor

635
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:10,519
Never blame

636
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,079
Is overriding the moment

637
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,279
Or infidelity

638
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:18,720
Emperor

639
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,200
Where does the emperor learn

640
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,440
Heart of my brother

641
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:23,880
Heaven can be seen

642
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:25,359
Minister brother

643
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:26,920
Will never make

644
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,599
A violation of heaven

645
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,279
It's good that you know

646
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,480
You drink in the golden cup

647
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,079
White blade

648
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Do not forgive each other

649
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,319
Deliver to the Emperor

650
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:12,200
King Ning wants to play with me with Shen Yu's life

651
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,799
I'll let him lose the emperor's trust in him

652
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,079
That's true

653
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:18,440
The news that the little lady is alive now

654
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,680
He knows it well

655
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,240
But because there is no evidence,

656
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,960
I dare not expose it to the emperor

657
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,799
In this way,

658
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,440
At least the identity of Shen Yu can be kept secret for the time being

659
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,480
Buy her more time

660
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:30,999
How do I feel

661
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,160
You are interested in that wonderful person

662
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
Take great pains

663
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,039
What does it have to do with you

664
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,799
How are you getting ready for the trip

665
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,319
It's ready

666
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,400
But

667
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,279
Gao Mo and Zhou Yue will also go together

668
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,279
All right

669
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:46,880
It happens that I have something to do

670
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,559
I want to confirm with Gao Mo

671
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,240
Finally saved your little lady

672
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,440
Leave Beijing immediately

673
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,120
We can also be quiet for a while

674
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:02,920
Xianggong

675
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,799
What about Gao Mo

676
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,440
I went to buy dry food for the road

677
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,680
You said it was because of me

678
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,640
Not only did it bring trouble to His Royal Highness King Jing

679
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,680
And abducted two adults from the punishments department

680
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,799
What a sin I am

681
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,079
Little trouble

682
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,640
Your life is at stake

683
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:29,880
Work later

684
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
Remember to think before you leap

685
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,279
You

686
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,120
Still laughing

687
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,160
Yesterday

688
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,799
When I saw you buried in mass graves with my own eyes

689
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:41,559
Hands are shaking

690
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,880
Thinking about one thousand

691
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,359
There is one move to play chess in the temple

692
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,319
I'll never see it again

693
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:49,279
You have such a heartless smile

694
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,079
It worries you

695
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,759
Xianggong

696
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,120
Xianggong

697
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,999
When I was in jail

698
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,039
Sister-in-law Zhang said

699
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,519
Don't let anyone visit

700
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,759
How did you persuade Gao Mo to bring you in

701
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,160
I just

702
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:05,960
Please, please

703
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,559
You begged him

704
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,400
It's all my fault

705
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,120
You usually see him

706
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,880
Hide as you can, and avoid as you can

707
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,640
This time for my business

708
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,759
And bowed his head to him

709
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:25,839
No harm

710
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,960
When a gentleman is a gentleman, he is a gentleman

711
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,559
Bend down for your life

712
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:31,999
It's not hurtful

713
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:35,720
It's you

714
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,240
Since coming to Beijing with me,

715
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,999
There has never been a day of calm

716
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,400
I really feel bad about it in my heart

717
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,120
Xianggong

718
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,720
You are really a good man

719
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,880
Behind you

720
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,880
You won't say but, will you

721
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:57,759
What I'm trying to say is

722
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,839
You didn't get me into trouble

723
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,440
It's me

724
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,920
Drag you down

725
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,039
Have you packed your bags yet

726
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,599
Ready to go

727
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,039
Let's go

728
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:20,440
Let's go when we're done

729
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:23,720
Go

730
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,799
Father

731
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,120
What are you afraid of

732
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,480
The emperor didn't punish us either

733
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,480
Didn't you just read a poem

734
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:54,039
Wine comes first

735
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,920
The blade is behind

736
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:00,999
Don't you get it

737
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,319
The emperor is telling us that

738
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,279
Reward or kill

739
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,160
It's all between his thoughts

740
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,559
Between thoughts

741
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
This time

742
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,079
We are one game short

743
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,720
Has made the emperor suspicious

744
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Stop all actions

745
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:30,920
Bide your time

746
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:36,400
Qi Zhang, a villager in Shan Ye

747
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,599
I will never spare you

748
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,519
Shen fish

749
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:55,079
Isn't this carriage for you

750
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,079
Why sit down for me

751
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,720
Tall people go to great pains

752
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,079
To help me clear my name

753
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,559
Naturally, you can't be tired

754
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,440
I, I get carsick

755
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:06,559
A fish

756
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,279
You just survived a narrow escape and are weak

757
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,759
Why don't you take a carriage

758
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,480
Xianggong

759
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,319
Please, please

760
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,480
It's too boring in the carriage

761
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,839
Just let me ride a horse

762
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,359
But this weather

763
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:17,440
It's warm and cold at first

764
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,440
I'm afraid you'll catch cold

765
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,480
My identity

766
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
I'm afraid it's not very convenient

767
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,999
This weather is also quite strange

768
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,999
Why are you walking? It's so hot

769
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,079
Little Lady

770
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,839
Or you will suffer

771
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,400
Put on this shawl of mine

772
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,559
Why don't you give it to me

773
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,519
It's cold in my carriage

774
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,400
What's your name, son

775
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,920
Who are you

776
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:45,839
You will know later

777
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:48,240
I will be your master from today

778
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:51,880
You take my surname Shen single-character fish

779
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,559
I inquired about your family

780
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,680
I heard that they have just arrived in Yunnan

781
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,240
I happened to meet a mountain bandit who died or was taken away

782
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,680
But fortunately, among them

783
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,599
There is no news of your aunt and cousin

784
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:16,559
I'll ask someone to inquire again

785
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,359
It may not be that they escaped
