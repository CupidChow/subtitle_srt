1
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,159
There is no one in this world
K😊💕I😊S😊S😊K😊H

2
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,279
It's beyond my control

3
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,880
Ask the emperor

4
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,919
Rao Shen Yu never dies

5
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Rao Shen Yu never dies

6
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,559
Good

7
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,439
That

8
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,520
You promised me a condition

9
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,399
Shen fish

10
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,160
Zhou Family Woman

11
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,759
It is also a court criminal

12
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,399
I don't want you to get involved with her again

13
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,480
You are now old enough to choose a concubine

14
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,399
Zhou Yihui, the third lady of Zhou Hou Gongfu

15
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,039
Xiu Wai Hui Zhong

16
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,439
It's quite a match for you

17
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,679
I am determined

18
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,759
Marry you

19
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,079
Emperor

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,120
This is the only condition for me to release sunken fish

21
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,560
Think it over for yourself

22
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,920
Minister

23
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:06,800
Lead a decree

24
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,359
I implore the emperor to keep his promise

25
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,800
If I marry Zhou Yihui,

26
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,319
Let Shen Yu leave the punishments department unharmed

27
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,440
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China,

28
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,360
Always uphold the rule of law

29
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,239
Shen Yu, daughter of Shen Shi

30
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,959
Although it is involved in the old family case,

31
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,319
However, there is no conclusive evidence

32
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,799
Therefore, Shen Shi will be acquitted from today

33
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,759
You should

34
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,679
Appreciate the emperor's kindness and abide by his duty

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,519
Qin this

36
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,399
How did you burn them all

37
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,200
This is the only evidence that the family has overturned the verdict

38
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,039
This is a forgery of Ben Wang

39
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,679
False

40
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,399
What about the one the emperor destroyed

41
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,599
It's also fake

42
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,440
Dad

43
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,720
Everything is fine in Beijing

44
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,159
I have also saved some money in recent years

45
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,399
Wait a few more days

46
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,519
I will go back to Jizhou to pick you up and Feng Er

47
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,840
Our family can be reunited

48
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
It turned out to be just an ordinary letter from home

49
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,679
Father and child are unfilial

50
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,399
Greedy for money and eager for power to help He Guang

51
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,159
Replaced the owner Gu Survival

52
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,599
An antidote for Gao Guifei

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,799
Framing Gu Jiamanmen to jail

54
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,080
Rivers of blood

55
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,200
He Guang backed by Ning Wang and them

56
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,759
More than once, killers have been sent to try to kill them

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,039
Children can only hide in Tibet

58
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,440
Live for a while

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,159
To falsify evidence

60
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Owner, this is not your style

61
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,560
If it weren't for the trip to Jizhou, I got nothing

62
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,399
This king will not make such a bad decision

63
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:52,679
Originally thought

64
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,640
Even if this method doesn't work

65
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,120
It can be delayed for at least a while

66
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,840
I just didn't think of it

67
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,440
I didn't expect our emperor

68
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't care about any evidence at all

69
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,359
It doesn't matter the truth

70
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,160
That little lady over there

71
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you going to do

72
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,560
As long as she can live safely, it is enough

73
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,160
Wake up

74
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,760
I haven't slept in such a good bed for a long time

75
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,320
Xianggong

76
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,799
Come slowly

77
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,000
Why are you staring at me for so long

78
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,399
How

79
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,560
It won't be after the separation

80
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,479
Suddenly I found my goodness again

81
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,479
Regret it again

82
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
I just feel a little unreal

83
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,239
A few days ago

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm still thinking about whether you live or die

85
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,120
Be at a loss

86
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Now

87
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,679
I can't believe you came back intact

88
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:07,840
I can't believe you came back intact

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,199
This world has changed

90
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,679
It's unpredictable

91
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,919
Yeah, I wanted to ask you

92
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,560
What exactly do you use

93
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Save me from death

94
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,040
I am the emperor personally decree to behead ah

95
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,160
I'm not sure about this either

96
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,120
I only heard that King Jing is in the hall

97
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,359
Argue with the emperor

98
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,399
A good debate

99
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:33,359
But no one knows exactly what they said

100
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,959
Qi Zhang went to argue with the emperor for me

101
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:42,079
Are you crazy? He's dead

102
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,840
A fish

103
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,720
There are flowers that can be folded straight and must be folded

104
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Don't wait for no flowers

105
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,799
Empty folded branch

106
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,239
King Jing's deep affection for you

107
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,919
Even I can see it in my eyes

108
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
I have announced my peace with the Zhou family

109
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,079
You are free from now on

110
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,600
Don't live up to King Jing

111
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,679
Betray oneself

112
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,560
Do you understand

113
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,560
What are you doing

114
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
Are you crying or laughing

115
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,079
Handmaiden is so happy that she is going to cry

116
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,560
Can see the fifth grandmother

117
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,919
You came back alive and well

118
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,799
Handmaiden is really happy

119
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,320
It seems that the Bodhisattva really appeared

120
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
Bingzhan, you have to change your name in the future

121
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,720
She has now separated from the fifth young master

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,799
I have to change my name to Princess Jing in the future

123
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,720
What are you talking about? So straightforward

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,280
Isn't what the handmaiden said right

125
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,120
That's quite right

126
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,880
A Yue

127
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,320
A fish

128
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,799
The carriage is ready

129
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,919
Go find King Jing

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,160
You take this

131
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,639
Mark my words

132
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,840
Don't lose good times with each other in those days

133
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,440
Your Highness must have known that we would come

134
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,799
Specially open the door to meet

135
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,960
Do you think

136
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,599
I am so unladylike at ordinary times

137
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,679
Starting tomorrow

138
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,560
I specially invited a mammy

139
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,880
To teach me etiquette

140
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,880
I'll learn how to eat

141
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
How to walk

142
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,760
I will learn from tomorrow

143
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,560
You can rest assured that it won't embarrass you

144
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,159
No harm

145
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,400
You are the best now

146
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,200
I came here with a gift for you

147
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,719
Actually, Yue and I

148
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,159
It has always been only the name of husband and wife

149
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,039
She has the right person, so do I

150
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,960
We're just a fake couple

151
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,919
You know, right

152
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,640
I know

153
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,760
It's good to know

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
What are you trying to say

155
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,520
I want to say that people have to go through something

156
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,279
To understand other things

157
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,880
For example

158
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,479
For example

159
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
For example, A Yue said

160
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,880
Don't lose good times with each other in those days

161
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,799
There are flowers that can be folded straight and must be folded

162
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,479
I'm not Mrs. Zhou anymore

163
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,039
I broke up with you

164
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,839
I'm free

165
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,560
That King congratulates you

166
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,320
And then what

167
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,799
Now

168
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:31,080
You have nothing to do with this king's family

169
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,159
But if you encounter difficulties in the future,

170
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,719
You can still come to me

171
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,560
Future

172
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,719
What about now

173
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,640
Miss Shen has nowhere to go now

174
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,239
Ben Wang can bring you some silver

175
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,839
No repayment required

176
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,640
Qi Zhang, what are you doing

177
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,000
Why is this all of a sudden

178
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,839
You call this king's name taboo

179
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:06,679
Don't you think it's disrespectful

180
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,520
Isn't that what I keep calling you

181
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,760
What's the matter? This is

182
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,440
Is there someone watching Jing Wangfu?

183
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,479
Or is someone threatening you

184
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,400
If this king doesn't want to

185
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,679
Who can threaten me

186
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Then what the hell is going on

187
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,239
It was fine just now

188
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,359
Is it because of this and leaving the book

189
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,679
You think I didn't talk to you in advance

190
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,960
So you're mad at me, aren't you

191
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,080
I thought you'd be happy

192
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,839
So I didn't tell you in advance

193
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,880
If this is why you

194
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,960
Then I apologize to you

195
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,479
I did something wrong

196
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,200
What will happen to me in the future

197
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,679
Will discuss with you in advance

198
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,440
Would you please stop doing this

199
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,440
I know

200
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,400
This time to save me

201
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,200
You must have been wronged a lot

202
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,479
Suffer a lot of crimes

203
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,279
You have been paying for me all the time

204
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,760
There is an imbalance in your heart

205
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,320
I can understand all this

206
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:10,640
That

207
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,799
It's my turn in the future

208
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,279
You can tell me everything you have

209
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,839
You can give it to me

210
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,960
I promise I'll be honest

211
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,080
Don't get you into trouble

212
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,640
Can I pay for you in the future

213
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,200
You listen to Ben Wang

214
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,239
My King's House

215
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,039
It's impossible to let a person

216
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:45,080
And the daughter of the divorced sinner to do things

217
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,120
How do you look at me

218
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,400
Get it

219
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,479
Brother Qi Zhang

220
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,719
You're here

221
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,039
Brother Qi Zhang, why is she here

222
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,640
Why are you here to see Ben Wang

223
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,279
Woman in the house

224
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,359
Is helping me prepare the things I need for my marriage

225
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,200
I'll choose the red silk on the head cover

226
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,880
I don't know which one to pick

227
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,080
So I want to ask Qi Zhang's brother

228
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,719
Which one do you think is more suitable

229
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,159
You're the bride

230
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:27,960
You like it

231
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,400
You're getting married

232
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,919
You don't know

233
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:36,599
Right, too

234
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,479
You're in jail

235
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,120
With whom

236
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,359
Of course, it is with my brother Qi Zhang

237
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,080
In this world

238
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,640
I won't marry anyone but Qi Zhang's brother

239
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,359
Is what she said true

240
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,919
There is still a fake here

241
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,839
What I said is of course true

242
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,239
I didn't ask you

243
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,200
What she said

244
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Do you mean it

245
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,560
The fifth day of next month

246
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
If you are free

247
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,320
Miss Shen, if she wants to

248
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,679
You can come and drink our wedding banquet

249
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,599
No wonder from now on

250
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,959
Just satirize every sentence

251
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,040
I thought you were exhausted from running around

252
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,520
Lose your temper with me

253
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,719
I want to come now

254
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,520
The daughter of a sinner who has been separated from him

255
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,319
How dare you don't know the sky

256
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,640
Talk to His Royal Highness King Jing about the future

257
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,680
Want to come so much

258
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,839
It's really boring

259
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,800
If you have difficulties in the future,

260
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
You can come to me at any time

261
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:39,839
And

262
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,359
Don't touch the family case again

263
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,000
This will not bother Your Royal Highness King Jing

264
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,079
Today is the recklessness of the commoners

265
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,760
Disturb your highness's peace

266
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,239
Your Highness, rest assured

267
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,479
In the future, people must stay at a respectful distance from sb

268
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,719
Take a detour

269
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,239
May your highness

270
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
The breeze remains the same

271
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,920
Successful life

272
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,559
You're here

273
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,040
No one can hurt you with me around

274
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,800
Qi Zhang

275
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,439
Thank you

276
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,800
What do you say between you and me? Thank you

277
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,680
Do you really think

278
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,959
If you owe me a debt

279
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,359
Then you can give me a gift

280
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,280
Little blind man

281
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,760
The little blind man drank medicine

282
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,839
Don't move

283
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,160
Master said it would take seven days to uncover

284
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,599
Or you'll be blind

285
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,520
Who are you

286
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,839
Of course it's your savior

287
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,959
What does this smell like

288
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,640
Divine medicine

289
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
Take it away. Take it away

290
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,400
Don't throw up

291
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
It's sweet

292
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,239
If you eat my sugar, you have to accompany me to the market

293
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,040
Take my hand

294
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,079
Let's not get separated

295
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,280
What about saving your life

296
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,920
You don't say it's all about committing yourself

297
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,079
Don't hide

298
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:20,880
Presumptuous

299
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,959
It's despicable and vicious

300
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,239
You're pointing in the wrong direction

301
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:29,959
Drink it

302
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,400
No one can die

303
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,199
At most, it's like you

304
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,760
To be flat

305
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,040
Little blind man

306
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:39,599
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival

307
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,599
Master made hairy crabs and asked me to go back to eat them

308
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,520
I'll bring you two when I get back

309
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,839
Do wait for me

310
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm leaving

311
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,640
Don't go

312
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,120
Qi Zhang

313
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,079
A fish

314
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,439
I'm waiting for you from Mrs. Zhou

315
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Become Princess Jing

316
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,959
I believe you

317
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,680
I'm sorry

318
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,439
Emperor

319
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,359
Gao Guifei asked for an audience

320
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,559
What is she doing here

321
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,719
Said it was stewed tremella lotus seed soup for the emperor

322
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,959
Moisturize the lungs

323
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Let her in

324
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,640
The imperial concubine has always been in poor health

325
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,800
Don't handle this kind of thing yourself

326
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,400
It doesn't hurt to be a male and female servant

327
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,559
It's just that Yu'er has become more and more ill recently

328
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,439
My male and female servants watched him suffer from illness

329
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,959
Hate yourself and can't suffer for him

330
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
I hear

331
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,719
Recently, a new batch of people have entered the palace

332
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:05,239
Hundred years old ginseng is very good for health

333
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:09,479
I'll send someone back to Yu Er

334
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,959
Presumably the emperor knows better than his male and female servants

335
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,439
Yu'er's body

336
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,880
Not these precious tonic

337
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,199
It can be cured

338
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,239
Imperial concubine

339
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,520
When male and female servants and concubines were pregnant with Yu'er,

340
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,079
Be beaming red

341
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,479
Have a good complexion

342
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,359
Everyone has seen it

343
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,839
Everyone feels that the prince in the belly of male and female servants

344
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,120
It must be the dragon and phoenix among the strong and healthy people

345
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,880
But who would have thought

346
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,319
Yu'er now

347
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,400
It's been all these years

348
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:43,520
Why should you mention it

349
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,120
I heard that the old case was turned out again

350
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,199
Some people even say that

351
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,079
Gu Jia is not the murderer of Yu Er

352
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,760
As the mother of Yu'er, the emperor

353
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,439
Male and female servants always have the right to know the truth

354
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,520
Is that the family murdered the emperor's heir

355
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,400
This

356
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Is the truth

357
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,079
In this case

358
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,839
Why is the emperor so secretive

359
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,079
Do not investigate the matter thoroughly

360
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,040
Are you going to accuse me, too

361
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,839
Male and female servants dare not

362
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,400
It's getting late

363
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,120
Imperial concubine, go back and rest early

364
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,239
Total victory

365
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,239
Send the imperial concubine back to the palace

366
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:31,839
Yes

367
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,040
Imperial concubine, please

368
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,079
Imperial concubine empress

369
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,359
Please

370
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,319
Mother and Princess Don't Cry

371
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,199
This medicine is not bitter at all

372
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,680
Yu'er can drink it all

373
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,160
Silly child

374
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,959
How can medicine not be bitter

375
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,719
It's all my fault that my mother is too weak

376
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,599
To make you suffer so much

377
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,040
Yu'er rest assured

378
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,959
Mother Princess will definitely get justice for you

379
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,040
Come

380
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,959
The noble concubine has arrived

381
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:09,199
Aunt wants me to review the family file of the punishments department

382
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:13,599
But since I joined the punishments department,

383
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,120
The files of that year have been read

384
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,239
No less than ten times

385
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,520
I didn't find anything suspicious.

386
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,160
Don't just look at the surface

387
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,920
Sometimes truth is not necessarily true

388
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,640
False is not necessarily false

389
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,520
You mean

390
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,680
Some of these people are fake

391
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,520
Not without possibility

392
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,760
But this punishments file

393
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:44,040
Generally, they are copied from Zongren Mansion

394
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,599
I'll go back and discuss with Ayue

395
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:50,280
See how to bring up the file quickly

396
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,319
A Yue

397
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:54,000
Zhou Yue of Yongding Houfu

398
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,839
Yeah

399
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,559
He and I are now colleagues

400
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,800
Many cases are handled together

401
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
I didn't tell you

402
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,359
Do you want to keep your distance from the Zhou family

403
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,559
Why don't you listen

404
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,199
Aunt

405
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,719
I don't understand why every time

406
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,559
When you mention Zhou's family, you immediately turn black

407
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,680
Yue is very nice to him

408
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:12,680
Again

409
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,199
Last time you got sick in Jingwangfu

410
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,920
Or did his wife save you

411
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,880
Those are two different things

412
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:20,839
In short

413
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:23,239
You need to keep your distance from the Chow family, okay

414
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,040
I look at you

415
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,559
It's just too uncertain

416
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,760
Is it time to find someone to make a marriage

417
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
Take care of you

418
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,880
Aunt thinks

419
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,640
Helanya is good

420
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,359
What do you think

421
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,760
Helanya

422
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:42,880
No

423
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,199
No way

424
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,559
I don't care for her

425
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,599
What's more, I

426
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,400
Mo Er

427
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,959
The Gaos are not what they used to be

428
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,120
He Guang is attached to Ning Wang

429
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,920
If you marry Helanya,

430
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,520
We will have one more protection

431
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:57,239
Aunt

432
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,000
I will work hard in the future

433
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:01,680
Glorious lintel

434
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,239
But there's no way I could

435
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,319
I made a deal with my own lifelong events

436
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,760
Since ancient times

437
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,800
Which marriage is not to weigh the pros and cons

438
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,120
To put it mildly, it's called a perfect match

439
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,120
To put it bluntly

440
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,800
Isn't that a swap of interests

441
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,599
It's just asking for a difference

442
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Why not

443
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,800
I can't control others

444
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,120
I can only manage myself

445
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,199
You

446
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,239
The punishments department still has something to do. Mo Er has retired

447
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:29,479
Anyway, I've made up my mind. You can digest it yourself

448
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,520
Be quick with your hands and feet

449
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,479
Sweep it clean

450
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,479
Can you just post this position

451
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,800
I think a little higher

452
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,400
Hello, Miss

453
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,239
Hello, Miss

454
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:40,559
Be careful

455
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,359
Later, this one will be tied with a red lantern

456
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,280
OK

457
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,479
Put one in this one, too

458
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,800
Good

459
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,000
This piece should also be labeled with happy words

460
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,199
Yes, Miss

461
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,599
Miss, you won't get married until next month

462
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:01,400
Isn't it too early to hang up now

463
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,599
What do you know

464
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,439
I married Qi Zhang's brother

465
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,800
It is our Zhou family that has been in the past few years

466
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,000
The greatest happy event

467
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,400
Of course, it has to be prepared in advance

468
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,280
Which way do you want to go? You choose first

469
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,959
I'll pick the one you want

470
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,479
I'm tired and not in the mood to play with you

471
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,400
It's best for the two of us not to mess with each other

472
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,599
It doesn't matter. I wish I were in the mood

473
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,839
What do you want

474
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,680
It's nothing. You saw it all

475
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,280
My brother Qi Zhang and I will get married next month

476
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
What about you as my former sister-in-law

477
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,000
And the guests who live in my house for autumn wind now

478
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,880
Shouldn't it be said

479
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,719
I wish Miss San and your husband

480
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,800
Forever concentric for a hundred years

481
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,559
Qin Se He Ming gave birth to your son early

482
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,280
Is this all right

483
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:09,680
Can't

484
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,640
So you want to send me away

485
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,199
What else do you want

486
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,800
That day, you took the book and left to find Qi Zhang's brother

487
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,400
Do you really think

488
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
I don't know what you mean

489
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,559
Fortunately, Qi Zhang's brother only has me in his heart

490
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,959
You didn't exploit the loophole

491
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:22,640
Yes

492
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,839
You're the best. You're the best

493
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm overreaching, okay

494
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,359
So what gift are you going to give me

495
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,319
You said I was a guest of your family in the autumn wind

496
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,880
What can I have

497
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,160
Why do you want me to give you something

498
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,239
Because I want you to lose

499
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,839
Lose completely

500
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,760
Only you gave me a wedding gift

501
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,880
Let everyone see it

502
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,319
Especially for Qi Zhang's brother to see

503
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,120
I'm the real victory

504
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,079
Go ahead, what are you going to give me

505
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,680
Don't say you can't leave today

506
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,440
Shall I send you away

507
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,279
What are you going to do

508
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,400
I'll send you away right away

509
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,759
I thought you wanted me to give you something

510
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,480
You're crazy

511
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,400
I'll give you this

512
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:04,799
You crazy bitch

513
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,039
I'll send you straight away

514
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,839
How nice

515
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,720
I didn't eat a few days ago

516
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:46,200
Why is this overeating?

517
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,920
Why are you here today

518
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,559
Don't you need to go to the punishments department

519
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,120
I'm concerned about you

520
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,200
Take a special leave

521
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,480
It's a good thing I'm here

522
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,039
Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't eat my stomach

523
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Stop eating

524
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Bad is bad

525
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,279
Anyway, it's ash after death

526
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,319
That can't be tossed about like this

527
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,839
Get up and stop eating

528
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:15,599
I can't get up

529
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,319
Be obedient

530
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,319
I'll take you out for a break

531
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,400
Don't go

532
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,039
Then eat something delicious

533
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:24,680
Don't eat

534
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,960
What is missing

535
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,480
What do you like

536
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:29,880
Buy another one

537
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,480
Don't

538
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,440
Let's go

539
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,319
I have taken leave today

540
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,519
The salary was deducted in vain

541
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,759
Don't you love money the most

542
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,279
That's right. Look at you

543
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,120
A fish

544
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:00,799
I thought about it. I'm throwing caution to the wind today

545
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
Have a good time with you

546
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,160
You

547
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,240
Come on, come on

548
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,039
One more cup

549
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,079
Two guest officers

550
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,039
Food and drinks for all customers here today

551
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,160
I'll settle the bill

552
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,039
No

553
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,519
It's very expensive

554
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,319
As long as the fish is happy

555
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,880
It's worth whatever it takes

556
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,960
Serve wine

557
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,839
All right

558
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,880
Give the guest the best cold pool fragrance

559
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,440
No

560
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,559
Is to give everyone here cold pool incense

561
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,599
Good

562
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,279
Xiao Er serves wine

563
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:52,680
Come

564
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,200
Gold is empty and silver is empty

565
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,640
Have you ever been in your hands after death

566
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,240
Love is empty and hate is empty

567
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,720
Strangers in life do not meet each other

568
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:07,759
A fish

569
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:13,599
A Yue

570
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,279
You said we used to

571
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,279
Clearly so good

572
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,880
Why on earth

573
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,960
Will come to this field today

574
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,279
What the hell did I do wrong

575
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,319
He's gonna hate me so much

576
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,559
A fish

577
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,440
Fate is like this

578
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,559
Unpredictable change

579
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:37,960
No one can help

580
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,799
My whole life

581
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,999
I have Ayue by my side

582
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:58,400
It is already worthwhile to live this life

583
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,400
A Yue, I propose a toast to you

584
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,559
To our past husband and wife

585
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,120
To the present

586
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,799
Our bosom friend's meaning

587
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:09,920
A fish

588
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,640
There will be a place for me in Zhou Yue in the future

589
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:14,839
Is your home

590
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,720
Our days will be taken in the future

591
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,160
Drink according to the wine

592
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,120
Days have passed and wine has been drunk

593
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,440
Since I separated from my little lady,

594
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,759
How many hours do you stand here every day

595
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,359
Why bother

596
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:59,319
The spy just came back and reported that

597
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,559
Say little lady she

598
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:07,720
What's wrong with her

599
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,720
Said she and Zhou Yue packed the Forget Worry Restaurant

600
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,680
Drink with several people

601
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,400
Thank you for today's Hantan fragrance

602
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,999
Thank him. It's his treat

603
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,720
Drink

604
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,999
Come and fill it for you

605
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,120
How about it? Come on, I'll fill it up for you

606
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,680
Drink

607
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,039
Go

608
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,200
We drink by ourselves

609
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,160
Listen to me, everybody

610
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,680
Let me say a few words

611
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,359
Everybody

612
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:49,480
Let people who are not worth it

613
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,559
Let unhappy things

614
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,839
All disappear

615
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,400
Vanish

616
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,839
There is wine now and drunk now

617
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,960
Tomorrow's sorrow comes tomorrow's sorrow

618
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,120
Drink

619
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:09,440
Pour wine

620
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,319
This guest officer

621
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,120
Let them all go out

622
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:20,720
Understand

623
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,720
Dear Guest Officers, Dear Guest Officers

624
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,839
Put it down and share the silver with me in the backyard

625
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,759
Quick, quick, quick

626
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,759
Come on, come on

627
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,680
Divide the silver

628
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:36,640
I don't know what to repay you with

629
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,680
And then

630
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,519
I don't have anything of value either

631
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,039
I see

632
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:52,400
I'll give you one of my kisses

633
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,240
King of Scenery

634
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,200
You come with me

635
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,359
A Yue

636
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:06,319
You

637
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,759
You slow down

638
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:11,640
I thought you wanted to see him

639
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,480
You let go

640
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,999
As a woman, she drinks alcohol during the day

641
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:34,599
Alcoholism hurts one's health

642
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:36,039
How bad

643
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,279
I have long lost that affection with your highness

644
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,440
It's not your turn to take care of me

645
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:45,999
Even if you have no chance to play the piano and harp,

646
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,680
As a friend

647
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,359
I don't want to see you fall so depraved either

648
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,039
Friend

649
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,640
Your Highness thought it was now

650
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,400
We can still be friends calmly

651
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,720
These days

652
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:01,640
May be in your highness's heart

653
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,079
It's just a spectacle

654
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,279
But it's different in my heart

655
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:08,640
I've been wanting to ask you

656
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,319
What we've been through

657
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,440
What is it in your heart

658
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,759
I was set up

659
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,440
It's true that you risked going to the mass grave to save me

660
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,120
I'm in prison again

661
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:23,480
You disobeyed the holy order

662
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,079
It's also true that you saved me and found evidence

663
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,160
I often get in distress along the way

664
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,960
It's true that you protect me with your own body

665
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,759
But now you are married to Zhou Yihui

666
00:44:31,759 --> 00:44:32,720
It's also true

667
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,200
Then you tell me

668
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:40,480
What is fake

669
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,599
Qi Zhang

670
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:54,440
In the utmost optimism

671
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,839
Those promises you made to me

672
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,279
Is it love to the depths

673
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:04,359
Or is it just a whim

674
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,039
Do you really think this king

675
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,759
He is a person who delivers his heart at will

676
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,839
Then tell me why

677
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,839
Why did you marry someone else

678
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:35,839
You have a reason, don't you

679
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,759
You have something to hide, don't you

680
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:42,039
I thought about it

I've thought of countless possibilities

687
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,039
Shall we face it together
