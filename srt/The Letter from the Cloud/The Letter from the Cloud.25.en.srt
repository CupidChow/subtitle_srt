1
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,081
You wait here for me

2
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,921
I'll go back to the punishments department and assemble my men

3
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,160
Set up checkpoints after they leave the city

4
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,841
Catch them

5
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,081
High ink

6
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,320
No

7
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:00,760
If Helanya runs away at this time,

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,041
It's too hard to catch it again

9
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,720
I just took over the He family

10
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,440
If you leave like this,

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,841
From then on, there will be no future

12
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,481
Turn around

13
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:24,240
OK

14
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:30,521
Keep up

15
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,161
What do you do

16
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,080
Find death

17
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,641
Miss He went and returned

18
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:45,720
So-called what

19
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
Zhou Yue

20
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,201
Don't look at it

21
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,241
It's just me

22
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,440
I was just looking for you

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,561
You delivered it to your door by yourself

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Zhou Yue

25
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,521
What are you doing here alone

26
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,201
Arrest me

27
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,201
Yi Hui can't die in vain

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,481
King Jing can't be wronged innocently

29
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,161
You killed the man

30
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:32,360
You should be brought to justice

31
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,720
Overreach

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,841
Kill her for me

33
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,801
Don't move. I'll kill you

34
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:39,720
Zhou Yue

35
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,281
I can't believe you can use a knife

36
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,521
Dealing with people like you

37
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,201
A Yu's method is the most effective

38
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,720
Needless to say

39
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,801
Tell them to back off

40
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,121
Backward

41
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,000
You all back off

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,760
Zhou Zhou Yue

43
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,160
Don't get excited

44
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,281
I

45
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,441
Helanya

46
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,001
Although I have the heart to kill you,

47
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,481
But you broke the law

48
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,081
There is a law to judge you

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,760
You come back to the punishments department with me now

50
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,960
I won't hurt you

51
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:07,121
Good

52
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:07,921
Good

53
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:09,841
Zhou Yue

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,361
In fact, I have long wanted to fall into the law

55
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,841
I grew up with Yi Hui since childhood

56
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:15,841
How could I want to kill her

57
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:16,880
I didn't want to kill her

58
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:18,880
It's all made me by Qi Lian

59
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,921
He forced me to

60
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:23,320
Kill her for me

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,201
Are you all right

62
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,281
I'm okay

63
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:37,800
Can't let her go

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,641
High ink

65
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:43,960
You can't arrest me

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,081
You care so much about her

67
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:49,441
I don't want her to be put to death.

68
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,561
What do you mean

69
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,800
You let me go

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,320
I will never return to Beijing again

71
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,520
And Zhou Yue's secret

72
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,760
And no one will ever know

73
00:04:59,201 --> 00:04:59,561
Can't

74
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,240
High ink

75
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:01,441
You can't let her go

76
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,201
Can't promise her

77
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,600
But Yue

78
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,281
If she does go to jail

79
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,320
You can't hide your affairs

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,600
That can't let her go either

81
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:16,121
She killed Yi Hui

82
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:17,040
Hurt King Jing

83
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:19,841
His father framed Ah Yu's family to die innocently

84
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,320
She must stand trial

85
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,960
High ink

86
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:25,081
The dead are gone

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,760
Living is the most important thing

88
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,921
You like her so much

89
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,481
If she is put to death because she is guilty,

90
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,281
Don't you regret it

91
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,320
High ink

92
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,921
Don't listen to her

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,561
You let me go

94
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,160
You can feel at ease together

95
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,641
Go

96
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,761
Never come back

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Can't go

98
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
Everybody hear me clearly

99
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm Zhou Yue, the punishments doctor

100
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,121
Yongding Houfu Five Young Master

101
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,321
I'm not a man

102
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:24,321
It's a fake girl

103
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,400
Zhou Yue

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
You concealed your identity and entered the DPRK as an official

105
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,960
Deceive the saints and waste the people all over the world

106
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,281
Sin should be punished

107
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll see how you end up

108
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,441
Take away

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,680
I didn't dare go too far

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,080
Pick some fruit at random

111
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,920
Make do with it

112
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:22,761
Thank you very much

113
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:31,601
What are you thinking

114
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,601
Miss my mother princess

115
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:38,640
Don't worry

116
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,281
The emperor is infatuated with your mother

117
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:42,240
It won't embarrass her

118
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
You'd better think about how you get out of it first

119
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:47,920
Yeah, too

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm just a civilian now

121
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:51,721
Without soldiers and no rights

122
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,400
And what can be done

123
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
Man lives all his life

124
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Who doesn't have three disasters and eight disasters

125
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
You are the Lord of the Northwest

126
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,561
It is necessary to have more endurance than ordinary people

127
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:04,161
Who else would you let the people count on

128
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:06,761
You are quite comforting

129
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,360
No matter what the situation is,

130
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:09,960
They all have a broad-based mentality

131
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:13,520
That's because I firmly believe

132
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,601
Someday God will give me the best

133
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
So you think

134
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,881
What should we do now

135
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:22,920
You ask me

136
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,240
Can't you help yourself

137
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,200
No

138
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Weak supervision by micro-ministers

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,480
Be deceived by Zhou Yue

140
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,041
I didn't know she was a daughter

141
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,601
Please forgive me

142
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:36,960
Absurd

143
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:38,640
This Zhou Yue

144
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,721
Dare to cheat me

145
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,321
Simply regard the law of the country as nothing

146
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,960
Pass a decree

147
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,800
Zhou Yue deceives you and ignores you

148
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,321
Arrest and bring to justice immediately

149
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,240
Chop after three days

150
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,080
Yes

151
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,561
Zhou Yue, the fifth son of Yongding Houfu

152
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
Dare to dress up as a man and enter the DPRK as an official

153
00:09:58,601 --> 00:09:59,960
Deceive the monarch and disregard the superior

154
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:09,761
Zhou Yue criminals deceive the monarch

155
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Be willing to submit to the law

156
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Take down

157
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,680
Stop

158
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,040
I am Yongding Houfu

159
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,480
It is the place given by the first emperor

160
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,521
Even if you commit a felony,

161
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,441
I can't tolerate you humiliating like this

162
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,961
Grandmother

163
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:43,961
A Yue

164
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:49,761
All the troubles are caused by grandmother

165
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,441
You shouldn't bear it

166
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:54,480
Grandmother

167
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,081
A Yue is indeed unforgivable

168
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
I do things by myself and do them by myself

169
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,401
This is what I should have faced a long time ago

170
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,600
A Yue

171
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,001
Excuse me, everyone. Just a moment

172
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,160
Grandmother

173
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,480
Although we have been fighting for many years,

174
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,720
But in Ayue's heart,

175
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:25,441
Go to the room

176
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:28,321
Always be the pillar of my Zhou family

177
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:30,881
Grandmother

178
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,881
And it will always be the one

179
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,321
Loving relatives who feed Ayue sugar

180
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:39,280
A Yue

181
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,201
Grandmother

182
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,321
Ayue knows that grandmother likes purity

183
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,001
Therefore, a Linshan courtyard in the suburbs of Beijing was put early

184
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
It fell under the grandmother's name

185
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:03,280
I hope my grandmother can enjoy peace and quiet

186
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,961
Take care of one's life

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,081
Aunt

188
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,201
A Yue heard

189
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:16,600
Your two nephews in your hometown are good at doing business

190
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:21,280
These two shops in Beijing were given to my aunt

191
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,321
I hope the two brothers

192
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,881
Can always accompany my aunt

193
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,521
Instead of the responsibility of going around the knees according to Huixing

194
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,720
This

195
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,160
Goro

196
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,121
This is the whole net worth of the three rooms

197
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,401
Give it to grandmother today

198
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:56,201
May my Zhou family be United with one heart and one mind from now on

199
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:58,800
Peace and stability

200
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,761
Granddaughter Zhou Yue

201
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,201
Say goodbye here

202
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,360
A fish

203
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,201
My trip was too dangerous

204
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,441
Never bring trouble to you

205
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,720
Where are you going

206
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:55,201
I

207
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,160
Go and collect some firewood

208
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,720
These are not enough for you

209
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,040
You have to pick it up

210
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,121
I don't want to hide anymore

211
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,040
Why

212
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,280
It's safe

213
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:14,081
Because of this

214
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,001
So I can't keep hiding anymore

215
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,480
Now

216
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,121
Although I am only a civilian,

217
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,160
But at least it is also the blood of my royal family

218
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,401
Can you be like those little ones

219
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,441
Hide the head and hide the tail

220
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,881
So what do you want

221
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,600
What have you come up with

222
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,840
How can there be a perfect solution now

223
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:32,720
But didn't you say so

224
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,160
There are thousands of Qian Qian people waiting for me in Yongzhou

225
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,401
I just want to give them an explanation

226
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,761
Can you stop acting like a prince

227
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,800
It's better to live than to die

228
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,240
The most important thing now is to save your life, you know

229
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:45,321
You're right

230
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,401
Saving your life is the most important thing now

231
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:53,401
So from now on

232
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:55,360
You're no longer my spy

233
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
Say goodbye here

234
00:14:59,001 --> 00:14:59,600
Take care

235
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,201
Qi Zhang

236
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:06,280
A fish

237
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:11,800
You

238
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:49,920
A Yue

239
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,441
In front of me

240
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:05,961
You can cry if you want to

241
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,401
Laugh whenever you want

242
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,001
High ink

243
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,600
I didn't mean to lie to you

244
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,201
I'm sorry

245
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:27,201
I know

246
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,401
The prison is wet and cold

247
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,081
You have suffered

248
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,641
Nothing

249
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,121
I'm here

250
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,441
On the contrary, I can figure out a lot of things

251
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:45,321
Once upon a time

252
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,201
I carry such a burden

253
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:50,561
Be nervous all day long

254
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:53,920
Now

255
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,720
But I can eat well and sleep well

256
00:16:58,441 --> 00:17:00,160
My heart is very down-to-earth

257
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
I'm useless

258
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,001
What does it have to do with you

259
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,480
High ink

260
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:11,840
What's wrong with you

261
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,641
Is there something wrong with my Zhou family

262
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,521
I still got into trouble with the Zhou family, didn't I

263
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,561
High ink

264
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,480
If I have something to do

265
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:27,321
Please be sure to keep my family safe

266
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,081
I can't say it, can I

267
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,720
How many days have you been my subordinate?

268
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,401
I'll tell you myself

269
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,441
You bully you

270
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,240
The emperor ordered

271
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,480
You will be beheaded in three days

272
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:48,441
If there is anything else, just say it quickly

273
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,881
As long as my Zhou family is fine

274
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,720
I die without regret

275
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:12,881
You can rest assured

276
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,121
I will never let you die

277
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,720
Wait for me

278
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:24,641
High ink

279
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,441
High ink

280
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,881
Wei Chen Gao Mo See See at Emperor

281
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,121
Long live the emperor, long live

282
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,401
Flat body

283
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:09,921
High ink

284
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,560
I know why you came here

285
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,480
It's just that Zhou Yue bullied you

286
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,161
Law is unforgivable

287
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,161
So

288
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:21,881
You don't have to say much

289
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,401
Can the emperor listen to the micro-minister

290
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,161
Micro-ministers chisel is interceding for Zhou Yue

291
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,240
But there is another thing that Wei Chen wants to resign

292
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,161
Resign one's post

293
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,360
Exactly

294
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,200
High ink

295
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,200
Enter the DPRK as an official

296
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,881
Be loyal to the king

297
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,200
Save the suffering of the people

298
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,560
No

299
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:47,440
Your dream all along

300
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:49,840
Yes

301
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,881
This is Wei Chen

302
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,960
Once a wish and ambition

303
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:56,641
But now

304
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,240
Zhou Jiawulang deceives you and commits crimes

305
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,200
And Weichen has already known

306
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,401
I didn't report my knowledge

307
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,801
Also wholeheartedly sheltering

308
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,001
Minister

309
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,401
No longer have the face to share your worries

310
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,001
Plead for the people

311
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,560
I only hope that the holy man

312
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,161
Allow micro-ministers to share the blame

313
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:21,440
Be lenient to Zhou Yue and Zhou Jia

314
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,080
I implore the grace of the Holy Grace

315
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:27,881
You

316
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,761
Can think clearly

317
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,921
Knock on the Holy Grace

318
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:39,080
I

319
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,281
Accurate

320
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:43,720
Wei Chen thanked Zhu Long En

321
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:24,521
Shen fish

322
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:25,720
You

323
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,320
You put me down

324
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:28,761
What are you doing

325
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:30,600
You are really too heavy

326
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,801
I'm too tired to talk to you now

327
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,960
The acupoints of your hands and feet are sealed by me

328
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,801
Don't waste your energy

329
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,440
You get me up first

330
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,921
I'll give you an analysis of the stakes

331
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,121
When we get to the village in front,

332
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:52,401
I'll find a carriage to get us out of here

333
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:55,480
From then on, the mountains are high and the waters are far away

334
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,200
We're never coming back

335
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,881
So don't you reverse your conviction

336
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,761
What about the family

337
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,801
He's your father

338
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I can't do it

339
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,840
Qi Zhang is still missing

340
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,360
What do you have in mind

341
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:31,600
Father

342
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,200
We don't know

343
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:34,801
But there is one person

344
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,480
It will definitely help us find Qi Zhang

345
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:47,960
My adult is not well

346
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,921
Message came from the punishments department

347
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,161
Lord Zhou was executed in advance

348
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,521
This will have been taken to the execution ground

349
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,281
What

350
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,641
The hour has come

351
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:08,960
Chop

352
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,080
A Yue

353
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:05,681
A Yue

354
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,041
What it's like to lose someone you love

355
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,320
Does it hurt into the liver and intestines

356
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,641
I'll kill you

357
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,240
Kill me

358
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,840
Zhou Yuecai will really die

359
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,161
What do you mean

360
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,960
This is just another death row prisoner

361
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,560
What

362
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,161
What the hell do you want

363
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:39,641
I just want to talk to tall people

364
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,681
It's just a deal

365
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:45,281
You want me to help you find Qi Zhang

366
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,921
I have no idea where he is

367
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:49,440
Of course you don't

368
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,560
But Shen Yu and Zhou Yue are so close

369
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,521
They must still have contact

370
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,200
As long as you help me find Qi Zhang

371
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,600
Let me kill him

372
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:01,641
I keep you beautiful in my arms

373
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,360
No

374
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:05,720
Ayue has a strong character

375
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,600
If she knows that I sold friends to save her

376
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,681
She will never forgive me

377
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,521
Lao Jing Wang poisoned Xiao Rong Wang

378
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:14,240
Let your Gaos fall here

379
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,560
Qi Zhang, is he still your friend

380
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,960
Zhou Yue is already a capital crime

381
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:23,921
What ability do you have to save her

382
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,801
It's just like just now

383
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,320
It's just powerless to face a pool of blood

384
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,480
Tall man

385
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,560
Even if you get away with saving Zhou Yue,

386
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
You want to look at the one you love

387
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:46,121
Have you been running away with you all your life

388
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:48,121
Would you

389
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,761
I'm afraid Zhou Yue won't

390
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:55,240
I've already said everything I need to say

391
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,440
Is Zhou Yue alive or dead

392
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,521
It's all in your hands

393
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,001
You are a wise man

394
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
Know how to choose

395
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,921
But I also want to remind you that

396
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:09,360
Don't think too long

397
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,281
The prince has no patience

398
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,200
High ink

399
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:08,360
Thank you

400
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
You shouldn't thank me

401
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,200
Why shouldn't I thank you

402
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:18,960
I know

403
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:20,921
You did it for me and the Chow family

404
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:22,480
Quit all the officials

405
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:30,001
Anyway

406
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,320
This time

407
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:33,041
I owe you

408
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,720
There's nothing to owe

409
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:41,041
Live well

410
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:49,761
The slave really didn't expect it

411
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:53,401
This Ning Wang will intercede for Zhou Yue

412
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,440
Where is he pleading

413
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,881
He is clearly forcing me to release people

414
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,681
Ning Wang is not to protect the Zhou family

415
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,440
But to use this matter to lead to King Jing and Shen Shi

416
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,161
Emperor

417
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,921
You have to plan ahead

418
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:32,720
This wax has been burning all night

419
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:34,681
The snuff burst

420
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,720
Either the old slave will change one for you

421
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:39,960
Don't change it

422
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:47,921
It's dawn

423
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:49,281
Dad

424
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,560
You pleaded for Zhou Yue today

425
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,881
It's too tough on the emperor, isn't it

426
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,521
The emperor is a little annoyed

427
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,320
This Qi Zhang

428
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,161
Although it has been distributed,

429
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,681
But he is cunning by nature

430
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,681
We

431
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:06,840
He must not be given any respite

432
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:09,440
What my father said is exactly what my son thought

433
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Now Qi Zhang has been sent by the cutting clan

434
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:13,320
The emperor is also very ill

435
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,041
Courtiers all think that my brother Qi Mao

436
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,001
Be the best candidate for Chu Jun

437
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:20,320
We must pursue the victory

438
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:29,560
This wind has been blowing for too long

439
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,041
At this time

440
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,840
It's time for a change of weather

441
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,521
A fish

442
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,320
You and King Jing must be safe and sound

443
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:22,641
Qi Zhang

444
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,320
You tied me up while I was asleep. You're mean

445
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,681
What other means do you care about binding people

446
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,080
Only hypocrites care about form

447
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:34,001
Why does this sound so familiar

448
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:35,921
Qi Zhang, you put me down

449
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,121
There is danger everywhere outside here

450
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,080
You still have to go out. Aren't you dead set on it

451
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:40,480
Ning Wang Wolf Ambition

452
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:42,761
If everyone is afraid of danger

453
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,480
How peaceful is the home country

454
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,200
You have to go back to deal with King Ning

455
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:47,681
I didn't think about who to deal with

456
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:48,440
It's just a big start

457
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,240
Can't be handed over to a

458
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,521
The hand of a frenzied person

459
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,881
It's Ayue

460
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,600
How do you know

461
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,840
This whistle is what I left her. It can carry sound for hundreds of miles

462
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:05,161
There is such a thing

463
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
You left Ayue and won't give me one

464
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:09,161
Of course I will give it to Ayue

465
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,600
She's my sworn sister. I

466
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:13,840
No

467
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
What I mean is

468
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:15,641
All right

469
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,480
Zhou Jiawulang is a daughter

470
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,320
I already knew

471
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
You knew that

472
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,281
So you've been playing me

473
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:23,840
Come on, Yue, look for me

474
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,801
You put me down quickly

475
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm afraid there is fraud in this

476
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,080
What fraud can there be

477
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
What if Ayue is in danger

478
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,720
You let it go for me

479
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
The whistle is gone

480
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,080
Five Girls

481
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,521
Have you seen the tall man

482
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:50,080
What did you say Gao Mo was here

483
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,840
Right

484
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,080
I was here at noon today. Didn't you see it

485
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:54,440
High ink

486
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,881
The whistle came from around here

487
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,121
Why doesn't Yue come yet

488
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,320
Sounding the flute is really fraudulent

489
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:21,681
Thanks to the blessings of tall people

490
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,600
Small world, isn't it

491
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,521
His Royal Highness King Jing

492
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:27,080
High ink

493
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:29,281
You betrayed us

494
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,121
Your Highness

495
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:34,960
A fish

496
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:36,401
I'm sorry

497
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:41,200
Sickle

498
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:45,080
You can withdraw your dark guard from Zhou Fu, right

499
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:46,720
Tall man

500
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:48,840
Don't be in such a hurry

501
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,720
You have to kill them

502
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,121
Zhou Yuecai will not die

503
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,161
A Yue

504
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:57,720
What happened to Ayue

505
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,121
You reneged on your word

506
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,681
I reneged on my word

507
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,801
You're in deep trouble

508
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,320
Now I'd like to leave it clean

509
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:08,881
I'm afraid it's a little late

510
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:10,641
You and Zhou Yue

511
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,041
Do you want to be a long-term husband and wife

512
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,041
Or a short-lived mandarin duck

513
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:16,320
You choose for yourself

514
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,041
Go and kill them

515
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:25,121
If you don't do it again

516
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,720
Zhou Yue will die

517
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:33,521
High ink

518
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:34,960
What do you want to do

519
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:47,281
High ink

520
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,121
What happened to Ayue

521
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,001
Go quickly

522
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:51,521
Shoot an arrow

523
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:28,001
Are you dead

524
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,121
Live to see people die to see corpses

525
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:38,641
Search for me

526
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:40,001
Yes

527
00:34:57,881 --> 00:34:58,600
Are you all right

528
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,281
It seems that usually

529
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,840
It is useful to do more good deeds

530
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,001
To the critical moment

531
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:09,281
These flowers and plants are saving lives

532
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:10,720
It was Gao Mo who saved us

533
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,761
High ink

534
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,521
You said he kicked us down on purpose

535
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:16,200
If he hadn't shot in time

536
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,521
We would have died under the random arrows of the sickle

537
00:35:18,881 --> 00:35:20,681
He also brought Qi Lian

538
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,641
He's a traitor anyway

539
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,600
But

540
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:26,720
My whistle for Ayue

541
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,960
Why would he have it

542
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,360
I'm afraid there is another secret in this

543
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,881
Hold me tight. Let's go down first

544
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:33,360
Good

545
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,641
Is your arm all right

546
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,840
No hindrance

547
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:46,200
King Ning really regards you as a thorn in his side

548
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,560
You're already in exile

549
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,521
He is still chasing after him

550
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,320
Kill you to death

551
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,641
Let's go back now

552
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,840
Isn't that a rush to die in the world

553
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,481
Until the end

554
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:55,560
It is not certain who will die

555
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,921
What do you mean

556
00:35:57,881 --> 00:35:58,881
You have a plan again

557
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,481
You still keep it from me

558
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:03,921
You should have known

559
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,481
You followed a dangerous man

560
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,161
Let's go

561
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,201
Why did you take the whistle

562
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,441
I'm sorry

563
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,600
I made a deal with Qi Lian

564
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You use me as a bargaining chip

565
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,241
I really can't help it

566
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,800
How are Ah Yu and King Jing

567
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,840
I believe that they have their own lucky people

568
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,280
Will come back safely

569
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:40,481
If anything happens to them,

570
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,040
I will never forgive you

571
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:45,520
I won't forgive myself either

572
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,201
A Yue

573
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:02,080
A fish

574
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,000
A Yue

575
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:11,800
It's really good that you're okay

576
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,360
Didn't we say it when we became sworn

577
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,000
Work together in this life

578
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,441
Support each other and never give up on life and death

579
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,441
How could I leave you alone

580
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,840
What the hell happened

581
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:27,681
Events

582
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,360
You come with me. I'll talk to you slowly

583
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,840
Be careful

584
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,760
High ink

585
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,121
Occipital cloud

586
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,280
His Royal Highness King Jing

587
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,560
Tall man

588
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,921
That kick of yours

589
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,280
It really hurt Ben Wang for several days

590
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,000
Gao Mo is helpless

591
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Please punish your highness

592
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,881
It doesn't hurt

593
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,040
To save Zhou Yue

594
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:11,161
I can understand

595
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,481
How's the fish

596
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,600
She's fine

597
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:14,921
High ink

598
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,241
Ben Wang wants you to do me another favor

599
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,441
But it doesn't hurt to say

600
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:28,721
Yu Er

601
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,401
Brother

602
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:32,800
Yu'er, you are well

603
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:33,921
Has been cured

604
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,481
Ben Wang asked you for help

605
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,161
Is to ensure the safety of Yu'er

606
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
Please rest assured that King Jing

607
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,441
It's yours

608
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,721
Let's go

609
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:51,481
The prince didn't find any bodies

610
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:52,441
Fuck off

611
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,320
Yes

612
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,800
Dad

613
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:00,360
It's not good

614
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,201
What's the matter

615
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,080
Xiao Rong Wang is well

616
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
A carriage enters the city

617
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,481
It has been taken into the palace now

618
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:07,961
What

619
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,161
Father

620
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,641
Didn't the emperor tell you

621
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,641
Xiao Rong Wang is dying soon

622
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,481
Send him out of the palace

623
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,600
But is it just to reassure Gao Guifei

624
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,080
Turns out he's been lying to me

625
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,320
He lied to me

626
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,560
Dad

627
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,040
Then our efforts

628
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,080
Wouldn't it be in vain

629
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,681
Xiao Rong Wang

630
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,520
It's just a yellow-mouthed child

631
00:39:41,401 --> 00:40:43,121
Not enough to be afraid

632
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,721
Qi Zhang is dead

633
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:54,641
The throne

634
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:05,320
Or is it in the bag of King Ning

635
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,641
Father

636
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:08,641
Now all the captains

637
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,000
Has contacted and assembled

638
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:12,040
The soldiers and horses of the patrol battalion

639
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:14,161
Most of them are in our hands

640
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,320
Just waiting for my father's order

641
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:20,320
Inform all the people

642
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:21,760
Close to the Imperial City

643
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:22,681
Yes

644
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:43,921
Newspaper

645
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:45,840
Newspaper

646
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,080
Report to the Emperor

647
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,000
King Ning

648
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:49,360
Inverted

649
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:08,520
Emperor

650
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:10,961
Watching King Ning attack outside the temple

651
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:11,560
Or

652
00:41:12,441 --> 00:41:13,481
You move quickly

653
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:14,921
I'm not leaving

654
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,560
I

655
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,000
It is the monarch of Daqi

656
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,721
When and where

657
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,080
Regal does not move

658
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:25,520
I'll take a look

659
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:28,000
He is full of respect and forgiveness

660
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:31,360
How to disobey my brother

661
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,481
How to rebel against the monarch

662
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,040
Brother Emperor

663
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,161
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China,

664
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,401
This throne is all the Almighty

665
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:34,121
Look at you like this now

666
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,881
Old and sick

667
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:38,721
It's time

668
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:40,560
Abdicate the throne

669
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:43,000
Besides

670
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,681
In your present state

671
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,000
Let the western border know

672
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,441
It is bound to cause disaster and war

673
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,201
Qi Zunshu

674
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,401
You

675
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:56,760
This is a blatant rebellion

676
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,520
Right

677
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,360
I'm just going to turn against you

678
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:02,681
You used us

679
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,401
Give your own son a stepping stone to the throne

680
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:06,760
Today

681
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:08,881
I'll let you taste it, too

682
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,121
Be subject to people's taste

683
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,721
Brother Emperor

684
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:18,241
That position

685
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,441
You've been sitting too long

686
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:23,800
Rest

687
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,641
All the soldiers listen to orders

688
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,441
Please emigrate the emperor

689
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,721
Yes
