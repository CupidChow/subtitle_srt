1
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,319
Unexpectedly

2
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,760
So smoothly, I became a female palm

3
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,720
It will be much more convenient to enter the criminal department to contact the pulse case in the future

4
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,279
What are you doing

5
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,439
What a coincidence for the owner

6
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,040
Why do you want to hide from this king

7
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,639
Why don't you give me a little more time

8
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,959
I took your money

9
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,439
But infiltrating into the upper room

10
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,319
It's really not that easy

11
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,520
That's not what Ben wants to tell you

12
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,759
I didn't say this. You said it earlier

13
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,000
What do you want from me

14
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,400
Why do you want to go to the punishments department as a female palm

15
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,679
Make money

16
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:48,640
Make money

17
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,359
You take the Zhou family's monthly money

18
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,880
And the reward Ben Wang gave you

19
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,799
Will care about the salary of the punishments department

20
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,960
Actually

21
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,079
This making money is also second

22
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,600
Mainly, I want to earn my own living

23
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,200
So that the screwdriver who went to the room would not drop the words

24
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,280
The old lady in the Zhou family

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
Will allow you to go out and show your face

26
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:09,920
She

27
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,079
She couldn't wait to set off firecrackers to send me out

28
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,160
Why does Ben Wang think you

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,880
Go to the punishments department with ulterior motives

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,840
I have ulterior motives

31
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,840
I can not only have fun when I go to the punishments department

32
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,320
I can also make eye contact with my little husband

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,719
Get along day and night

34
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,840
Isn't this killing two birds with one stone

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,399
Go away

36
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,079
Nausea

37
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:38,399
Your Highness

38
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,840
Are you doing anything else

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,600
If you're okay, I'll go first

40
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,920
If I go late, my husband should wait in a hurry

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,079
You go quickly

42
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,600
Disappear in front of our king

43
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,560
All right

44
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,079
This big rooster tries me everywhere

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,639
Thanks to my wit

46
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,160
A Yue

47
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,680
This is the first time you and I have worked together

48
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,760
It's quite meaningful

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,079
Tall man

50
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,600
Pay attention to seriousness in court

51
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,120
Good

52
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:12,839
A Yue

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,839
Let's see how I decide

54
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:19,439
Pass the plaintiff

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
Pass the plaintiff

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
This tall man has a self-effacing appearance

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Xiao Xianggong refused for thousands of miles

58
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,199
What exactly is the relationship between the two

59
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,439
Who under the hall

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,799
What are you telling me

61
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,279
Little Man Gold and Yuan

62
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,439
Meet Your Excellency

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,400
Ask adults to make decisions for villains

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,279
Chen Shan years ago

65
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,600
I took a fancy to my sister

66
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Take her as a concubine

67
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,559
I forbid

68
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,999
Chen Shan is looking for trouble everywhere

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,199
And beat me in the restaurant

70
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,480
I pushed him to protect myself

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,359
I don't want him to roll down the stairs

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
What do you mean

73
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,919
Chen Shan deliberately provokes

74
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,760
You hurt him badly by mistake

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,600
Chen Shan, he is not seriously injured

76
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,199
Not seriously injured

77
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:11,520
It's not a serious injury to fall silly

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
Your Excellency

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,240
He is playing dumb

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,439
He played dumb on purpose to blackmail me

81
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
But the medical officer said he did hurt his brain

82
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
And you say he plays dumb

83
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,600
What evidence do you have

84
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,400
Your Excellency

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,999
After he fell down in Chen Shan,

86
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,760
Still sneering at me on purpose

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,359
Before pretending to faint

88
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:31,359
Your Excellency

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,439
He must be playing dumb

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,520
It's just

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,279
How silly and playing dumb

92
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,719
How can you tell clearly

93
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Ask adults to make decisions for villains

94
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,520
Indeed

95
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,639
How can you tell clearly

96
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:48,359
A Yue

97
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:49,960
Do you have a good plan

98
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,480
Let's call the witness at the time of the incident

99
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,120
Good

100
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:54,919
Cast a witness

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,639
Summon a witness to court

102
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,519
I let you

103
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,119
It's interesting to check the life experience of Shen Yu

104
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,439
No trace

105
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,999
What can be found

106
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,320
Is when I was a teenager

107
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Adopted by a traveling doctor

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,160
The cleaner it is, the more suspicious it is

109
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,679
Then you can check the traveling doctor

110
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,760
Is a woman who gave it to a country woman

111
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,040
Among the girls who delivered the baby

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
There's nothing to check

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,399
Among the girls

114
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,880
Right

115
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,160
What's the matter

116
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,480
There are too many secrets in Shen Yu

117
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,519
It seems necessary to send a spy

118
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,679
Go to her side

119
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,480
Wait

120
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,439
Shen Yu is your spy

121
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,880
You're looking for another spy now

122
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,760
To check on you as a spy

123
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,679
Why bother

124
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,320
Why don't you just change her

125
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,480
You are teaching Ben Wang to do things

126
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,439
See Your Excellency

127
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,719
Master Hui

128
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,200
The little man did see it

129
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
It was Chen Shan who was beaten by Jin Yuanxian

130
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,360
And kicked it down the stairs with his left leg

131
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,480
At three o'clock in the afternoon

132
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,399
I saw it too

133
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,880
It was Jin Yuan who beat Chen Shan with his right hand

134
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,600
Your Excellency

135
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,920
Little people can also testify

136
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,040
After Chen Shan was kicked down the stairs,

137
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,959
Immediately stupid as a child

138
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,760
Your Excellency

139
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,360
Little people are wronged

140
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,160
They have been in collusion for a long time

141
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
My mother hangs over this matter

142
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,200
The villain has lost his family

143
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,719
Ask adults to make decisions for villains

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,839
Silence

145
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,800
The case is clear enough

146
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,959
Gold and Yuan

147
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,640
You hold a grudge against Chen Shan

148
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,519
Be forced to marry your sister as a concubine

149
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,119
Seriously injured Chen Shan under disagreement

150
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,959
Make it stupid

151
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,320
To commit a heinous crime

152
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:58,839
Still dare to shout

153
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,600
Your Excellency

154
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,080
Little people are really wronged

155
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,679
Bearer

156
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,239
Put Jin Yuan in jail

157
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,080
Wait

158
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,559
Tall man

159
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,519
There are still objections in this case

160
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:08,640
Can you

161
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,519
There are gold and yuan boats floating on the lake

162
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,119
A closer look is a rockery

163
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,480
True mountains and rockeries are difficult to distinguish

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,719
The sun comes from fog

165
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:18,880
What the hell is this

166
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,839
A fish

167
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,999
Don't make trouble in court

168
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,360
I didn't make trouble

169
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,800
You must also think there is something strange about this matter

170
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,559
That's why I disagree with the trial of tall people

171
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,200
Right

172
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:39,999
You listen to me

173
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:52,880
Tall man

174
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:54,320
Sentence

175
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,519
Bearer

176
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:01,640
Put Jin Yuan in jail and await trial

177
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,999
Adults and villains are really wronged

178
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,679
Your Excellency

179
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
Little people are really wronged

180
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,360
Your Excellency

181
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,760
Little people are wronged, my Lord

182
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,200
Xianggong

183
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
You also think there are many doubts in this case

184
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,519
It is precisely because the three people agree that

185
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,959
That's why I showed my feet

186
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,839
That's right

187
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,119
At three o'clock in the afternoon

188
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,200
It was Jin Yuan who beat Chen Shan with his right hand

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,279
Noon hour

190
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,320
It is the time when restaurant guests come and go

191
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
It is also the busiest time for shopkeepers

192
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,839
But which hand does he even have

193
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:30,519
Chen Shan remembers it clearly

194
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,679
How is that possible

195
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,800
The little man did see it

196
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,399
It was Chen Shan who was beaten by Jin Yuanxian

197
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,399
There are still faint purple marks on both sides of his eyes

198
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,040
It means he suffered from a fever a week ago

199
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,119
Eyes swelling and pain caused by fire leakage

200
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,439
See clearly

201
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
It can't be

202
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,920
After Chen Shan was kicked down the stairs,

203
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,679
Immediately stupid as a child

204
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,800
After the average person's head is hit,

205
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,519
Because blood stagnation is difficult to remove

206
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,119
So they will faint first

207
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:56,880
But he said

208
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,160
Chen Shan was immediately as stupid as a child

209
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Obviously wrong

210
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,719
A fish

211
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,600
I always thought you were informal

212
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,360
I didn't expect to see it

213
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
So

214
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
You won't let me stop Gao Mo from sentencing Jin Yuan to jail

215
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,040
That's right

216
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,160
If Chen Shan is really playing dumb,

217
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,800
So only Jin Yuan is in prison

218
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,279
He can relax his vigilance

219
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,040
We have an opportunity

220
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,360
But even if he plays dumb, what can we do

221
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,920
Then find a famous doctor to examine the injury again

222
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,360
I heard that many famous doctors went to Beijing

223
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,480
There is nothing I can do

224
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,719
Where else can I find it

225
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,279
This famous doctor

226
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,120
Far away

227
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,600
Near

228
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,680
You

229
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:41,879
You are quite skilled in medicine

230
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,879
But this is a thorny disease after all

231
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,959
Can you do it

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,680
Xianggong

233
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,360
Don't you forget

234
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,199
Our original purpose was to lure the snake out of the hole

235
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,399
Since that is false,

236
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,480
Can a famous doctor treat an injury

237
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,639
Of course it doesn't matter

238
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,199
Then don't play too much

239
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:02,160
Don't worry

240
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,040
Let's go and have a look

241
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,680
Is he a real mountain or a rockery

242
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:10,719
Grandmother

243
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,000
Take a quick look at it

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,639
What line should this piece go with

245
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,519
Let me see

246
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,319
You see

247
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:21,480
Does it look good with this red line

248
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:22,360
Good-looking

249
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,440
Come and put this needle on

250
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,680
Mother

251
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,839
What's wrong with you looking unhappy

252
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,319
We sent three or four girls into Zhou Yue's room

253
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,839
They were all sent back by the sinking fish

254
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,079
It's useless

255
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,879
You can't blame them either

256
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,079
This sinking fish

257
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,240
The kung fu of the whole person is much different

258
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
Those girls have been there for less than a long time

259
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
I was tossed and wailed

260
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,079
I don't stay there anyway

261
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,639
Grandmother

262
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,839
You sit

263
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,519
Grandmother

264
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,600
You have to do something about it

265
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,759
Our Zhou family

266
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,920
Can't be governed by a street village woman

267
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,000
Let people laugh when it comes out

268
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,800
Since that Shen Shi

269
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,959
She has so much ability

270
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,440
Then we should also match her with one

271
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,319
The capable girl is the one

272
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,360
Send her

273
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,920
But don't you always think

274
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,639
Is the yam sent by my cousin

275
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:54,959
So it's just right

276
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,040
One can relieve my troubles

277
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,079
These two

278
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,879
Zhou Yue can think that Qi Zhang is watching him

279
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,160
The deeper the contradiction between them

280
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
The better it will be for us

281
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,920
Your name is

282
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,199
Yam, right

283
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,240
You just came to our third room

284
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,120
I don't know much about the rules of the fifth master

285
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,319
What about me

286
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,560
Tell you about Wu Ye's preferences

287
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,879
It is convenient for you to serve in the future

288
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,719
Yes

289
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,920
Fifth Master

290
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,160
Taste different customs

291
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:36,639
I like the ones with good physique

292
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:38,759
This horse step is the basic skill

293
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,279
Let me show you

294
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,719
You follow me

295
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
You see those girls last time

296
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
After tying a fragrant horse step,

297
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,319
I started to draw circles when I walked

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,719
Five Grannies

299
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,879
This one you made is not very standard

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,759
Legs should sink

301
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,920
Like me

302
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,879
Head suspension

303
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,959
Body uprightness

304
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,240
Pull back

305
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,079
Thoracic

306
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:02,759
Shoulder sinking

307
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
Be sure to sink your shoulders

308
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,040
Don't just look at me

309
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,920
Like me

310
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,759
Do it with me

311
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,160
Five-five grandma be careful

312
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,120
This horse step

313
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,920
Zamabu

314
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,839
It's not interesting either

315
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,680
Let's change the way we exercise

316
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,399
Can I borrow the broom

317
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,279
Be careful of Grandma Five

318
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,639
The handmaiden also knows a thing or two about the skill of sticks

319
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,759
Why don't we practice this

320
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,560
Peach

321
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,199
It suddenly occurred to me

322
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,079
Do we still have something to do

323
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,879
What? Grandma Five

324
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,879
Yeah, yeah, we do have something to do

325
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,519
Yam, look

326
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,120
I've been a little busy lately

327
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Let's put this exercise aside for a while

328
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,560
Let's talk about it another day

329
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,560
One or two of our family

330
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
I can't believe I can control that little smart guy

331
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,480
This is a windfall.

332
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,839
Everything comes down, everything comes down

333
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,360
I have to go to three more rooms these days

334
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,800
It feels much more fun than going to the theater

335
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,639
She is a married woman

336
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,800
What are you going to do

337
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,600
You can go. Why can't I go

338
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
I'm going to assign a task to one or two

339
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,800
Didn't I always set up tasks before

340
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,319
I will go in the future

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,800
Why

342
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,279
Good

343
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,600
You go

344
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,399
Why else

345
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
This yam

346
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,079
Same as the one sent to the room before

347
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,879
Those servant girls are completely different

348
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,120
That axial strength

349
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,759
People who don't look like old ladies at all

350
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,199
But inside this Hou Fu,

351
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,959
There is no one but the third room and the old lady

352
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,959
Big cock

353
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,079
Five Grannies

354
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
Here are the snacks for you

355
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,279
Wait a minute

356
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,639
What do you want from Grandma Five

357
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
Take me to your master

358
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,639
The present master of the handmaiden

359
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:15,000
It's the fifth grandmother and the fifth young master

360
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,480
I have no contact with the last room

361
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,759
Come on

362
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,839
I'm talking about your true master

363
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,519
Who is that

364
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,079
Qi Zhang

365
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,360
Guest officer, please

366
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,279
I'm looking for someone

367
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,759
He is a master with great momentum

368
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,040
Please get the Tianzihao room

369
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,560
This time, the name of Tianzihao is still a bit like it

370
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,000
My guest, please come inside

371
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,319
This place has to pay silver in advance

372
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,639
Yeah, so I want you to arrive half an hour before me

373
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,240
You pick a place to meet me

374
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,519
And I have to pay

375
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,800
Gold, silver and money can't be brought with you, and you can't be brought with you

376
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,879
Then what do you care about

377
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,120
Besides

378
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,800
Your Highness has more money than he can spend

379
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,000
We should hire more spies to spread money

380
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,680
That's what you called me here to say

381
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,719
If you ask me to say that you are really redundant

382
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,120
If you want to know anything,

383
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,639
As long as your money is given

384
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:35,399
I must have said everything

385
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,519
Why are you playing this dummy behind my back

386
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:41,959
So

387
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,040
What so

388
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,040
People

389
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,599
You can stay if you want to

390
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,160
Kill if you want

391
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:53,080
For the exposed spy

392
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,999
I never leave anyone alive

393
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,239
Play hard with me, don't you

394
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,680
But you don't have to shout and kill

395
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,920
As the saying goes

396
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,519
One person counts short and two people count long

397
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,359
Yam and I

398
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,800
That is, one or two

399
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,560
The two of us are at Zhou's house with each other

400
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,840
There is also a care

401
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,479
Or just stay

402
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,639
Your Highness

403
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,879
You said that in the future, in case I was exposed,

404
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,680
You can't be so cruel to me, can you

405
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,999
I told you

406
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,040
An exposed spy

407
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,359
The end is the same

408
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,119
It turns out that I am in your highness's heart

409
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,879
It's the same as other spies

410
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,200
Since entering Beijing,

411
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
Every time I'm in distress

412
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,200
Suffer setbacks

413
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,759
Your Highness is by my side

414
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,999
I have long regarded your highness as a bosom friend in my heart

415
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,279
Treat it like a relative

416
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,519
It's my own love

417
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,519
Then look at your highness's look

418
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,560
You don't think you'll kill me

419
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,920
If nothing happens, I will leave first

420
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,359
Something

421
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:44,840
Something

422
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,639
Something

423
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,519
Something

424
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,040
What is it

425
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,519
I want to borrow two people from Changtaiban with you

426
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:52,680
What person

427
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,399
I want someone who can sing opera

428
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:57,599
It's best to be the kind that plays very well

429
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,519
Then send five more

430
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,960
Ten, please

431
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,639
Especially able to take a taxi

432
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,840
I'll give it back to you once

433
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,720
Can sing opera, can play and can play

434
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,479
What are you going to do with it

435
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,359
Complete the task you gave me, of course

436
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Don't you want to put

437
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,359
Mrs. Zhou was tied up and forced to confess

438
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,560
This is also a way

439
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,320
What are you looking at

440
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:49,040
Of course I see pretty girls

441
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:50,920
Your Highness

442
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,440
Let's continue the topic just now

443
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,479
Would you please sit down

444
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,999
They asked for the number one by name

445
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,680
Why should I go

446
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,239
Good girl

447
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,840
Those two guests are not easy to provoke at first sight

448
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,639
String songs She is ignorant of the world

449
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm afraid she can't entertain

450
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,479
White mother has always been eccentric

451
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,200
White Mother

452
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,160
Who do you want to see

453
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,399
The two guests of Tianzihao

454
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,399
I want to see the number one here by name

455
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,800
Mom is afraid that you will not be able to deal with it

456
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:26,320
Tianzihao

457
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,479
It's them

458
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,759
How

459
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,160
You've seen them

460
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,680
Haven't seen it

461
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,440
But since they want to see the true Buddha,

462
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,800
I must have inquired about it already

463
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:44,999
It's useless to change my sister

464
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,560
Mom, rest assured

465
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,359
Nor are they man-eating beasts

466
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,040
String songs and go and have a look

467
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,800
Let's just make a deal

468
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,759
Who made a deal with you

469
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,560
It's a deal. What you just said

470
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,800
You also ordered to listen to music

471
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,239
What tune would you like to hear

472
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,040
Can girls remember Luo Yue

473
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,040
There is no evidence for the news from the wild goose

474
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,239
It is difficult for Lu Yao to return to his dream

475
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,279
Girl wants to hear Yi Luo Yue

476
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,639
But I miss my loved ones

477
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:48,960
Yeah

478
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,119
I also listened to the song

479
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:49,800
Things are done, too

480
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,639
Let's go

481
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:52,999
Shen fish

482
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,359
Shen fish

483
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,040
Nothing

484
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,960
What's wrong with you

485
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:15,879
Nothing

486
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,800
Nothing

487
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,840
So you

488
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,720
Why are you crying

489
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,399
I didn't

490
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:24,479
I just yawned when I was sleepy

491
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,080
Such a clumsy lie

492
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,359
Do you think Ben Wang will believe it

493
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,560
Believe it or not

494
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,399
Does this have anything to do with our deal

495
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,999
Why do you care so much about me

496
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,840
This king doesn't care about you

497
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:38,920
Is to remind you

498
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,680
A competent spy

499
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,239
Be invisible to your emotions

500
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,639
You look like this

501
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:44,920
Ben Wang is worried about whether you have any way

502
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,800
Complete a task

503
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,720
Your Highness, if you are worried, change me quickly

504
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,759
Clearly care about others

505
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,879
Why do you have to say something so ugly

506
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,399
Girls are born to be coaxed

507
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,080
To be spoiled

508
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,720
Your attitude like this

509
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,680
Who can stand it

510
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,840
I don't care

511
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:10,840
And

512
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,320
Who asked her to accept it

513
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,879
Keep your mouth shut and you'll just

514
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,960
Then again

515
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,279
Why did she ask you out

516
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:20,759
She asked me to borrow some people from Chang Taiban

517
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:29,960
Why are you following me

518
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,759
Go and borrow someone

519
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,320
There is a girl named Gu Yi looking for you

520
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,800
Uncle is the hospital envoy of Tai Hospital

521
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,840
Who will bully us in the future

522
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,560
You are the first one who needs protection

523
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,160
So big and bitten by a dog

524
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,279
After that, you can protect me

525
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:41,160
What happened to the girl

526
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,080
I want to learn martial arts and be a master

527
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:47,519
Lest you be bullied in the future

528
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,279
You are really Yi

529
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,279
A Le

530
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,399
You're still alive

531
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,720
My sister really didn't expect it

532
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,320
Our sisters will live

533
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,999
I can still meet like this

534
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,440
You've suffered a lot, haven't you

535
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:52,200
I have also suffered a lot of grievances, right

536
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,399
No

537
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
No no no

538
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,599
No

539
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,359
Our status

540
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,720
Be able to live in the world

541
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,399
It is not easy

542
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,440
Why are you here

543
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:22,879
A Le

544
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,759
It's a long story

545
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,320
In a word

546
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,599
Under the cover of the nest

547
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,720
Ann has finished his eggs

548
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,599
What about you, sister

549
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,999
Why did you come to Beijing

550
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,479
I can't finish a sentence or two

551
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,680
Wait for me

552
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,519
I will definitely take you out

553
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,599
You have a little patience

554
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,960
You wait for your sister

555
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,840
Okay

556
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,920
Why did she go and return

557
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,119
Is it related to the singer just now

558
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,200
I said this childe

559
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,519
Will you buy it or not

560
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,599
If you don't buy it, don't affect my business

561
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,399
That

562
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,759
What are you doing standing here? Really

563
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,519
Excuse me

564
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:49,960
Really

565
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:52,999
What are you doing

566
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,519
Take it

567
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,040
Good good

568
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,879
What is your highness doing here

569
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,040
Take a stroll around

570
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,440
Your Highness won't have a crush on it

571
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,960
Which girl in Changtai class

572
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,800
Want to buy this back

573
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,279
Give it to others as a token of love

574
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:34,800
Boredom

575
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,920
It can't be to follow me, can it

576
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,160
I think your highness

577
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
It doesn't look like a rooster or a thief

578
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,239
Just mind your own business

579
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:53,840
Don't you go

580
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,840
I'm hungry, your highness. Please invite me to dinner

581
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:02,999
What for

582
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm like this. You won't have the heart to refuse me, will you

583
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,960
What do you want to eat? Let's go

584
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:22,800
It's so cold

585
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,239
Why are you going

586
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,800
You dawdle a little longer. It's getting dark

587
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,920
Fish is not easy to catch

588
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,200
If you want to eat fish

589
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,720
Ben Wang will take you to a restaurant

590
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,320
Why do you have to catch fish yourself

591
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,960
You don't know that

592
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,239
Fish, of course

593
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,639
It's delicious to catch and eat by yourself

594
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:36,999
You don't know

595
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,279
The whole capital counts the best fish here

596
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:40,759
Take it off quickly

597
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:41,999
Detach

598
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,960
Do not take off

599
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,560
You can't take it off

600
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,560
Of course not

601
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,999
This king is also a prince stationed on one side

602
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,960
What is it like to go down to the river to catch fish with you

603
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,119
Fish fish

604
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,560
Is catching fish fun

605
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,840
Not bad

606
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,639
Don't tell me you haven't caught fish before

607
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,720
I grew up in the border with my father since I was a child

608
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,599
Because he is the only child in the family

609
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,040
So my father didn't want to

610
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,639
Let me do anything dangerous

611
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,599
Your Highness

612
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:17,960
Catch a fish

613
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,720
It smells good. Here

614
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,560
Thank you very much

615
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,840
Is it delicious

616
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,279
Isn't it delicious

617
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,399
I told you so

618
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,200
This is delicious only when it is fished and baked now

619
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,119
Still don't believe it

620
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,800
How do you know the fish in this river are delicious

621
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,720
Zhou Yue told you

622
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,239
Right

623
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,479
It really tastes good

624
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,320
Of course

625
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,879
When I was a child, I had no food

626
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:20,800
I ran to the river to catch fish and roast it

627
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,200
It's just that

628
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,440
No matter how delicious the grilled fish is,

629
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:26,680
It's not as good as my mother's cooking

630
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,040
Mother's cooking

631
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,560
What's that taste like

632
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:39,440
Your mother hasn't cooked food for you

633
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,960
As a child

634
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,160
There is a special cook in Wangfu cooking

635
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:46,840
When you grow up

636
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,639
There is no chance

637
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:53,079
It seems that we are both unhappy people at the end of the world

638
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,559
Who is the same as you, the unhappy--to the sky's end

639
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,720
This king sits in the northwest

640
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,280
There are fiefs and military power

641
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,240
There are inexhaustible treasures of gold and silver

642
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:03,960
Same as you

643
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,079
What's the big deal

644
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,319
So what you're holding right now is a grilled fish

645
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,760
So what do you want to hold

646
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,399
Grilled fish, too

647
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:33,599
Xianggong

648
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:39,160
Has that yam been sent away

649
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,440
Don't worry, she won't do anything to you

650
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,639
I'm just worried about being held hostage by the old lady

651
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,799
Her master is not an old lady

652
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:48,639
What are you talking about

653
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,440
I said her master is not an old lady

654
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,559
Her master

655
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,280
It's me

656
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,160
She's mine now

657
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,520
She will never bother you again from now on

658
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,799
That's right

659
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:05,319
How are things going with Chen Shan

660
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:06,480
Has followed what you said

661
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,039
Sent a letter to Chen Fu

662
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,319
Said the punishments department found a famous doctor to see Chen Shan

663
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,799
The disease is expected to be cured

664
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,359
The Chen family has some complaints

665
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,359
But it should still be down

666
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:16,520
It should be good to get off

667
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,879
Next

668
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,119
It's time for the magic doctor to come out

669
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,520
My Lord, my Lord

670
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:32,559
Coming, coming

671
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,000
Master

672
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,399
Coming, coming, the punishments department is coming

673
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:40,319
What should come will come

674
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:41,480
You go and bring them in

675
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,119
I'm going to see the mountains

676
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:43,960
It's my Lord

677
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,079
Doctor, give me the medicine cabinet

678
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,480
Give it to me

679
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,359
What's the matter, Doctor

680
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,599
The patient is still waiting inside

681
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:10,760
Please

682
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,399
What's the matter

683
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,799
What are you doing here

684
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:31,280
Why don't you let me borrow so many people

685
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,920
I have to come and see what the hell you're up to

686
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,039
I'm on business today

687
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,639
Don't tear me down

688
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:38,079
Isn't it an adult doctor in the Western Regions

689
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:38,960
No translation required

690
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,559
No need

691
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,480
Need, need, need

692
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,280
You can speak Western dialect

693
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,160
At least they don't understand

694
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,319
I just think you have ulterior motives

695
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,280
I call this good intentions

696
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,760
This medical officer from the punishments department

697
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,119
It turned out to be from the Western Regions

698
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,160
Your Excellency the medical officer said

699
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Where is the patient

700
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,599
Go early and return early

701
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,079
The patient is in the bedroom

702
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:10,960
I'll take adults

703
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,720
The pillow cloud is waiting here

704
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,639
Doctor, please

705
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,839
What's wrong with you

706
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:21,200
Let you help me translate the hard work

707
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,440
Why don't you translate

708
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,079
This is the only son I have

709
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,839
Now it's like this

710
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:40,280
What to do with this

711
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,480
Even if it's silly

712
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,520
It should also be for this kind of

713
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,599
External injury has instinctive avoidance reaction

714
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,639
So choked back

715
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,359
On the contrary, it shows that you are guilty

716
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,520
Stupid

717
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,280
Stupid than a pig

718
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,119
Why do you swear

719
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,000
Master Chen

720
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,720
God officials come from the Western Regions

721
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,680
Not very proficient in the language of our enlightenment

722
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,319
I hope you'll forgive me

723
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:14,879
But

724
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,559
Not stupid enough yet

725
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,240
It can still be saved

726
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Have a way

727
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,559
Knowing that Chen Shan married a beautiful woman

728
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,680
And get into trouble

729
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,960
I will give it what I want

730
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,639
Kind of clever

731
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,599
Master Chen

732
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,240
Don't worry about it

733
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:52,839
Your son is

734
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:54,280
Intracerebral stasis

735
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,680
Upwelling of Qi and Blood

736
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,079
We need to use this snake from the Western Regions

737
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,920
To assist the treatment

738
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,200
Only in this way can he be restored to his dirty appearance

739
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,280
After all, stupid people don't know how to be afraid

740
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,720
Dirty people understand

741
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,799
It seems that the information is accurate

742
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:17,680
This Chen Shan is really afraid of snakes

743
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,520
See how you pretend

744
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,119
Deal with stupidity

745
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,000
Family-oriented holographic needle method is the most effective

746
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,920
If she really cares for the descendants of her family,

747
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,240
As long as the needle is applied

748
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,319
It will definitely make the other party lose control and reveal flaws

749
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,639
Follow me to death, right

750
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,319
If I use the holographic needle method of caring for my family,

751
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,240
Don't believe you don't show any flaws

752
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:51,359
Shen Yu, as long as you use a holographic needle

753
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,319
I can be sure that you are a family member

754
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,399
Can she use a needle or not

755
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:01,200
Do you want to use it or not

756
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,839
This man is so stupid

757
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:10,520
Bring it back to the punishments department

758
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,680
I want to treat it slowly

759
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,520
Somebody

760
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,520
Take it away for me

761
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,119
No, no, no

762
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:14,960
No

763
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:17,639
What do you do? I'm the doctor. I have the final say

764
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,280
Imperial Doctor

765
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,399
Beard

766
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:27,639
Are you all right

767
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:29,920
Nothing

768
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,639
Take it away quickly

769
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,799
Wait a minute

770
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,280
I've been curious since the doctor entered the door

771
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,720
This Western Regions doctor is as delicate as a woman

772
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,039
This starts to walk

773
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:45,799
There is no man to look like

774
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,240
I just found out

775
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,200
This magic doctor has a smooth neck

776
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,480
There is no Adam's apple

777
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,920
Very feminine

778
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,680
This is not my daughter's house, is it

779
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,920
The Imperial Doctor

780
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,039
What's wrong with being born without Adam's apple

781
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,760
It was born without

782
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,119
Or is there another reason

783
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:05,039
This has to be confirmed before we know

784
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:06,639
How do you want to confirm

785
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,039
Naturally, it is a body search

786
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,920
In this way, you can also clear the innocence of the magic doctor

787
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,480
Go

788
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,440
Get an older woman over here

789
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,119
Yes

790
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,079
Presumptuous

791
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,760
The Western Regions Imperial Doctor is our punishments department

792
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,359
Please come to see your son

793
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,399
Are you allowed to humiliate your beak here

794
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:26,799
If you have any questions about this

795
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,119
You can go to the punishments department and confront us

796
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,480
According to the statute of the great enlightenment

797
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,720
Search foreign messengers privately

798
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,520
When chop

799
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:34,399
Well said

800
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:35,839
Bearer

801
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:36,359
In

802
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:36,920
Take away

803
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:37,480
Yes

804
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:43,119
Shan'er Shan'er

805
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:45,520
Shan Er Shan Er, come back

806
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,639
You can't take it with you

807
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,639
Back to the punishments department

808
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,440
Your Highness, thank you very much for what happened today

809
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,240
It is said that great kindness is not thanked

810
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,760
You were going to take it with the word thank you

811
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,440
Then stay close to me later

812
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,399
Why

813
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:22,960
Where are we going

814
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,000
I walked for an hour and didn't arrive

815
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:42,520
There are mountain thieves

816
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,639
Where do mountain thieves come from in the suburbs of Beijing

817
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:57,760
I'm not acting

818
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,359
You are like this

819
00:44:58,639 --> 00:44:59,799
I'm I'm dead

820
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:26,039
You

821
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:42,799
Come

822
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,839
You give me another cut

823
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,799
Cut it down

824
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:49,319
Where to cut

825
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,599
Thanks for the rescue. It's none of my business

826
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,319
What are you running for

827
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,599
Stop acting

828
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:01,480
Everyone ran away

829
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,399
You're not hurt, are you

830
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:10,520
No

831
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,599
You can see that

832
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,160
Boring

833
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,799
Ben Wang just

834
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:17,760
But I am cooperating with you to perform with my heart

835
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,399
Our Royal Highness

836
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:21,599
But I haven't cooperated with others to perform

837
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,319
How is it

838
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:25,480
Everyone's gone

839
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,599
Do you still play

840
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:27,119
Act

841
00:47:03,879 --> 00:47:04,639
Mother

842
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:06,960
Mother

843
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,799
I'm coming to accompany you

844
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,160
It's the voice of Jin Yuan

845
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,720
Why are you here

846
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,559
The punishments department is birds of a feather with that Chen Shan

847
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:15,839
Isn't Jin Yuan dead

848
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,960
Put me in jail, and I have nowhere to redress my grievances

849
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,240
You can only express your ambition by death

850
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:22,680
He is now

851
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,639
His, his ghost

852
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:26,639
Chen Shan, a scoundrel

853
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,240
It ruined our family

854
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,280
Died

855
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,480
Now I'm going to take him

856
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,960
Take it with you to the ten halls of Yamaraja

857
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,839
Please give us justice

858
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:41,280
It's the dead mother of Jinyuan hanging beam

859
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,520
Old lady

860
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:47,119
Jin Yuan, I was wrong. Please spare me

861
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,760
Why do you want to hurt my son

862
00:47:57,319 --> 00:47:58,680
I can't marry by force

863
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,399
Want revenge

864
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,639
That's why I framed Jin Yuan

865
00:48:02,399 --> 00:48:03,399
Old lady

866
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,960
Don't take me to hell

867
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,720
I'll go back to the yamen and turn myself in

868
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,399
Don't come over to return Jinyuan's innocence

869
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,119
Give me a break

870
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,399
Old lady, I beg you

871
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,319
Give me a break. Give me a break

872
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:18,399
Old lady

873
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:19,599
Give me a break

874
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,359
Give me a break

875
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:23,039
Give me a break

876
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,359
Please, please

877
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,559
Give me a break

878
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,319
You

879
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:36,599
You guys

880
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,319
Tell me something about you

881
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,879
Why would someone hurt you with a poisoned arrow

882
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,839
I'm asking you a question

883
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,119
It's really heartless

884
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,760
It's in vain for me to find so many medicines to treat you

885
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,839
With your face

886
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:30,319
Don't say that you are committed to each other

887
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,399
And ignore me

888
00:49:31,399 --> 00:49:32,160
Presumptuous

889
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,879
Don't you dare speak to me like that

890
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:35,200
Of course I dare

891
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,319
Who do you think you are

892
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,000
Prince

893
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Sovereign

894
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,119
I won't let you commit yourself

895
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,839
Being my boy is flattering you

896
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,920
Be your boy

897
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,680
You really have a lot of courage

898
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,079
Thank you for your compliment

899
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,920
My courage has always been great

900
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,720
Hunting up the mountain and catching fish in the river

901
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,799
I'm good at everything

902
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,680
You speak

903
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:01,680
What are you doing

904
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,280
I'm just giving needles for convenience

905
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,879
What are you fussing about

906
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,639
What exactly do you want

907
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:11,520
I just want to see the bodies of boys

908
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,480
Is it really different

909
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,079
Aren't you a boy yourself

910
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:17,680
Right

911
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,359
What I mean is

912
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,039
Want to see you and me

913
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:22,559
What's the difference between us

914
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:25,079
There is no object to practice acupuncture on weekdays

915
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,000
How nice you are to be here, a ready-made living person

916
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,559
Needle application

917
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,240
Are you trying to take advantage of my eyes

918
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,079
To inflict harm on me

919
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,920
It's despicable and vicious

920
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,200
You're pointing in the wrong direction
