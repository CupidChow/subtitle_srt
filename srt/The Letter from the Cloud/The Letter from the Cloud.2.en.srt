1
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
Who sent you here

2
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:52,760
Say

3
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Poisoned

4
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,040
Keep alive

5
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
Fish, be careful

6
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,800
Go, go, go

7
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,360
You go quickly

8
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,239
Otherwise, no one can leave

9
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:31,960
Madam

10
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,079
Grind and chatter like a pussy

11
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,160
Where's Ayue

12
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,399
Who has seen the fifth young master

13
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,599
The young master said

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,520
We are never allowed to serve at night

15
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,719
Shit

16
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,679
It seems that the fifth young master is still in the room

17
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,319
A Yue

18
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,800
Madam

19
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,679
A Yue

20
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,959
This way

21
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,679
Slow down

22
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,840
Slow down

23
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,520
Hold on a bit

24
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,200
It's choking me to death

25
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,880
Let's jump down

26
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,560
Jump down

27
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,079
Xianggong, jump down

28
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,880
Don't you move

29
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,639
A Yue

30
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:10,840
Jump down so high

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,399
You have to be half disabled if you don't die

32
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,160
A Yue

33
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,880
Young Master

34
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,359
A Yue

35
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,280
Are you all right, fish

36
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,639
Xianggong, are you all right

37
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm okay

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,880
Go quickly

39
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,240
Young Master

40
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,959
Five Grannies

41
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,520
Fool

42
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,480
You

43
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,120
You stop for me

44
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,439
Five Grannies

45
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,639
In the past, it was the handmaiden who blamed you wrong

46
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:40,600
Unexpectedly

47
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,759
You are still a righteous woman who bravely saved her husband

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,439
Righteous woman

49
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,280
I

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,959
Yeah

51
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,200
How much is this title worth

52
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:47,999
Righteous woman

53
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:48,639
Five Grannies

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,319
This is a great honor

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,200
How can this be measured in money

56
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,959
You are going to fold this title into a silver ticket for me

57
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:54,840
I'll be happier

58
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,679
A Yue

59
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:58,720
Are you hurt

60
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm okay

61
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,440
Go and see the fish quickly

62
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,039
She risked her life to save me

63
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,280
If it's okay, it'll scare my mother to death

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,399
Isn't that aunt

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,239
Who is the man holding her

66
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,679
By the chance of fire,

67
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,679
Turn saving people in water into saving people in flames

68
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,519
These two people have fairly vivid brains

69
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,039
The next play

70
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,159
I'll sing with you

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,640
Little aunt

72
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:23,799
You

73
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,679
How did you let a wild man get you back

74
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,000
You're a widow

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,239
Under this public,

76
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,440
How will you meet people in the future

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,200
Sister-in-law

78
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:32,519
I

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,679
Madam

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,120
The fire is so fast that I have no time to think about it

81
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,239
If my lady blames me for ruining the girl's reputation

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,280
Liu Que is willing to marry a girl

83
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm afraid the poor family is not worthy of the girl

84
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,480
You get up and talk first

85
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,080
How can saving people in this fire take care of so much

86
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,159
Although it is to save people

87
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,519
Speak of this reputation

88
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,840
It's good to say, it's not good to hear, is it

89
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,319
Isn't that right, little aunt

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
You in public

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,399
Let a foreman bring it back

92
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,039
You lonely man and widowed woman cuddle

93
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,000
What kind of style is it

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,720
Drowning people after spittle planetesimals

95
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:10,560
Right

96
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,840
How can I see people in the future

97
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,599
This inn burned like this

98
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,080
Let's find a town to settle down first

99
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,679
A top priority

100
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,840
It is to ask for medical treatment for the injured

101
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:24,879
About my aunt

102
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,440
Let's discuss it later

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,759
Right

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,720
A Yue is right

105
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,159
Let's discuss it later. Let's discuss it later

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,840
Get up, get up

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,159
Just narrowly escaped thinking about making money

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,039
I really underestimate you

109
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,080
Go

110
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,040
About your little aunt last night

111
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,000
Strange to say

112
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,840
This phoenix has a nest and a bird has a nest

113
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,639
Shen Yu has only been married to our house for a few days

114
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,519
It has nothing to do with your little aunt

115
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,880
How can you bother and bother

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,679
Defend for her

117
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,079
Murphy

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,199
She's the one who did it

119
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,840
Whether it's a crisis, see the truth

120
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,440
Or is there someone playing tricks

121
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,600
Since the goddess has a heart,

122
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,919
Xiang Wang has a dream

123
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,959
Why should we beat Mandarin ducks

124
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,079
Thanks to Shen Yu, too

125
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,160
This matter is just a matter of course

126
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,840
Also send my little aunt back to Suzhou

127
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,679
You could have seen that

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,760
That girl

129
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,679
No profit can't afford to be early

130
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,959
It's just that I didn't think

131
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,120
She will fight her life to save me

132
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,320
I used to dislike her vulgarity and greed for money

133
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,399
Now it seems that

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,160
Maybe I lost my eyes

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Heard

136
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,040
She had already escaped last night

137
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Then I ran back and risked my life to save you

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,280
See people's hearts for a long time

139
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,479
Let's see it first

140
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,479
We have been treading on thin ice all these years

141
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,760
Deal with the screwdriver

142
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,560
It's better to be cautious

143
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,760
But

144
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,840
If she is as affectionate and righteous as she was yesterday

145
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,399
I will be kind to her

146
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,079
Those dead men belong to King Ning

147
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,519
It seems that it is not Chong Zhou's family

148
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,199
It's coming for me

149
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,799
Fell me twice for no reason

150
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,799
This man is really

151
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,320
Better not let me see it again

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,239
Otherwise, even the medical expenses

153
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,320
With interest and principal

154
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,919
Give it back to me

155
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,760
What person

156
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Tongque Building Tianzi No.1 Room

157
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,320
Talk about two thousand gold

158
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,199
Big deal

159
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
This must be an accomplice of the people who set the fire

160
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,280
A conspiracy is definitely a conspiracy

161
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,120
But what's the use of him setting me up

162
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,280
And about the Bronze Sparrow Building

163
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,679
Sounds like a big restaurant

164
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,239
Many people and mixed eyes

165
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,560
Seek wealth in danger

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Go

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,440
Sure enough, it is magnificent

168
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,519
It's a place to talk about big business

169
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Be superficial

170
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,880
At first glance, it is necessary to do deceptive activities

171
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,079
Haven't seen the owner yet

172
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,919
Is about to leave

173
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,679
Why are you again

174
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,719
Who the hell are you

175
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,000
What are you pestering me for

176
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,400
Didn't I just tell you

177
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
A business owner

178
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,320
Two thousand gold

179
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,960
It's you

180
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,000
Fool

181
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,719
It's up to you to find this place

182
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,479
You can't afford to be my boss

183
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,080
What kind of person is that

184
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
To be your owner

185
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,080
Rich man

186
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,799
Is this money rich

187
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,960
Come on, guys. Upstairs, please

188
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,400
Give me a snack

189
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,239
All right

190
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,080
It really deserves to be Tianzi No.1

191
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,039
A table and a chair

192
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,560
A teacup and a lamp

193
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,039
Not satisfied

194
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,440
Go ahead

195
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,200
How can this silver ticket become mine

196
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,039
It's very simple

197
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,159
Do things for me at my command

198
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,039
Based on my past experience,

199
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,960
The fewer words, the bigger things

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,839
You're scared

201
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,719
Of course I'm afraid

202
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,239
Who knows what errand you're going to give me

203
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,039
A business that has a life to make money and a life to spend

204
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,120
I never do it

205
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,080
Be so timid

206
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,760
Then you still save Zhou Yue

207
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,520
Two different things

208
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
I was expecting to be able to

209
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,279
Week

210
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,039
Zhou Yue is my husband

211
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,880
Didn't I take it for granted that I saved him

212
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,000
So

213
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,520
You husband and wife are really stronger than gold

214
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,359
Why do you look so familiar to me

215
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,039
Have we met before

216
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,479
Big cock

217
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,520
Is that you

218
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,719
Are you approaching me for some purpose

219
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,359
I'll pay for it

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,120
You are in charge of doing things

221
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,400
Have no right to ask questions

222
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,479
Then I quit

223
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:33,120
This big rooster

224
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,599
I didn't mean to keep me at all

225
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,839
It suddenly occurred to me

226
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,440
I ordered a pastry that can't be wasted

227
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm going to finish eating here before leaving

228
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
My guest, the pastry you ordered

229
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,919
You have to go. I'll wrap it up for you

230
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,200
All right

231
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,799
I'll account for your business

232
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,320
No killing, no setting fire

233
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Do not violate the laws of the great enlightenment

234
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,760
Don't hurt ordinary people

235
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,679
If you do

236
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
This gold is yours

237
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,159
If you don't do it

238
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,239
Those cakes you ordered just now

239
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,320
It's my treat

240
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,080
Wouldn't it be over if you said so earlier

241
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,440
I don't know

242
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
Why did you choose me to be your dog

243
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,520
You won't let me ask

244
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
But there are some ugly words

245
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,719
I still have to make it clear to you in advance

246
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,120
Say

247
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,479
I know I'm good-looking

248
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
But I'm already a married woman

249
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,239
And she is a chaste martyr

250
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,599
You

251
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,359
Don't have any wild desires for me

252
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,960
Or it will be you who get hurt

253
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,599
I've really never seen it before

254
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,479
A cheeky woman like you

255
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,960
That's because you haven't seen the world

256
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,239
Go ahead

257
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,679
What's my first assignment

258
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,520
After entering Beijing,

259
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,239
First

260
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,120
You have to gain a firm foothold in Zhou's house

261
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,880
Become next to the old lady in Houfu

262
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,159
A caring person

263
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,239
Why the Zhou family

264
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:08,960
Good

265
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,919
I don't ask

266
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
In order to facilitate your foothold as soon as possible,

267
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:15,080
I can give you the details of Zhou's big room

268
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,799
Tell you

269
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,440
How do you know so much about the Chow family

270
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,799
Young Master

271
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,919
A tall man from the punishments department came to Beijing

272
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,599
Said to ask about the case of the fire at the post the day before yesterday

273
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,799
Tall man

274
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,560
Yes, he also said he wanted to see you by name

275
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,000
I see

276
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,919
I'll be there now

277
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,839
Ayue Ayue

278
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,799
You go down first

279
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,239
Yes

280
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,039
A Yue

281
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,200
Are you all right

282
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,039
Are you hurt

283
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:52,080
Tall people are now assistant ministers of punishments

284
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm just a bunch of cloth

285
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,359
Dare to use the former title

286
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,760
You and I don't care about this

287
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,520
I got the news when I got up in the morning

288
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,880
Said you were assassinated in the suburbs

289
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,279
Scared my soul out

290
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
Pegasus came without my clothes on

291
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,960
You don't believe it

292
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,359
I don't believe you. Look, I'm really not wearing it

293
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:10,880
That's enough

294
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,839
Backward

295
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,760
Keep a distance

296
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,440
Tall man

297
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,239
Don't you have something to ask

298
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,080
Right

299
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,880
I sent someone to check the inn

300
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,359
Examined the assassin's body

301
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,679
It's a captive dead man

302
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,839
But clothes

303
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,279
On weapons and bodies

304
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,279
Didn't leave any clues

305
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,679
Not a mountain bandit

306
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,239
It's a dead man

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,919
Then why do you want to attack our Zhou family

308
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,560
To be investigated in detail

309
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
But you can rest assured

310
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,679
I will definitely find out the murderer

311
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,520
Protect you well

312
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,960
In this case

313
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,039
Then Zhou is waiting for good news from adults

314
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,839
Adults walk slowly

315
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,479
I didn't say I was leaving

316
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,799
Your family is unprotected

317
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,760
What should I do if I encounter danger again

318
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,080
Why don't I walk with you

319
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,640
I'll escort you all the way into Zhou Fu

320
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,679
Big people are too busy to bother

321
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Please, please

322
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,359
Why do you keep pushing me out

323
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Classmate for three years

324
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,120
I don't think I have offended myself

325
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,599
Why do you always treat other people

326
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,960
Everyone is warm in the spring breeze

327
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,520
Only to me as cold as ice

328
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,400
The world can be divided into congenial and uncongenial

329
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,719
Do you have to win the eyes of everyone in the world

330
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,000
Then who do you hit it off with

331
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,200
With your happy lady

332
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,640
Me and my wife two of a kind

333
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,799
Naturally hit it off

334
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,120
In that case

335
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,719
Why at this time

336
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,640
She's not in love with you here

337
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,960
But drink with other men in the Bronze Sparrow Building

338
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,479
Gao Mo, what do you mean

339
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,120
I

340
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,320
Literal meaning of a word

341
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,479
If you don't believe me, go and see for yourself

342
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,640
I'm afraid you haven't come to Beijing yet

343
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,200
All the people in Beijing have known it

344
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,400
Gao Mo is silly but never lies

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,120
Is Shen Yu really hiding something from me

346
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,400
Where is she now? Take me to her

347
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,560
Come with me

348
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,919
You can remember the situation of Zhou's big room clearly

349
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,520
I remember clearly

350
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,159
I even their hens now

351
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,320
When will the eggs be laid

352
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,880
I remember it all clearly

353
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,080
Let me tell you something

354
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,599
When I make money,

355
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,479
The brain is the brightest

356
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,719
You can't give a deposit first

357
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,520
You can give a deposit

358
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,479
But I have three rules

359
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,599
It's not easy to earn some money from you

360
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,679
You said

361
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:48,239
First

362
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,479
My cooperation with you

363
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,120
Don't tell anyone

364
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,080
Second

365
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,719
As long as you know what I told you

366
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:54,679
No questioning

367
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,839
Third

368
00:17:59,159 --> 00:17:59,919
What's the matter

369
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,679
When I remember it,

370
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,839
I'll tell you again

371
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
I really threw up

372
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,359
I hate owners like you most

373
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,000
Really posturing

374
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,120
What's the matter

375
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
The number of words is less

376
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,919
It seems that you have no culture, doesn't it

377
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,760
Do you say it or not

378
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:14,560
Don't say I took the money

379
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,320
I have to check whether your money is real or not

380
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,440
Now the world is getting worse

381
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,159
Some fake silver tickets are more real than real ones

382
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,159
You will also verify the authenticity of the silver ticket

383
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,159
Of course

384
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,679
When I was a child, our government

385
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:28,159
Women walk in rivers and lakes

386
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,200
When you encounter more liars, you will naturally

387
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:31,799
Good

388
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Then you have a good test

389
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,719
It's best to check one by one

390
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,479
Let me do it

391
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,239
Your body is weak

392
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,160
If in case

393
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,199
I mean just in case

394
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,280
In case you want to see something insulting Sven

395
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,439
An unsightly picture

396
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,920
I'm afraid you can't bear it

397
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,599
Get out of the way

398
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
Don't worry, I took your money

399
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
You are my gold master

400
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,439
Don't say westward in the future

401
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,160
You can let me go to heaven

402
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,800
Ayue, you can rest assured

403
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,439
I'll be sure for a while

404
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,959
Take the adulterer back to the punishments department

405
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,160
Torture

406
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,920
Yue, you have to hold on for a while

407
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,520
A Yue

408
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,400
Zhou Yue

409
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,040
A Yue

410
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,319
Come on, come on, get up, get up, get up

411
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:20,719
What for

412
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,120
Get up

413
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,680
Hide quickly

414
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,000
Why do you want to hide

415
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,479
The bride was caught by Xianggong when she started

416
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,599
Date and drink with strange men

417
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,680
What can I say if I get kicked out of my house? I

418
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
Who is dating you

419
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,160
I can't tell

420
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:33,839
What are you doing

421
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,760
Down

422
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,400
Down

423
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,719
I am a man

424
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,160
Is there any reason to climb over the wall and cross the window

425
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,839
How can you be such a brain-dead person

426
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,160
I thought you told me to go undercover at Chow's

427
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,760
If I am found out and kicked out,

428
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,280
Your intrigues of what you don't know

429
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,120
But you can't finish it

430
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,079
You get down here

431
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
Hurry up

432
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,439
Wait a minute

433
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,120
You hurry up

434
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
What's the rush

435
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,719
You get down there

436
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,359
What a mess

437
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,520
You guys

438
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
You really cuckolded Ayue

439
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,319
King King, why is he here

440
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,680
Jingjingjing

441
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,719
I can't believe I'm here

442
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,760
Lady makes me easy to find

443
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:30,959
Big nephew

444
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,760
What's the problem? Tell your aunt

445
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,400
Why don't you think about it

446
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,839
Big nephew

447
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,599
He's your big nephew

448
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,400
He is my eldest nephew

449
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,559
I'm not her big nephew

450
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,199
You are my big nephew

451
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,439
What's the matter with you

452
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,839
I won't lend you any money

453
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,479
Don't you even recognize me as an aunt

454
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,479
It's your family's decline

455
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Money is in great need now

456
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,160
But you should also understand

457
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,920
Xianggong and I are two of a kind

458
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,319
Although people are rich,

459
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,400
But I don't want him to do this

460
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,640
Where do I have money for you

461
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,559
Is it

462
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,120
Then what is this

463
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,319
When did I save it? How can I forget it

464
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,719
Okay, you big cock

465
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,640
You do the first day and I do the fifteenth day

466
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,479
Come on, hurt each other

467
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,400
Xianggong

468
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,920
I won't hide it from you now

469
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,839
Actually, my eldest nephew came to see me today

470
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,040
Not just to borrow money

471
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,640
As you know, I have a little knowledge of medicine

472
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,599
He actually came to me to see the disease

473
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,880
To see a disease

474
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,599
That's right

475
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,280
Don't look at his model

476
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,280
Actually

477
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,319
Incapable of personnel

478
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,920
What

479
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,959
My eldest nephew's family is a single biography of nine generations

480
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,680
In order to show him this disease, the family

481
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,199
Have spent all their savings

482
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,040
I really can't bear it either

483
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,239
I had to recognize him here

484
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,439
Xianggong

485
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,120
You don't blame me, do you

486
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,359
A relative

487
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,040
Nature should watch and help each other

488
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:56,959
Big

489
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,079
If the big nephew has difficulties,

490
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,280
Why don't you just come to me

491
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,640
That's right

492
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,719
Madam

493
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,439
Tall man

494
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,520
Is to ask about the fire case

495
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,000
Ask

496
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm a little tired. You ask my big nephew

497
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,239
So this one

498
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,319
Big nephew

499
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:22,000
It is said that Your Excellency killed all the assassins

500
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,400
Not a single person was left alive

501
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,719
Now that tall people have

502
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,839
The investigation is so clear

503
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,359
Why come here to ask

504
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,040
Then let's talk to you two

505
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,520
Xianggong, let's go home first

506
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:51,839
Why on earth is she with King Jing

507
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,439
Xianggong

508
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,839
Why do you keep looking at me

509
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Is there something you're not telling me

510
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,800
I'm sorry, Xianggong

511
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,479
I really have something to hide from you

512
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,319
What is it

513
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,520
I was telling you

514
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,000
There is no one at home anymore

515
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,599
Because I'm afraid of madam

516
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,199
Won't choose me to be your wife

517
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,199
But now

518
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,280
There is another sick nephew

519
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,199
But you can rest assured

520
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,559
I already gave him the money

521
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,319
He won't bother us again

522
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,680
Let it be

523
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,239
We have three rooms

524
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,920
Have no official position

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,400
Second, do not participate in government affairs

526
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,719
The money at home

527
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,319
Jing Wang is coveted

528
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,040
I won't wait until today

529
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,640
And my daughter's body problem

530
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,199
It has no conflict of interest with Jingwang

531
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,680
Even if he has a purpose to contact Shen Yu

532
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,160
Presumably

533
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,880
It's also fine with my three rooms

534
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,000
Just let him go

535
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:00,959
Xianggong

536
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:03,959
Xianggong

537
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,000
It's almost to Beijing

538
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,559
Let me tell you something, too

539
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,719
Interests in Zhou Houfu

540
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,040
Why do you tell me Hou Fu

541
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,199
What are you talking about

542
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,800
It's okay, you say

543
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,239
Who on earth is it

544
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,880
So ill-intentioned

545
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,199
Right now

546
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,319
It is the imperial clan's choice of storage

547
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
In addition to this king

548
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,040
Other captains were assassinated

549
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,239
Isn't this idea obvious

550
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,760
What do you mean is

551
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,040
Related to storage selection

552
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,719
Not just this time

553
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,199
Perhaps the Xiaorong Wang case of that year

554
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,880
It is also related to this

555
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,920
Xiao Rong Wang

556
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,079
Xiao Rong Wang

557
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:54,920
Is it from Gao Guifei, the aunt of a tall man

558
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,400
It is also the only heir of the emperor now

559
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,319
Is the perfect candidate for the crown prince

560
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,559
I want to come now

561
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
Without the Xiaorongwang case of that year,

562
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Presumably today's political situation

563
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,359
It's another situation

564
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,400
Especially your Gaos

565
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,680
It won't be like today

566
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,760
Entrust one's destiny to others

567
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,319
But this sinner

568
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,079
Gu Survival, Ambassador of Taiyuan Hospital, and others

569
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,559
Didn't you already fall into the law

570
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,839
Imperial doctor

571
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,599
What's the motive for murdering the emperor's heir

572
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,079
It's just that someone wanted to use a knife to kill people

573
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,319
Take advantage of the emperor's grief to close the case hastily

574
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,599
That your highness thought

575
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,400
Who did it

576
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:35,719
It depends on

577
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,839
In this imperial clan selection,

578
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,479
Who benefits the most

579
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,359
King Ning

580
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:50,040
But he is the holy brother

581
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,160
Always humble and kind

582
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,520
Don't believe in being straight, you must guard against benevolence and heartlessness

583
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,599
Maybe we all come to the same goal

584
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,599
The real head of the Zhou family

585
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,120
It's Mrs. Zhou

586
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,239
Your first grandmother

587
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,479
The old lady comes from a family

588
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,880
It's in the inner courtyard of the deep house

589
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,199
Fighting all the way here

590
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,680
Deep scheming

591
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,359
My mother is soft and soft

592
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,520
You are in the mansion

593
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,520
She must not be bullied

594
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,520
Don't worry, Xianggong

595
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,640
Gentle and virtuous at home and domineering at abroad

596
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,319
Your lady, I just have two faces

597
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,160
One more thing

598
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,839
Whether the old lady is coerced or lured,

599
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:37,719
Never promise her to take me a concubine

600
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:38,719
Do you understand

601
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,160
Good

602
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,239
You have your difficulties

603
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,400
I understand

604
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,640
I said the owner

605
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,079
What kind of clothes do you have

606
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,640
I don't care

607
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,160
This parrot dress tomorrow

608
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,880
Change it for yourself

609
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,520
It's so ugly

610
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,959
I agreed to flaunt myself to Beijing

611
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,880
Let people know that I'm here for storage

612
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,319
You don't dress like this

613
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,479
How can people notice it

614
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,079
You are the one who wants to show off, not me

615
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,120
Why should I wear it

616
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,280
It's so ugly

617
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,800
Ugly

618
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,559
Isn't this quite festive

619
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,280
The main reason is that this king doesn't have your temperament

620
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,520
Can't wear the essence of this suit

621
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,239
Don't give me this set

622
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,479
Sincerely

623
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,199
That's right

624
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,359
You and that little lady

625
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,559
How's it going

626
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,199
What's going on

627
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,079
Don't play dumb

628
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:48,120
I was alone in the same room for so long yesterday

629
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,359
You have to say that there is nothing personal to talk about

630
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,719
Maybe you guys are sweethearts in the room

631
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,959
Han Zhenyun

632
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,640
In your head

633
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,439
What do you think all day long

634
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,160
Don't you ever think about it

635
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,040
By her birth

636
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,680
Can marry into Houmen

637
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,559
She shouldn't have seized the opportunity

638
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,120
Are you seated in the housewife's position

639
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,880
Why did you promise to be a spy

640
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,120
Do you really think Zhou Yue is sincere in marrying her

641
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,680
It's just a temporary fill-up

642
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,319
I think she also understands this very well

643
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,359
That's why I always leave myself behind

644
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,199
As for whether it is true or not

645
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,199
Just give it a try and you'll know

646
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,800
How to try

647
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,400
Nature is to go to Zhou's house to try

648
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,400
The Zhou family has been at ease for too long

649
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,079
Let's go

650
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,040
Drive

651
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,680
Drive

652
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,400
My niece Xu Shi has met three aunts

653
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,400
It's Saburo's daughter-in-law

654
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,640
Thank you for waiting for a long time

655
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,160
The old lady has been chanting since she got up this morning

656
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,920
Unfortunately, I had a headache at noon

657
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,719
Mother is also unwell

658
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
He told me to come out and wait for you

659
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,359
Don't blame three aunts

660
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,120
Naturally, the old lady's body is urgent

661
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,839
This is your fifth brother's daughter-in-law

662
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,439
Third sister-in-law

663
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,520
Third sister-in-law

664
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,400
Five brothers

665
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:39,199
Sister-in-law

666
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,559
Three aunts please

667
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,120
Old lady

668
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,400
Look at me

669
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,319
Are you going out to meet me

670
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,760
Don't have to

671
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,640
How dare they go against my will

672
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,199
Marry the fifth child privately

673
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,880
You should know that there is today

674
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,640
I heard that she is just an orphan girl who runs the rivers and lakes

675
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,800
This origin

676
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,800
Even the handmaid in your house is inferior

677
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,439
How dare you bring it into our Houfu gate

678
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,640
Back to the old lady

679
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,000
The third grandmother took the fifth young master and the fifth young grandmother

680
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,239
Come to greet you

681
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,199
Three aunts please

682
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:06,359
Watch the steps

683
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,000
This is the old lady's Shoukang Hospital

684
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,280
Now my mother and my sister Yi Hui

685
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,319
They are all in the room with the old lady

686
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,199
Please

687
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,280
Everybody get up

688
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,520
Received the letter the previous month

689
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,760
Said Goro was ill

690
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,319
Hurry to a letter

691
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,199
Let you come to Beijing for medical treatment

692
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,520
Who expected to receive the letter again

693
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,400
Said the disease was cured

694
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,319
There is one more person around here

695
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,079
Looks like it

696
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,199
It's because we have too many things

697
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,239
It's grandchildren's fault that worries grandmother

698
00:31:58,719 --> 00:31:59,719
Back to the old lady

699
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,640
Ayue came back from study tour

700
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,839
I originally planned to leave for Beijing with my family

701
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,239
Have no idea

702
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,000
Sagging corners of the mouth

703
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Eye whiteness

704
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,959
It's hard to get along with at first sight

705
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:11,880
That big cock

706
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
And let me be her intimate person

707
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,760
It seems that it will take some trouble

708
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,280
Celebrate him

709
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,839
Sure enough

710
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,680
The new daughter-in-law entered the door

711
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,280
A Yue's illness was really cured

712
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,800
It's not all my credit

713
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,880
Mainly our Hou Fu

714
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,160
Be blessed by heaven

715
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,120
Old lady, you

716
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,479
And kind-hearted and amiable

717
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,800
Our children and grandchildren

718
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,280
It's all your blessings

719
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,880
Yeah, too

720
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:45,800
The three rooms have long been separated

721
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,800
About Goro

722
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,000
Naturally, you will

723
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,839
Don't ask me what I mean

724
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,920
I wanted to ask the old lady to choose a good relative

725
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:59,920
It's just that Ayue's illness came too suddenly

726
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,680
There was really no good way at that time

727
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,000
How old is this girl

728
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
How dare you not answer your grandmother's question

729
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,359
Are you asking me

730
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,959
I am clearly Goro's daughter-in-law

731
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,040
The old lady said it was a girl

732
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:27,920
Old lady

733
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,359
You are asking my grandson's daughter-in-law

734
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,800
Her rules

735
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,640
Third daughter-in-law

736
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,920
Is it time for you to teach, too

737
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:41,680
Yes

738
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,079
Old lady

739
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,839
The old lady asks you a question

740
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,439
Just answer it.

741
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,479
We old ladies

742
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,880
But the famous benevolent people in Beijing

743
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,920
It won't embarrass you

744
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,680
What Xianggong said is naturally right

745
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,160
A Yu wrote it down

746
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:26,880
My Royal Highness

747
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,559
Invitation from Ning Wangfu

748
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
Why don't you go in first

749
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,640
Ning Wang's action is quite fast

750
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,040
To be expected

751
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,479
He is a soldier before a ceremony

752
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,839
Be an enemy or a friend

753
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
It depends on the changing situation

754
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,640
Now he has been targeted by the punishments department

755
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,040
And I have entered Beijing

756
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,640
In order to clear the suspicion, he

757
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,559
Only posturing

758
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,079
So are we going or not

759
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,040
Your mind is harder to guess than a girl

760
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,359
Jingwangfu has not been repaired yet

761
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
We're not staying at this inn, are we

762
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,319
I'm tired of running all the way

763
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,079
I also want a high bed and soft pillow

764
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,719
I can't eat so much pain

765
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,359
Don't worry

766
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,400
There will naturally be people then

767
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,599
Delicious and delicious for us

768
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,479
Where

769
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,640
You'll know when you get there

770
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,439
It is said that this Shen Shi

771
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:22,079
She is an orphan girl who runs the rivers and lakes

772
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,400
With her origins

773
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,239
After all, it is wronged Goro

774
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,160
But Houmen disciples have three wives and four concubines

775
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,959
That's a common occurrence

776
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,040
Grandma will pay close attention to you in the future

777
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,000
Just add a few more rooms

778
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,000
What the old lady said is

779
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:42,319
Our Zhou Fu people are thin

780
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,719
Be sure to spread more branches and leaves

781
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,280
Xiao Xianggong is really worried

782
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,000
They will echo each other as soon as I come in here

783
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,279
Talk about concubinage

784
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,120
Think of me as a decoration

785
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,319
Thank grandmother and aunt for their kindness

786
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,799
It's just that Ayue is not wronged

787
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,759
A few days ago, the post station caught fire

788
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,440
Thanks to the fish risking his life to save him

789
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,440
It's lucky to marry like this

790
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Don't bother your grandmother to ask for a concubine any more

791
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:15,759
Yeah

792
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,240
A Yu gave his life to save his husband

793
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
Such a righteous woman

794
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:23,480
In our Suzhou

795
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,400
That is to go to the government Shenli Archway

796
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,599
If so soon

797
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:30,120
He took a concubine and added a house

798
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,079
I'm afraid it will cool people's hearts

799
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,960
I just want Goro's side

800
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,400
Multi-individual person

801
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,599
I didn't say I would do it now

802
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,079
You mother and son are so evasive

803
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,279
It seems that my old lady is unreasonable

804
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:49,559
Grandchildren dare not

805
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,799
It's just that the fire is still fresh in my mind

806
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:53,999
Grandchildren

807
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,519
I am also afraid that outsiders will laugh at my Zhou family cool thin

808
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Which is as complicated as the five brothers thought

809
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,920
Who cares about the little thing in the post station

810
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,200
It is a trivial matter to give your life to save your husband

811
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,680
Then what's a big deal

812
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,480
Why don't you teach me, sister

813
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,480
You

814
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Fish to save me

815
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,519
I really hurt myself

816
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,400
It's really not easy to travel all the way

817
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:16,440
It is not advisable to stand for a long time

818
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,400
I hope grandma will forgive me

819
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,880
Where is the red face like hurting your body?

820
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,039
Grandma, she clearly

821
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:24,559
That's enough

822
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,759
Goro

823
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,759
You have traveled all the way

824
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,240
It's all exhausted

825
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,079
Go down and settle down for a rest

826
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,759
Yes

827
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:38,359
Old lady

828
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:51,519
You guys go down

829
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,720
Yes

830
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Why don't you go down, too

831
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,519
A Yue still has some discomfort

832
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,200
Why don't you stay in the wing for the time being

833
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,680
It was still sunny just now

834
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,279
It will be a cold winter

835
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,480
The Zhou family is really difficult to serve

836
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:17,319
Good

837
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,759
Mother

838
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,400
Weren't you there just now

839
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,880
Do you praise her in front of the old lady

840
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,880
Why is this worrying

841
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,599
It's always necessary to pretend

842
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:33,640
Just now

843
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,720
I watched her contradict the old lady

844
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,680
It really scares me to death

845
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,880
My heart

846
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,240
I still jump plop plop plop

847
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,559
I'm really afraid she won't stay in the house soon

848
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,400
Wasted all our thoughts

849
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,200
As long as the official donation is done

850
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:50,319
Release from Beijing

851
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,079
You can leave these twists and turns

852
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,759
I hope so

853
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,640
Father

854
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,160
Father

855
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,839
Qi Zhang, the villager in Shan Ye

856
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,160
Really don't put our Ning Wangfu in the eye

857
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,599
The invitation was sent back intact

858
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,359
To be expected

859
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,680
If you come,

860
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,519
This king felt strange

861
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,279
No

862
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,999
Then what invitation did you give him back

863
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,599
That's not a vain brush to Ning Wangfu's face

864
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,920
The assassination

865
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,160
The punishments department has targeted

866
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,599
Points to our Ning Wangfu

867
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,519
Send invitations to Qi Zhang

868
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,039
Even if he doesn't come

869
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,279
This matter has already caused a lot of wind and rain in the city

870
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:10,039
So

871
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,759
This is just to get rid of suspicion

872
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:13,920
It's just posturing

873
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,519
One who knows me

874
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:16,999
Sickle Er Ye

875
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,279
No

876
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,440
Why bother

877
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,519
If you ask me, just do another assassination

878
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,039
Kill, kill, kill

879
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,680
You just know how to kill

880
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,599
I've already failed once

881
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:29,999
Don't

882
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,759
Do you want to leave more evidence for others

883
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,680
That doesn't make people think that

884
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,799
Let's Ning Wangfu

885
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,079
Afraid of that Shan Ye village man

886
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:41,599
Father

887
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,880
I think

888
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,079
If you can't get rid of it for the time being,

889
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,680
It's better to turn enemies into friends first

890
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,720
Above the court

891
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,279
The situation is changing

892
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,799
Today is the enemy

893
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,680
Tomorrow may be a best friend

894
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,039
This king knows this truth

895
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:04,120
Can he Qi Zhang not know clearly

896
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,319
You

897
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,480
Learn more from your brother

898
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,640
Let me learn from a lowly bastard

899
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,240
What are you talking about

900
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,519
Father is not to blame

901
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,999
How can I be compare with my brother

902
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,720
My younger brother has a noble status

903
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:26,799
That is the best choice for the imperial clan in the future

904
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,759
Someday

905
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,599
Will be able to inherit the grand unification

906
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,759
Remain famous in history

907
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,519
Speaking of this matter of choosing storage,

908
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,279
This king feels strange

909
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:41,079
This Qi Zhang has always been hiding from the world

910
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,999
Why did you come to Beijing with great fanfare this time

911
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,559
My father suspected that he had a different purpose

912
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,680
No matter what his purpose is,

913
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,359
You send someone to keep an eye on him

914
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,120
The matter of storage

915
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,400
There must be no mishap

916
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,480
Boy obeys

917
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,759
Don't dress up as a pig and eat a tiger here

918
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,680
Dad eats you like this

919
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm not eating

920
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,440
I am warning you

921
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,599
I am the first son of Ning Wangfu

922
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,680
Don't try to crush me

923
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:37,839
My brother laughed

924
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,999
How can a pheasant be on a par with a phoenix

925
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,279
Be a brother

926
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
I just want to be rich and idle all my life

927
00:43:11,279 --> 00:43:12,039
Shen Shi

928
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:15,359
Although there are many rules in Zhou Fu,

929
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,279
Three or five months

930
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,120
I just remember it

931
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:21,279
You just came to Zhou Fu

932
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,279
Is there anything I don't understand

933
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,519
You can ask at any time

934
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,599
Make yourself at home

935
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:28,999
What the old lady said is

936
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:30,559
You're young

937
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,999
There are still many days to study in the future

938
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,200
You go along with everything the old lady says

939
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:37,960
This will be a tribute

940
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,480
It's a pity that you don't go to the teahouse to tell books

941
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,640
Don't you just want me to back down

942
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:43,799
Think beautifully

943
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,999
After that

944
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,120
Do you really want grandmother and aunt

945
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,640
Help a lot

946
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,039
You are so kind to me

947
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:53,319
As long as I live in Zhou's house for one day,

948
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:55,359
I will definitely accompany you to the end

949
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:56,920
I will definitely not break my promise

950
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
It's time for soup

951
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,400
Shen Shi, bring the soup

952
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,680
Stop

953
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,720
Quick chase

954
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:43,160
Stop

955
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,960
Don't run

956
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:06,799
He can't run far

957
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:07,720
Chase

958
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,559
Chase

959
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,799
This way

960
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:21,559
Stop

961
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,680
You're badly hurt

962
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,559
This barren hill

963
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,079
So I can save you

964
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:26,039
One hundred and twenty don't bargain

965
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,359
OK, I'll do it

966
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:32,240
Come
