1
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,000
Lord Joe

2
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,400
This week, my youngest daughter died

3
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,319
Who is the bride

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,920
Who is the bride

5
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
Just look at it

6
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,399
Ben Wang wants to see it

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,040
What are you up to

8
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,559
A fish

9
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
You

10
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,599
Why are you here

11
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,840
Yi Hui

12
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,000
Ask you what you say

13
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,800
Fish, why are you here

14
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:36,960
A fish

15
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,079
Say it

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,439
What's wrong with you

17
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,480
Say something

18
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,399
A Yu is not in the right situation

19
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,439
What's wrong with your highness

20
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,039
Sickle

21
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,800
What on earth have you done

22
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,719
What can I do

23
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,399
It's King Jing, you

24
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,039
In order to marry the remnants of the family,

25
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,639
Do not hesitate to steal days and change days

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,520
Kill Miss Zhou Jiasan

27
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,480
You know that this marriage is a gift from the Holy Spirit

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,120
But it's still the same

29
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,759
You

30
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,480
Where to put the Holy One

31
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,079
With the emperor's love for King Jing,

32
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,280
Jing Wang Ruo is dissatisfied with marriage

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,759
Just say it to the emperor

34
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,920
It is impossible to go to the point of killing people

35
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,200
Among them

36
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,679
There must be something strange

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,920
King Jing got married under the guise of marriage

38
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,039
Have already put the Qinbing of Yongzhou

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,719
Pretend to be a businessman who gives gifts

40
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,120
Blend into the capital

41
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,359
The captaincy led his troops into Beijing without permission

42
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:38,439
Tall man

43
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,679
You tell me what his purpose will be

44
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,240
Why did you kill my daughter

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,840
She wants to marry you with all her heart and soul

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,519
And you sent her to hell

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,159
Why are you so cruel

48
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,000
Aunt

49
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,360
And you

50
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,720
Mrs. Zhou

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,720
This king didn't kill Yi Hui

52
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,399
But Yihui did die because of me

53
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,360
If you have any complaints, come to this king.

54
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,200
Big aunt A Yu is virtuous

55
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,840
King Jing is aboveboard

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,840
They will never because of their own selfish interests

57
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Killing Yihui

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,519
You believe us

59
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,560
We'll find out for sure

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,480
Right

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,360
There is something strange about it

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,280
We will definitely investigate it thoroughly

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
Now that it has happened

64
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,840
You guys

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,759
You still protect them

66
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,560
My Yi Hui

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,840
Yi Hui

68
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,480
How

69
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,799
The princess disappeared and the ferry was taken away

70
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,399
Sickle

71
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,519
You put the king's mother

72
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,120
Where did you turn

73
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,239
Yi Hui

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,280
King of Scenery

75
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,920
You gave us a false address on purpose

76
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,200
We had already gone the wrong way

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,039
But who ever thought

78
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,920
The princess jumped off the boat by herself

79
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:15,000
We brought her back again

80
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,799
Ben Wang asked you for the last time

81
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,239
My mother

82
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,159
Where is it now

83
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,239
When you go to death row,

84
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,959
I will tell you naturally

85
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,840
Jing Wang Qi Zhang deceives you and ignores you

86
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,280
Trying to kill people

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,399
National law is difficult to tolerate

88
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,480
Bearer

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Bring him to me before the emperor for punishment

90
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,200
Take it down for me

91
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,840
This king is afraid that you don't have this ability

92
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,000
Soldiers obey orders

93
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,720
Close the gate and no one can go out

94
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,759
Yes

95
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,039
I don't have the ability

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,599
But the emperor has

97
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,239
Our Majesty is polysemous

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
And you put his woman

99
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,199
It was smuggled away

100
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,679
I'm afraid the whole Yongzhou will suffer for this

101
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,840
If you are evasive again,

102
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,479
This king promises that you will suffer now

103
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,600
You can rest assured

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,560
I wouldn't dare offend her

105
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,959
If you want to see her so much,

106
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,760
I'll just bring her here.

107
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,079
How

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,160
The emperor is assured

109
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,880
King Ning has sent his princess

110
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,560
Intercepted at Dongdu Estuary

111
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,199
This Qi Zhang

112
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,359
I

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
He was too indulged in the past

114
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,079
He dared to take advantage of the big wedding

115
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,399
To do such a thing

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,479
The emperor has one more thing

117
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,440
Say

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,239
Talk about the return of the minister of punishments

119
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:12,320
King Jing killed his wife who had never been to the door

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,600
Miss Zhou Jiasan Zhou Yihui

121
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,280
Mother

122
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,760
How come you're back

123
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,280
Zhang Er

124
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:29,560
Mother knows that you are filial and faithful

125
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,079
Want to bring my mother back to Yongzhou

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,399
But have you ever thought about it

127
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,679
What if you do

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,239
It will definitely offend Longyan

129
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,040
Mother never wanted to

130
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
Let you risk for your mother

131
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Children are not afraid

132
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,600
Mother

133
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Father is looking for you

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,880
Died in the capital

135
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,239
It is also my father's last wish to take you back to Yongzhou

136
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,320
If that man insists on stopping

137
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,199
The child will not hesitate to meet his sword and soldier

138
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,840
Can't

139
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,199
You are now the Lord of Yongzhou

140
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,679
If you attack the emperor,

141
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,760
That is the traitor and thief

142
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,079
Such a big crime

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
You can't afford it

144
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,880
Man is famous after death

145
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,199
The child doesn't care

146
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,399
Not to mention that once you kill the king,

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
That is the unfaithful and unfilial courtiers

148
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,199
It will be scourged by heaven

149
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,239
What does mother mean by this

150
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't hide you anymore

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,840
In fact, your father and I were

152
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,959
When I returned to Yongzhou,

153
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,479
I'm pregnant

154
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,519
Today's emperor

155
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,120
Is your biological father

156
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,160
How

157
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,239
You know

158
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,239
Children don't know and don't want to know

159
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,760
Mother

160
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,040
Grace is not as good as grace

161
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,160
He imprisoned my mother and killed my father

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,799
This enmity is sworn

163
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,399
You just listen to the child

164
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,160
How about going back to Yongzhou

165
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,320
Zhang Er

166
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,479
His Royal Highness King Jing

167
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,479
If you have anything to say to the command, please

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,639
Sickle

169
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,639
Are you entitled to hold me

170
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,720
What the hell is going on

171
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,399
Report to the Emperor

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,840
King Jing used the name of marriage

173
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,399
Go to Beijing as a business traveler with Yongzhou Qinbing

174
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,799
Desire to plot evil

175
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:58,959
Emperor

176
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,040
King Jing is dissatisfied with the marriage given by the holy man

177
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,440
Killing Miss Zhou Jiasan Zhou Yihui

178
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,560
He defied the imperial power and acted recklessly

179
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,359
Please ask the emperor to make a holy ruling

180
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,479
Qi Zhang

181
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,440
What's your excuse

182
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,839
If you want to add sin, you can't get away with it

183
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,440
You're admitting it

184
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,359
I'm just going up and down.

185
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,960
What do you mean

186
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,279
I taught you to lead your troops to seek rebellion

187
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,080
It's me

188
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,960
Teach you to kill your wife for righteousness

189
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,120
Is it

190
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,760
Emperor

191
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,640
Do you really want me to say it in front of everyone

192
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,120
Sure

193
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,120
You said

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,359
I'd like to hear it

195
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,839
Your mouth

196
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,080
What kind of disobedient words can you spit out

197
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,440
Good

198
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,880
Dare to ask the emperor

199
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,239
Why do you want to imprison my mother and kill my father

200
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,400
Who

201
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,320
Teach you to say these things

202
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,039
Who

203
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,080
Let you say these things

204
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,599
No one needs to tell me

205
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,799
Cool breeze and bright moon

206
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,359
The truth is hidden between heaven and earth

207
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,520
You can cheat me and cheat my mother

208
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,200
Deceive thousands of people who have opened up

209
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,359
But you can't deceive the gods

210
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,039
You can't hide from Yamaraja in the ten halls

211
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,479
There will always be retribution when justice is clear

212
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,960
Good

213
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:57,960
Inverted

214
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,400
Inverted

215
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,520
Inverted

216
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,919
How dare you curse me

217
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,279
You are going against the law

218
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,159
I

219
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,440
I will cut you down with my own hands

220
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,760
Total victory

221
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,560
Bring me my sword

222
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Bring a sword

223
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,080
Your Majesty, calm down

224
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,200
Ancestral training of all dynasties is a vein of Taizu

225
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
No matter what heinous crimes you have committed,

226
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,080
You can't kill them

227
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,799
Do not kill

228
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,719
Your Majesty, calm down

229
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,359
Qi Zhang

230
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,159
I can't kill you today

231
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,080
Good bearer

232
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,039
Demote Qi Zhang to the common people

233
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,560
Exile for three thousand miles

234
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,080
If there is a intercessor,

235
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,760
Chop without forgiveness

236
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,760
Yes

237
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,679
Minister

238
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,560
Thank the Emperor

239
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,200
Emperor

240
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,640
Emperor

241
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,520
Quickly

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,039
Chuan Tai Yi

243
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,359
This girl

244
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,960
Sealed by silver needles, the whole body blood vessels

245
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,799
That's why you are at the mercy of others

246
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,719
Is that a big deal

247
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:31,719
It's all right now

248
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,440
Just take a short rest

249
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,919
Thank you, Langzhong

250
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:39,919
Thank you

251
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,320
Fish, you're awake

252
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,120
A Yue

253
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,599
A Yue

254
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,599
How is he

255
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,520
You can rest assured

256
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,200
The emperor loves His Royal Highness King Jing

257
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,880
It won't embarrass him

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,120
Gao Mo went to the punishments department

259
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,479
You'll let us know as soon as something happens

260
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,919
I'm afraid it's not that simple this time

261
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,039
Then what the hell happened

262
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,599
How did the bride become you

263
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,679
Didn't you leave a letter saying

264
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,560
Are you leaving the capital

265
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
I don't know either

266
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,120
Last night

267
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,719
When I wake up again,

268
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,960
I'm already in the sedan chair

269
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,880
Wearing bridal clothes

270
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,719
I don't know who tied me up

271
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,440
But

272
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,919
I heard Helanya's voice

273
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,719
Although she was sealed all over the meridians,

274
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,520
But be more careful

275
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,839
Don't make a mistake

276
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,679
Don't worry

277
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,880
It turned out to be Helanya

278
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,719
Why is she so vicious

279
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,159
It's me she hates

280
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,239
But why kill Yi Hui

281
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,599
How's Gao Mo

282
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,719
What happened to him? What happened to him

283
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,159
His Royal Highness King Jing was demoted to the common people

284
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,919
Send out exile for 3,000 miles

285
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,080
General Han was also sent to a bitter and cold place

286
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,239
At this time, I am already on my way out of Beijing

287
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,479
Distribution

288
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,359
How can this happen

289
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,000
A fish

290
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,440
You can't go

291
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,599
I must go to Ayue

292
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,200
You can't go

293
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,919
It doesn't change anything if you go now

294
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,039
I know how hard the road to exile is

295
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,400
How painful it is

296
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,279
Even if I can't change anything

297
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,679
At least I can stay with him

298
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll be worried if you do this

299
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,159
I have to go. Don't stop me, Yue

300
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm with you

301
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
You can't go

302
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,200
The Zhou family still needs you

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,599
Besides

304
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,320
You have to find Helanya

305
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,039
Find out the state of things

306
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,960
Wash away grievances for Qi Zhang

307
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,279
It's all up to you

308
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,000
Madam

309
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,560
Don't you change this lantern

310
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,479
Yi Hui likes

311
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,120
Keep it

312
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,199
The medicine is too bitter to take off

313
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,640
Life is bitter

314
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,479
Grandma has experienced decades of wind and frost

315
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,800
Such suffering

316
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,400
How can you not swallow

317
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:15,239
You came to see me laugh

318
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
Incineration of fingers and heart pain

319
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,839
No amount of beware of suspicion

320
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,520
In the face of life and death

321
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,359
It's not worth mentioning

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,680
Close the door

323
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,479
Zhou's family

324
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,120
Is connected by blood

325
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,599
What a sin

326
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,439
Grandmother

327
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,599
If

328
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,479
If it weren't for my lust for imperial power and wealth in those days

329
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,520
Cheating Zhou You to go home hurt her life

330
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,199
There will never be today's result

331
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,319
Now and now

332
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Yi Hui

333
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:24,520
Died of Qi Zhang

334
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,839
What a retribution

335
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,880
What a retribution

336
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,680
It's all my fault

337
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,400
Yi Hui He Gu

338
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,199
Yi Hui He Gu

339
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,199
Grandmother

340
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,079
Goro

341
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,359
Grandma, I'm here

342
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,239
Our Zhou family

343
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,400
I can't stand any more wind and frost

344
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,719
Grandmother

345
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,599
What are you looking for

346
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,000
Where are my beads

347
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,239
To

348
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,880
Henceforth

349
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,520
I want to go to Buddha day by day

350
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,680
Confess my mistakes to Buddha

351
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,079
Let Yihui go with peace of mind

352
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,719
Let her go with peace of mind

353
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,359
Grandmother

354
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,319
Yue wants to confess something to you

355
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,079
Actually, Ayue

356
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,760
It's a daughter

357
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,920
Dad is so kind

358
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,880
Qi Zhang's stumbling block was finally removed

359
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,319
It's not easy to sit back and relax now

360
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,800
Unless that Qi Zhang

361
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:07,520
Completely disappear from this world

362
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,400
No

363
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,239
He was exiled

364
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,400
Dad, what do you have to worry about

365
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,719
Qi Zhang's generation is by no means idle

366
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,120
He will not die for a day

367
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:29,359
As a father, you can't feel at ease for a day

368
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,680
Leave people behind. You can get out of here

369
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,239
Qi Zhang, you lost

370
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,079
This king is not dead yet

371
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,000
Now on winning or losing

372
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,760
Isn't it too early

373
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,040
Your time has come

374
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Unexpected

375
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,160
Always defiant

376
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,040
The omnipotent King of Northwest Scenery

377
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,599
Will fall into this field

378
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,000
Come again

379
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,040
Qi Zhang

380
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,239
You are really a good opponent

381
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,559
But you shouldn't be in my way

382
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,000
Be an enemy of me

383
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,239
Be the opponent of this king

384
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,959
You don't deserve it

385
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
Find death

386
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,920
A fish

387
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,439
Don't be afraid I'm coming

388
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,160
What's the use of you coming

389
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,559
Come to be buried with you

390
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,439
Don't you dare hurt Qi Zhang

391
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,120
I absolutely want your life

392
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,599
Qi Zun Mo poisoned his family

393
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,040
I can't believe you still protect him

394
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,599
That's a matter for both of us

395
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,599
It's really deep in love and heavy in righteousness

396
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,400
Good

397
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,680
I have fulfilled you today

398
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,040
You poisoned

399
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,640
I dare to come alone when I can't beat you

400
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,599
Guess why

401
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
I'll kill you

402
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
This poison is called Huagu Powder

403
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,680
Slow movement of qi and blood

404
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
I can still hold on to a column of incense

405
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,920
But if luck kills people,

406
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,199
You definitely died before us

407
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,000
If you don't believe me, try it

408
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,280
It's almost a pity

409
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:49,719
No hindrance

410
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,640
Why

411
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,520
Don't go to the last thatched cottage

412
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
That's too close

413
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,479
If Qi Lian is found to have been cheated,

414
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,439
Will definitely catch up

415
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Be cheated

416
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,839
Are you saying the poison is fake

417
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,719
I came out in a hurry

418
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,400
How can you carry deadly poison with you

419
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,319
So risky

420
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,199
What if he just found out

421
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,359
See through it. It's a big deal to die together

422
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,520
Shen fish

423
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,120
I

424
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,640
All right

425
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,719
Let's find a place to stay first

426
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,040
I'm hurting you

427
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,760
No pain

428
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,400
Always say I love to lie

429
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,079
If you tell a lie, you will come with your mouth open

430
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,400
The sword wound on your back is too serious

431
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,599
Let me clean it up for you

432
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,239
No harm

433
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,280
I'll do it myself

434
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:19,479
What for

435
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,079
I'm afraid I'll kill you for revenge

436
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,479
If so

437
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,040
Wouldn't it be best

438
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,719
Take off your clothes

439
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,719
Take it off

440
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,719
That day

441
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,400
Why did you appear in the auditorium

442
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,880
I was knocked out by someone

443
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,479
I took it away after sealing the acupuncture points

444
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Do you know that

445
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
Who killed Chou Yi-hui

446
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,680
It should be Helanya

447
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,160
Seems

448
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,559
They're trying to use Chow's death

449
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
To frame you

450
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,079
I would never

451
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,359
Let them succeed

452
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:04,920
Emperor

453
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,280
Here she comes

454
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,920
You all go down

455
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:14,280
Yes

456
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,359
Let's all go down

457
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,640
Zhang Er

458
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,040
I would never kill Yi Hui

459
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,319
I won't lead my troops to rebel

460
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:51,640
You know that

461
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,280
Ayou

462
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
Qi Zhang

463
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,719
I want to take advantage of my wedding

464
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,680
Take you away from me

465
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,839
It is already an unforgivable sin

466
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,640
So you have to exile him for thousands of miles

467
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,719
What are you doing

468
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,319
Do you know that

469
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,800
Leave the capital

470
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,839
Everywhere is the gate of hell

471
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,839
You're his real father

472
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:25,760
Are you going to kill your own son with your own hands

473
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:26,920
I

474
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,239
There is no way

475
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,239
You have

476
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,800
All you care about is your dignity

477
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,800
You are like this to Zhang Er

478
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,760
You do the same to Xiao Rong Wang

479
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,599
Ayou

480
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:48,920
Just

481
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:50,760
Just

482
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,040
I am the one who deserves the most punishment

483
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,719
All this is my fault

484
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,280
If it weren't for what happened between me and you

485
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,280
How can this Mo be poisoned

486
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,599
This little king of glory

487
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,520
It will be safe and secure

488
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,680
Everything that followed

489
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,199
It won't even happen

490
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,559
Empress

491
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,920
Handmaiden, come and get it

492
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,239
If it weren't for what happened between me and you

493
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,239
This little king of glory

494
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
It will be safe and secure

495
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,880
Empress

496
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,319
Let's take it from the handmaiden

497
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,120
Go away

498
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,079
Empress

499
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,479
Go away

500
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,880
Why

501
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,000
Why

502
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,800
If, as the fish said,

503
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,599
Yi Hui was already killed when she was abducted

504
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,359
The servant girl Dong Er holds the fake Yihui

505
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,680
She must know

506
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,599
Is winter son bought off

507
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,640
I haven't seen Yi Hui since she was killed

508
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,839
Now it seems that there is another mystery

509
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,520
I sent people to search the whole city

510
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm with you

511
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,239
You want to kill Dong Er

512
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,439
You promised me to keep her alive

513
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,520
I have killed Yi Hui

514
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,079
I can't go wrong again and again

515
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,359
To leave her is to leave evil

516
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,479
We don't have to make extra trouble for ourselves

517
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,760
But

518
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,359
Have a bowl of wonton

519
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,439
Wonton

520
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,719
Have a look

521
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,759
What is this

522
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,559
Where winter is about to appear

523
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,680
Since when do you train spies

524
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,480
It is easy to attract attention with great fanfare

525
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,799
It's better to keep a low profile

526
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,799
We'll look up one by one later

527
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,079
Where are you going

528
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,359
Now

529
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,880
Can't you and I be in the same room

530
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,720
It is inconvenient to be different between men and women

531
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,120
Do you really hate me so much

532
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,359
I'm sorry

533
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,039
Qi Zhang

534
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,400
You're not sorry for me

535
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:46,999
I never believed it either

536
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,440
The theory that the father pays the debt and the son pays the debt

537
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,759
But among us

538
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,960
Through blood

539
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,960
We can't go back

540
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,839
It's cool outside

541
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,680
It's going to rain. It's cold outside

542
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,599
Why don't you come in and sleep

543
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,480
I'm talking to you, Qi Zhang

544
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,999
Men and women are different

545
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,599
Not very convenient

546
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,799
You can leave this alone if you are injured now

547
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,279
I was hurt just now, too

548
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,559
Why should we talk about it

549
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,960
You're mad at me, aren't you

550
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,759
I'm not angry with you

551
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,519
You don't blame me

552
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,200
It is already magnanimous

553
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:44,599
Qi Zhang

554
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,440
I risked my life to save you

555
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,039
You and I are weird

556
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,920
You really think I owe you, don't you

557
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,720
I know you don't owe me anything

558
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,200
And

559
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,079
I didn't ask you to save me either

560
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,999
Then you didn't refuse either

561
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:00,359
Did you give me a chance to refuse

562
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,720
Sleep wherever you like

563
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,839
Don't come to me if you have a fever and inflammation

564
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:10,920
Say no matter what I do

565
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,720
Didn't you come to save me in the end

566
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:18,839
Can I mind my own business today

567
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,799
When I was in Suzhou Mansion,

568
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:21,999
Is to let lard blindfold

569
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:23,480
When I was in the Bronze Bird Building,

570
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,400
You should just walk away

571
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,759
I shouldn't have taken your ill-gotten gains

572
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,759
There should be no intersection between us

573
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:28,160
I

574
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,279
You're not

575
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,839
Did you say it was for Zhou Yihui

576
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,440
I want you to take care of me

577
00:39:58,839 --> 00:39:59,799
I'm not reluctant

578
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:00,999
Don't get me wrong

579
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:39,720
If you don't want to have anything to do with me again,

580
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,079
It's not too late to regret it now

581
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,240
You

582
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,319
I make my own decisions about my own affairs

583
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,759
It's not your business

584
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,839
Where are you going, Donger

585
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,839
Big childe

586
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,160
Why do you suddenly want to send me to the fief of King Ning

587
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:48,920
Word came from the punishments department

588
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,480
They have caught the runaway servant girl

589
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:53,400
Winter son was caught

590
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:55,480
Gao Mo caught it with his own hands

591
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,200
But she hasn't betrayed us yet

592
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,759
So leave as soon as possible

593
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,559
High ink

594
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,039
All right, don't say it yet

595
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,559
You leave Beijing as soon as possible

596
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,920
I'll arrange the rest

597
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,120
Don't worry

598
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,680
Donger is just a little girl

599
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,559
Scare her a few times and confess

600
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,960
Take your time

601
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:33,640
What's the matter

602
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,519
Qi Lian wants to send Helanya away from Beijing

603
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:38,120
They must have known that Dong Er was caught

604
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:39,680
That's why I ran away in a hurry

605
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,640
She must not be allowed to leave

606
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,839
Ning Wang has great power in Beijing

607
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:45,519
It's not good to intercept directly

608
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,559
You wait here for me

609
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,240
I'll go back to the punishments department and assemble my men

610
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,480
Set up checkpoints after they leave the city

611
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,359
Catch them

612
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,519
High ink

613
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,039
No

614
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,559
If Helanya runs away at this time,

615
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:05,039
It's too hard to catch it again
