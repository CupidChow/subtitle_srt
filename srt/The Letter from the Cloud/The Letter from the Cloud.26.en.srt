1
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,720
Brother Emperor

2
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
That seat

3
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
You've been sitting too long

4
00:01:57,921 --> 00:01:58,761
Rest

5
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
All the soldiers listen to orders

6
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,280
Please emigrate the emperor

7
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:06,721
Yes

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Stop them

9
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,760
The emperor's minister's rescue came late

10
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,080
I hope the emperor will forgive me

11
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:19,921
Zhang Er

12
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Just in time

13
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,921
You're not dead

14
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
You're not even dead

15
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
How dare our king die easily

16
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,360
Sickle son command down

17
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Don't bother

18
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
Your little men

19
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,121
It is now fully controlled

20
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm afraid I can't move

21
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,281
Qi Zhang

22
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,241
Entrusted by the emperor

23
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:43,921
Assemble with military symbols

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,400
Southeast Longxi Mobei Southwest Yongzhou

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Five-way military forces went to Beijing to be diligent

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,881
Be fortunate enough to live up to one's life

27
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,320
Now return the soldier symbol to the emperor

28
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:54,800
Good

29
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,160
Original

30
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
This is the bureau you designed

31
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,400
You knew I'd do this

32
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,760
Your wolf ambition

33
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,320
I

34
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,040
How to not know

35
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,960
Slow

36
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:34,960
So

37
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:37,760
You

38
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,081
You and you

39
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,361
Just to set up a game to capture me

40
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,160
Qi Zunyan

41
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,641
You really think highly of me

42
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,960
Qi Zunshu

43
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,880
After all, you and I are brothers and sisters

44
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,800
You give in easily

45
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,400
I won't hurt your life

46
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,520
Hand and foot blood

47
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,760
Why bother when a man lives and dies in He Huan

48
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,600
I don't want your forgiveness

49
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,960
Gao Mo, how dare you hurt my father

50
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,880
I'll kill you

51
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,841
Shell

52
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,040
Qi Zunyan

53
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,960
I forgive you that today is death

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,240
I will never grovel to you again

55
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,561
King Ning

56
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,680
You are a monstrous sinner

57
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,281
Want to die before being judged by the law

58
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:09,841
It's not that easy

59
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,640
Your Majesty, I was wrong. I know I was wrong

60
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:20,080
Ask the emperor to spare my life

61
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,240
Sickle

62
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,960
You spineless thing

63
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,721
Stand up for me

64
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:29,841
Emperor

65
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,520
I don't really want to rebel at all

66
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,200
It's my dad. He made me

67
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,441
Your Majesty, you must believe me

68
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,321
A Yue

69
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:00,881
A fish

70
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,800
Let me go or I'll kill her

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,761
Is it the king's land under the whole world

72
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,281
You can't run away, Qi Lian

73
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:15,761
Emperor Qi Zhang doesn't care about her life

74
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,200
It doesn't matter to you either

75
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,240
Qi Lian, you let the fish go

76
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,640
There is still room for change

77
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:26,200
Your father and son have committed countless crimes

78
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,761
Are you still stubborn

79
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,721
Don't tell me so much nonsense

80
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:33,240
Either let me go or let her bury me with me

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,601
Sickle

82
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,441
You had a chance to live

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,920
It's gone now

84
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,841
Do you want me to kill her

85
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,761
Qi Zhang

86
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:46,841
A fish

87
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,561
If I save you

88
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:51,960
Let go of this traitor and thief

89
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
To live up to the emperor

90
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,240
I live up to these soldiers who fought my life and death

91
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,360
Shame on the people of Qian Qian

92
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,680
Qi Zhang

93
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,200
You worked so hard for her

94
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,520
I don't believe you dare do anything

95
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:13,161
A fish

96
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm sorry

97
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,441
Qi Zhang can't

98
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:39,680
Whichever eye I blink, you turn in the opposite direction

99
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,441
Sickle

100
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,400
It's good to be home

101
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:32,640
The most important thing is

102
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,080
It's better to be with my little Xianggong

103
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,761
Fish, because of my business

104
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,721
Almost killed you and King Jing

105
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm sorry

106
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,441
What for

107
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,721
You and I still say these three words

108
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,441
This apology is for myself

109
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
It's also for Gao Mo

110
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,400
What about Gao Mo? He is loyal and upright

111
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,721
He can abandon everything for you now

112
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,200
It's too late for me to be happy

113
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:08,161
Besides, if it weren't for him,

114
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,640
Qi Zhang and I would have died long ago

115
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,400
But

116
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,080
Yue, look at the two of us now

117
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
They're all alive, aren't they

118
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,480
This is the most important thing

119
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,561
Besides, I also hope you can let go of some worries

120
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,441
Start a new life

121
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,401
OK, I'll listen to you

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,480
During my absence,

123
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,521
Did a lot of things happen between you and Gao Mo

124
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,600
How do I feel

125
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,240
You are different from him

126
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,001
People have experienced so much

127
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,920
How can there be no change

128
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,881
At the beginning

129
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,600
I thought one person could carry everything

130
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,480
Can stumble

131
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
Fate still sent him to my side

132
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:00,881
Maybe

133
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,040
This is fate, right

134
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,720
High ink

135
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,240
What are you doing

136
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:20,761
I have come to plead guilty to my disrespectful treatment of your highness before

137
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,761
Zhou Yue asked you to come

138
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:28,081
A Yue said that if you do something wrong, you must be brave enough to admit it

139
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,961
She dares to bear the crime of deceiving the king

140
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:32,360
Why can't I

141
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,720
Why do you think killing the captaincy is a minor sin

142
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,600
Where are you now a captaincy

143
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,840
Clearly just like Yu Er

144
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,761
They are all the closest flesh and blood of the emperor

145
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm too lazy to talk to you

146
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,480
Your Highness, this is forgiving me

147
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
Who said Ben forgave you

148
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,521
You're guilty

149
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,881
The sin is not to resign

150
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,001
In the Ming Dynasty, the king told the emperor

151
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,360
To reinstate you

152
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,121
Be loyal to the big start for a lifetime

153
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,121
His Royal Highness

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,160
Let's go quickly

155
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,521
Your Highness

156
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,441
What else is there

157
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,641
The emperor intended to pass on to you

158
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,920
You

159
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,240
How do you feel

160
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,641
Qi Yu is your cousin

161
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,680
This matter concerns the future of your Gaos family

162
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:28,761
What do you think

163
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,401
As long as the man sitting in the dragon chair

164
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,121
Don't hurt Yu Er

165
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,561
It's enough not to hurt my aunt

166
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:39,881
I know

167
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,441
If it was you

168
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,480
Yu'er is safe

169
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,961
What about you and King Jing

170
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:00,160
I don't know

171
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,680
A fish has happened in the past

172
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,480
But we can't draw the ground as a prison

173
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,761
I can't extricate myself by encircling myself inside

174
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,521
The talent in front of you is your future

175
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,840
It's always easier to persuade people than to persuade yourself

176
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,881
What kind of end-result is it between me and him

177
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,600
Just like you said, look at fate

178
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,961
Besides, I don't have that much thought now

179
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,081
To worry about this

180
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,201
King Ning has already fallen to the law

181
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,280
But the Xiao Rong Wang case is not over yet

182
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:37,961
Yeah

183
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,360
It's not over yet

184
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,521
Ning Wang and He Guangning are dead

185
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:47,480
We have to think again

186
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,561
People who are dying are naturally not afraid of death

187
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,761
But Helanya's life has just begun

188
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,840
There is absolutely no way that she will give up any chance

189
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,840
Don't cut me

190
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:10,160
Don't cut me. I don't want to die

191
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,600
I don't want to die

192
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,800
Isn't it hard to wait for death

193
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:33,600
Also

194
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,521
Do all the bad things and be punished

195
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,920
You really should have prepared for this a long time ago

196
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,480
Gu Yi

197
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,561
Do you know

198
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,441
As early as when your family was exiled,

199
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,680
I told myself

200
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,881
I am Helanya

201
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,201
Never

202
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,360
To end up like that

203
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:09,160
I can never live as pitifully as you

204
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,641
But now

205
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:17,600
Miss Tangtangshijia has become a prisoner

206
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,920
If it is light, it will be exiled or executed

207
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
Even if he survives, he is a criminal

208
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,321
Be spurned all your life

209
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:30,040
Don't say it again. I don't want to hear it

210
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,240
You don't want to hear

211
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,280
I care for those who survived in my family

212
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,521
This is how I lingered for many years

213
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,001
So what exactly do you want

214
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,081
I want you to name He Guang and Ning Wang

215
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,081
How is it designed to frame Gu Jia

216
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:44,961
I want you to tell the truth

217
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,641
Good

218
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,160
I can say

219
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,641
But I want to say it in front of the emperor

220
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,280
I have a way to get him to spare me from death

221
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:08,081
The emperor won't even meet your father and King Ning

222
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,800
Meet you

223
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,720
What if I told him

224
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,840
The man who poisoned Xiao Rong Wang in those days

225
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
Not the King of the First Scene

226
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,081
You said

227
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,201
It was not Xian Jing Wang who poisoned and framed Xiao Rong Wang

228
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
And who is that

229
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:43,121
If the sinful woman says the emperor, can you spare my life

230
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:47,961
I can take your head off now

231
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:52,840
It's King Ning

232
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:56,401
Years ago

233
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:59,201
King Xian Jing really intended to poison

234
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
But at the crucial moment, his heart melted

235
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,641
Because King Ning has been afraid of the forces of Yongzhou

236
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,881
I took the opportunity to let my father

237
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,441
Poisoned the imperial concubine's soup

238
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,680
Frame the King of the First Scene

239
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,121
What you said

240
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,321
But really

241
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:22,521
Every sentence is true, never dare to have half a false sentence

242
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,121
That's what my father told me in prison

243
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,761
He wants me to borrow King Ning's secret

244
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,160
Save the lives of the whole family

245
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:35,401
The man who poisoned the emperor was not my father

246
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:40,641
Why can you care for your family and be wronged for no reason

247
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,160
If Lord Gu is not convicted,

248
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:47,840
My father will never get ahead

249
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,961
Helanya

250
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:53,160
Your congratulatory family is really wolf-hearted

251
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,240
Unworthy of being human

252
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,800
You not only set up loyal ministers

253
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,321
Even a weak child is spared

254
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:05,800
Over the years

255
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,401
Constantly poisoning him

256
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,521
You are too vicious

257
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,961
But it was all my father's work

258
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,641
I really don't know anything about it

259
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:16,081
Emperor

260
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
Can you see that for the sake of being coerced

261
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,561
Spare my life

262
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,081
What about Yihui

263
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
It's true that you killed Yi Hui.

264
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
I can't help it either

265
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:30,680
When at that time

266
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,321
She broke King Ning's secret

267
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,160
Even if I don't do it,

268
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
Ning Wang will not let her go

269
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,321
Helanya, you are so vicious

270
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:43,081
Somebody drag me out

271
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,240
I

272
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,240
Emperor

273
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,440
Your Majesty, I beg you to spare my life, Your Majesty

274
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:52,161
I can't spare you today because you have committed many evils

275
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,001
The emperor is on me

276
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:57,480
Lord Chow

277
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,320
I really didn't mean to kill Yi Hui

278
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,240
I-I'm just out of desperation

279
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,560
Would you please help me

280
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:06,681
Tall man

281
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:07,440
You just look at it

282
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
For the sake of Lanya's friendship with you,

283
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,921
Would you please plead for me

284
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,001
I

285
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:19,121
Your Royal Highness King Jing, at least I can be regarded as

286
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
For the sake of your father

287
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,641
You have cleared your name for Yongzhou

288
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,761
Gu Yi, you and my relatives

289
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:32,121
Do you really have the heart to see me beheaded

290
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
You plead for me

291
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,161
Your Majesty, now I have pleaded guilty to the law

292
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,480
The truth has also been told in full

293
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,801
She Chen has recovered from a serious illness except Xiao Rong Wang

294
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,720
Please spare my life, Your Majesty

295
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,560
Emperor

296
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,240
Let it be

297
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,360
I think you are still young

298
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:00,121
It's another threat of being bewitched

299
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,720
I'll spare you the death penalty

300
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:06,161
Someone put her in jail

301
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,281
Alternative distribution

302
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,761
The emperor spared me, the emperor

303
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,761
The emperor spared me

304
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:13,560
Go

305
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,281
Now the treacherous court official has been removed

306
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,080
Everything has settled

307
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,401
You protectors have made meritorious deeds

308
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:35,761
I will give you a good reward

309
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:40,641
Your Majesty, this matter is not over yet

310
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:41,921
What else is there

311
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:47,240
Please ask the emperor to reverse the verdict for the family

312
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,761
Shen fish

313
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,001
Emperor

314
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,360
Your Majesty, you're awake

315
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:23,600
Total victory

316
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,480
Where are they

317
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:29,881
The old slave let them all step down first

318
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,080
Xuan

319
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:39,401
An audience with Shen Yu

320
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:53,521
If you have anything you want to say, just say it

321
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:01,360
No matter what you say today,

322
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,080
I won't punish you

323
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:08,440
Well, then

324
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,001
Dare to ask the emperor if he knows the grievances of his family

325
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,240
Know

326
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,360
I once heard that when the emperor did not ascend to the throne,

327
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,080
Poisoned by other princes

328
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,761
It was my father who saved you in distress

329
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,720
But why do you repay good with bad

330
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,681
I took care of more than ten lives in my family

331
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,960
To die with injustice

332
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,521
I have my last resort

333
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,161
Have to

334
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,121
You have no choice but to say

335
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,401
Let there be more than ten ghosts in this world

336
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:01,801
Family women are displaced from place to place

337
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:06,600
Starve, freeze and suffer humiliation

338
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,840
How can you bear it in your heart

339
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,281
You broke into trouble for your own personal gain

340
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:17,641
Indulge the adulterer to kill the loyal minister

341
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,281
I especially want to ask you for so many years

342
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,320
Do you really have a clear conscience

343
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,161
Year

344
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:36,401
In addition to taking care of the family,

345
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,761
I did think about it

346
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:47,080
Gu Qing is not a conspirator with Yongzhou

347
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:51,121
Nor is it the rebel

348
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:55,480
I was wrong

349
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,960
I

350
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:01,121
I'm sorry, Gu Qing

351
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,480
I

352
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,521
I'm sorry you care for your family

353
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,560
I'm sorry

354
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:21,041
How heavy it is for you to say sorry

355
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,161
But Shen Yu said something to risk his death

356
00:24:28,921 --> 00:24:31,360
For more than ten unjust deaths,

357
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,681
Especially too light

358
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,881
This sentence of yours

359
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
I can't change these more than ten dead souls

360
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:44,521
I can't change the joy of my family

361
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,161
I can't change it back. I care for my family all my life.

362
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:56,240
Since you know that caring for your family is a grievance

363
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,521
Please also ask the emperor to reverse the case for the family

364
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:13,801
I

365
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,840
Can't be what you want

366
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,200
Children still know that mistakes can be corrected

367
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:25,840
You are a king

368
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:28,440
Is it so hard to admit the mistakes of that year

369
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,921
The name behind Regal

370
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,041
It's so important to you

371
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,401
Right and wrong merits and demerits have their own comments by future generations

372
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,720
I

373
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,960
Put these down a long time ago

374
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:50,440
Why on earth is that

375
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,041
Because

376
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,320
I

377
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,600
It is the monarch of Daqi

378
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,200
Involve the whole Daqiguo

379
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,320
I can make mistakes

380
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:10,200
You can also admit your mistakes

381
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,681
But

382
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,761
Dignity and national prestige of the great enlightenment country

383
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,360
Must not be shaken

384
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,921
Nowadays, the border is turbulent and the bureau is uneasy

385
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,360
My body

386
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,921
It has gone from bad to worse

387
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,801
If the verdict is reversed at this time,

388
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:38,320
Take over the new emperor again

389
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:40,720
That will inevitably lead to instability of the people's hearts

390
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,200
I enlighten the country

391
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:47,121
Will be in jeopardy

392
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,440
Then I care for more than ten ghosts in my family

393
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,761
What about the sufferings suffered over the years

394
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,600
Shen fish

395
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,080
The stability of the country requires human sacrifice

396
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,921
This also includes me

397
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,521
I hope you can understand

398
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,281
Your family's innocence

399
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,161
Now

400
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,240
It has been related to the stability of thousands of people

401
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,641
Although Emperor A Yu didn't tell the world,

402
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:33,001
However, Gu's family has been forgiven for the people

403
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:35,240
Returning the land and exempting the criminal slave status

404
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,761
You can live in the capital with dignity

405
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:39,960
To live anywhere in the world

406
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Don't go

407
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Yeah I heard

408
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:48,840
King Jing knelt all day

409
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,761
The emperor made an exception and allowed it

410
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,360
Ah Yue, you and my sisters have deep feelings in their hearts forever

411
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,320
You don't have to get along day and night

412
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:04,600
I'll come back to see you

413
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,560
A Yu insisted on leaving

414
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:18,521
Do you already know

415
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,080
King Jing is the emperor's own

416
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Qi Zhang is my own son

417
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:50,281
You don't want him to succeed

418
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,041
The world is in turmoil because you care for your family

419
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,200
I know you don't love power

420
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,281
But I'm opening up now

421
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:33,080
It is restless in the border

422
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:36,681
Inward is also an undercurrent

423
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm running out of time

424
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,600
Yu'er is still young

425
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,041
The country that can't afford this great enlightenment

426
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,720
Zhang son, I am not forcing you

427
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,960
Is to beg you

428
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:08,200
The emperor and his ministers once searched up and down for fear of virtue and respect

429
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,641
But now I understand

430
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,761
Want to be a generation of emperors

431
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
You must give up first

432
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,440
A part of oneself

433
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,720
Some people can do it, but I can't

434
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:23,560
I don't want to pay such a big price

435
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:27,320
But I can assure the emperor

436
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,161
Although Yu'er is small

437
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,720
But I will do my best to assist

438
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,041
I hope the emperor will forgive me

439
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,521
Since the emperor has made up his mind,

440
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,840
You don't have to force him, do you

441
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,641
May Mother be in good health

442
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,281
Kneel

443
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,921
Long live my emperor, long live my emperor

444
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,600
Jiangnan Zhoujia Silk Satin Shop

445
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,801
The total income this month is 8,200 taels

446
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:06,480
Jiangnan Zhoujia Silk and Satin Shop 3,600 Liang

447
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:09,360
Beijing Zhoujia Silk and Satin Shop totaled this month

448
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,960
There is something wrong with Jiangnan's accounts

449
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,401
There are two hundred taels missing

450
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,600
Miss Wu, pardon

451
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,641
It was I who mistakenly transported the transportation expenses

452
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,200
It's four hundred taels

453
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:22,560
A Yue

454
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:31,401
A Yue

455
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:32,121
Mother

456
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:32,840
Good boy

457
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,480
Grandma came to see you

458
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,161
Grandmother

459
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:38,480
A Yue

460
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:42,041
You propped up our whole Zhou family by yourself

461
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,200
You've worked hard

462
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:46,600
Grandma's family should be like this

463
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,521
Well said

464
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,121
We're a family

465
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:51,960
A family

466
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,281
We're a family

467
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:22,560
Lady

468
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,521
You've been drawing this for an hour

469
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:29,080
Does it take so long for women to dress up

470
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,041
Today, the Marquis asked us to enjoy the flowers together

471
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,521
Naturally, I have to dress up carefully

472
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,161
Xianggong, do I look good

473
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:44,360
I think so

474
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,001
It seems that chic is more suitable for you

475
00:35:58,721 --> 00:35:59,721
What are you talking about

476
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:02,760
Meimei is dead

477
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,280
You let go of me

478
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:15,360
Mother, look at the lanterns I made

479
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:19,320
Our lanterns made by Yi are the best

480
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,961
Is our family happy?

481
00:37:57,161 --> 00:38:00,121
Is that I will never leave you all my life

482
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,000
Never leave home for a lifetime

483
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,241
So good

484
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,320
I thought you said you would learn martial arts in the future

485
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,961
I have to let you protect me when my brother is old

486
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:54,401
Gu Yi

487
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,961
Little blind man

488
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,201
I think I can see it

489
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,040
I don't have to be Princess King

490
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:16,040
I just want to be with my little blind man

491
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,760
Go to Baishou and never separate

492
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:24,641
Qi Zhang

493
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:29,600
I want to live for myself from now on

494
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Do you remember when we first met

495
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,681
On the three chapters of the law

496
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:40,681
You've only done two things so far

497
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,080
Now

498
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:44,241
I want you to do the third one

499
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:45,401
What

500
00:42:48,481 --> 00:42:51,401
I want you to be the King's Princess Jing

501
00:42:58,961 --> 00:42:59,721
Sure
