1
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,439
High ink

2
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,840
A Yue

3
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,679
Are you all right

4
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,840
Upper

5
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:05,959
High ink

6
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
You protect Shen Yu and Zhou Yue

7
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,999
A fish

8
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,520
A fish

9
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,120
Be careful

10
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,399
I'm here

11
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,759
No one can hurt you

12
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,959
Fish be careful

13
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,319
A Yue

14
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,039
Don't even come over

15
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,560
High ink

16
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,560
Back off

17
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,759
Everybody back off

18
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,360
Or I'll kill him now

19
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
You can't leave if you kill him

20
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,319
It's a big deal to die together

21
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,080
This place is dangerous

22
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,399
You guys go and leave me alone

23
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,879
How can I leave you alone

24
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,039
I die without pity

25
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,920
But I can't bring trouble to you

26
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,879
A fish

27
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,319
Tell my mother

28
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,879
Failure to report

29
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,560
I am sorry for her

30
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:45,560
Say what you can't die

31
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,599
What's so good about being dead

32
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,159
You can eat red oil to explode your belly after you die

33
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,239
Can I eat sesame sauce baked wheat cake

34
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,200
How nice it is to be alive

35
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Why do you talk so much

36
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,319
What about killing people here

37
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,399
You can't respect me once

38
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,599
Give me this carriage

39
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:56,679
I'll let her go when I leave

40
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,280
Why should we trust you

41
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,479
How do you know if what you say is true

42
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,320
Don't you just want a hostage

43
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,799
You let her go. I'll come

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,359
Yes

45
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:05,280
No

46
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,639
You let her go

47
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,919
I'll be a hostage

48
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,239
This is my husband

49
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,320
Is it your turn

50
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,799
I had schoolmates with him before

51
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,320
Even with him

52
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,320
Have the meaning of the same robe

53
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,840
Not you guys

54
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,560
So much trouble

55
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,519
I'll do it

56
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
What's the matter with you

57
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,000
Sacrifice me

58
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,600
Are you all right

59
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,440
Are you all right

60
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,440
Nothing

61
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,440
Happy two pairs of people

62
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,359
Wait

63
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
This is important evidence

64
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,760
Can't throw

65
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,120
This dart

66
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,280
How do you look familiar

67
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,880
Saute belly with sesame sauce and baked wheat cake and red oil

68
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,519
Who bought it for me

69
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,440
I

70
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,919
You

71
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:54,479
Why did you buy me this

72
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,199
Didn't you say today

73
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,199
You can't eat it after you die

74
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,799
Have you fried your belly with sesame sauce and red oil

75
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,519
I guess it's your favorite

76
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,959
Who said that

77
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,320
I don't like these two things the most

78
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,519
The sesame paste is bored to death

79
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,000
The fried tripe tastes strange

80
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,560
Why do you say that today if you don't like it

81
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,479
I'm eager to save people. I'm in a hurry

82
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,560
Just pick out these two least favorite ones and say them

83
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,679
It seems that I think too much

84
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,600
Since I don't like it, I take it away.

85
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,040
What for

86
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,239
Be angry

87
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,959
Then you leave it here. I'll eat it.

88
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,120
Dislike

89
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,720
You don't have to force it

90
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,720
What's the matter? You're really mad at me

91
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,239
I speak a little straight

92
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,639
You leave it here. I'll eat it

93
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,760
Why should I want to eat if I don't like it

94
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,639
Don't throw up

95
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:43,600
Sweet

96
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:44,440
It's sugar

97
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,679
Don't be mad at me if you eat my sugar

98
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,639
Who the hell are you

99
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,199
The man who saved me in those days was obviously a stubborn boy

100
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,679
Why is it so similar to A Yu

101
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,519
How

102
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,479
There is no change around the villa

103
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,440
Temporary security

104
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,199
But

105
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,120
Who is lying in wait for us today

106
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,600
Ning Wang is in a hurry again

107
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,440
It won't just offend Long Yan

108
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,479
Just act again

109
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,359
Ning Wang will not take risks

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,600
Don't forget

111
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,959
He also has an ignorant son Qi Mao

112
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,560
He can't keep his cool

113
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,040
Here comes the tall man

114
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,840
His Royal Highness King Jing

115
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
It's still convenient now

116
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,239
Gao has some doubts in his heart

117
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,399
I hope your highness will give me some advice

118
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:46,560
Convenient

119
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,040
Originally, King Jing wanted to find opportunities

120
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,199
Ask you a thing or two

121
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,919
I delivered it to my door

122
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,479
Occipital cloud

123
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:54,679
You go down

124
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:57,919
Tall people, please sit down

125
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,840
Farewell to the last flower viewing party

126
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,239
I haven't seen Gao Guifei for a long time

127
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,600
I don't know the imperial concubine

128
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,000
How are you now

129
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,079
Don't mention it

130
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,040
Ever since that incident

131
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,400
My aunt's body has been suffering from illness

132
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,479
He Yuan's envoy prescribed so many precious medicinal materials

133
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:19,400
Tonic

134
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:20,760
It doesn't help

135
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,279
That

136
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,120
Can too hospital say where is the disease of imperial concubine

137
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't know either

138
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,799
Congratulatory envoy

139
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I never gave a definite answer

140
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,719
We are not allowed to

141
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,159
Find another famous doctor

142
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,159
Why not allow

143
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,560
The emperor, of course

144
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,359
It is estimated that I am afraid that the doctors outside are not good at medical skills

145
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,960
Cure your aunt's health

146
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,679
Wrong, Your Highness

147
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,560
It was I who asked you to ask about something

148
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,640
Why are you asking me instead

149
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,159
This is not the last time

150
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,960
The imperial concubine fell into the water in Jingwangfu

151
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,520
Has this king always been guilty in his heart

152
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,839
Two more questions

153
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,640
Come

154
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:01,960
What's wrong with tall people

155
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:02,960
But it doesn't hurt to say

156
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,279
I'm afraid your highness

157
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,880
You may not know everything

158
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,880
High ink

159
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,320
Do you know who you're talking to

160
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,039
You're here

161
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,799
I came to see how you were doing

162
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,440
I thought you didn't like these

163
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,679
I liked eating very much when I was a child

164
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Once fled the famine

165
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,320
Hungry for a long time

166
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
I fled to a family

167
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,440
A home selling sesame sauce baked wheat cake and fried tripe with red oil

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
At that time, ah

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,640
I just think this is delicious in the world

170
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,520
I don't know how much I ate

171
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,520
Anyway, I threw up for three days in the end

172
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,440
I haven't eaten it since then

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,359
You did suffer a lot

174
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,080
Nothing that can be said is bitter

175
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,799
True bitterness

176
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,719
Is hidden in my heart

177
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,520
You can't tell outsiders, can you

178
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,560
Isn't that right, Xianggong

179
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,640
Should I call you Xianggong

180
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,960
Or should I call you sister

181
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,400
A fish

182
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,799
Actually, I

183
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,679
What are you actually

184
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,640
I

185
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,560
I don't know how to say it

186
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:44,880
Don't mention it

187
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,919
Then don't say it

188
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,960
Listen to me. Do you think I'm right

189
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
The property of Zhou's big room to three rooms

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,080
Always eyeing

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,919
If you are a woman

192
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,279
You can't escape the fate of marriage

193
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Then your family business

194
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,239
It became the old lady's bag

195
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:04,200
So you dress up as a man

196
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,039
Guard one's possessions

197
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,799
Marry me in the name of Chong Xi

198
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,239
Hide one's eyes and ears

199
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,479
MISS ZHOU

200
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
You kept secrets from everyone for so many years

201
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,120
When it's really not easy

202
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,159
So

203
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,799
Are you going to expose me

204
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,719
Or do you want money

205
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,919
Money

206
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,960
Zhou Yue

207
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,279
I thought

208
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,400
Even if we are not couples in the same bed,

209
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
It can also be regarded as a confidant who treats each other with sincerity

210
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,479
I didn't expect

211
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,039
How do you look at me

212
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,120
It's not that I don't trust you

213
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,719
It's my responsibility that is too heavy

214
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,320
If I trust others easily,

215
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,239
Is to hang the fate of the three rooms above the tip of the knife

216
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,719
I can't afford to take any risks

217
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,239
Why am I a risk

218
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,200
When I pushed the imperial concubine into the water,

219
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,799
You don't ask why, either

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,880
And comforted me by saying

221
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,440
Everyone has secrets

222
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,400
Deficiency and humanity

223
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,520
Now the position has changed

224
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,039
Why do you think I would betray you

225
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,919
Am I so miserable in your heart

226
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,560
A fish

227
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Zhou Yue, I'm telling you

228
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:17,839
Your secret

229
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,239
I have it

230
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,159
It's not something to blackmail

231
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,159
It's something I want to guard

232
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,520
A fish

233
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,479
In this case

234
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,120
You can also confess your identity

235
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,520
What are the difficulties

236
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,880
Let's face it together

237
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,200
You dress up as a man

238
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,279
Sin never dies

239
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,599
But my identity has a lot to do with it

240
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,960
I'll bear the joys and sorrows of life and death alone

241
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,919
Don't want to bring trouble to others

242
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,640
I thought you said

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,760
Are we friends who treat each other with sincerity

244
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,799
A scholar dies for a bosom friend

245
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,599
It is not regrettable

246
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,440
Good

247
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,599
I'm telling you

248
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,479
I am the former hospital envoy of Taiyuan Hospital

249
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,880
Take care of the surviving daughter

250
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,120
Gu Yi

251
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,359
Imperial court Qin criminals who are fake and exchanged

252
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,479
Want to come so much

253
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,520
A lot of things

254
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,560
It's all reasonable

255
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,880
You're scared

256
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,359
Afraid

257
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm not afraid

258
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,919
What do you mean

259
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,719
What I'm afraid of is

260
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,599
You take risks by yourself

261
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,159
What I'm not afraid of is

262
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,880
You're not alone anymore

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,719
Henceforth

264
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,919
Be a blessing

265
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:58,479
You and I share

266
00:15:59,159 --> 00:15:59,719
Is a curse

267
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:01,640
Share it with two people

268
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,200
Xianggong

269
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,279
Wrong

270
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,279
Sister

271
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:11,880
Nor is it

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,440
What will I call you after this

273
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,440
Simply

274
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,159
Let's become sworn

275
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,320
Become sworn

276
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,719
Your Highness knows

277
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,599
The dead Chua

278
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,479
It's a parent's daughter

279
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,359
Gu Yi's lactating mother

280
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,960
Why do tall people say this

281
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,919
Since Shen Yu went to prison

282
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,039
Your Highness has made every effort

283
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,599
Calculate in place step by step

284
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,479
Even people buried in mass graves

285
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,960
Can come back to life

286
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,279
With the power of His Royal Highness

287
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,279
How can you not check Chua's true identity

288
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,120
King Ben

289
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,279
Be sure to know

290
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,400
Then dare you ask your highness

291
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,919
You are going to Jizhou to investigate the case

292
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,159
Do you really want to clear up your grievances for Shen Yu

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
Or is there another purpose

294
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,520
What is your selfishness

295
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,520
It's about the crown prince

296
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Or is it related to the Xiaorongwang case of that year

297
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:14,120
I can guess this layer of Xiaorong Wang's case

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He is a member of the Gaos family

299
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,320
Be in the punishments department

300
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,000
I have always had doubts about the Rong Wang case

301
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,400
If we can join hands with him,

302
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,279
Maybe it's not a bad thing

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,039
The tall man went on

304
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,799
Your Highness

305
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,359
Gao also has a sentence

306
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,719
It must be said in the front

307
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
If you want to investigate the Xiao Rong Wang case,

308
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,080
You don't have to

309
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,479
The Gaos have their own responsibilities

310
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,120
If your highness wants to use other means to compete for storage

311
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,679
Contrary to the way of being a minister

312
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,479
I am Gao Mo as assistant minister of punishments

313
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,799
Be sure to do your best

314
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,200
Share your worries for the emperor

315
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,320
Tall man

316
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,200
The crown prince is not contrary to the investigation

317
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,760
And this king is also a courtier of the emperor

318
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,599
Finding out the Xiaorong Wang case is also to share worries for the emperor

319
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,839
Don't tall people want to go before the crown prince decides

320
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,000
Find out the case

321
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:05,000
Leave the Gao family a chance to live

322
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,440
After the new emperor ascended the throne,

323
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,000
Xiao Rong Wang who still has a breath

324
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,239
Will become a thorn in his side

325
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,560
Gao family

326
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,719
Will also bear the brunt

327
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,479
There is no way to live

328
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,799
Man-made things

329
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,000
Tall man

330
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,000
In finding out the case of Xiaorong Wang,

331
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,080
You and I have the same goal

332
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,679
As for what will happen after uncovering the truth

333
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,239
That's all in the future

334
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,839
If we can find out the case of Xiaorongwang,

335
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,960
Gao Moding should go through fire and water

336
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,359
Never back down

337
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,000
Good

338
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,359
I only know that I am the same year as you

339
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,839
But I don't know when you were born

340
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,000
I was born on the fifth day of May

341
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,120
I think it's your sister

342
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,359
I was born on the fourth day of May

343
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,640
I won't lie to you again

344
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,839
Let it be

345
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,000
Sister's sister's is not interesting either

346
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,439
Let's call it by name in the future

347
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,599
Then will we worship or not

348
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,239
Bye

349
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,479
Today I

350
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,000
Gu Yi

351
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:29,079
Sister with Zhou Yue

352
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,599
Today, Zhou Yue and Gu Yi are sisters

353
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,000
Work together in this life

354
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,079
Support each other and never give up on life and death

355
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,040
Really learn from this statement

356
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,800
If you break your trust, heaven and man will kill together

357
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,400
Unexpectedly

358
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,239
I was originally Chongxi married a Xianggong

359
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,479
As a result, many sisters were surprised

360
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,120
I also thought that in my life

361
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,199
Have to talk to your nominal wife

362
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,719
Keep this secret to death

363
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,359
Unexpectedly

364
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,680
We can not only share the blessings and misfortunes

365
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,760
And became a relative

366
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
Thank God. Thank God

367
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let me have one more beauty

368
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,800
Sisters with money

369
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,640
Come on sister

370
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,640
Let me give you a hug

371
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,000
Tell the truth

372
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,319
Men's wear for a long time

373
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,079
I'm really a little unaccustomed to touching people

374
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:31,839
No harm

375
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,880
Xianggong

376
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,120
Just let me melt yours, madam

377
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,079
A heart that has been frozen for a long time

378
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Come and have a drink, Your Highness

379
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,280
You say our lives

380
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
Why is it so bitter

381
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:08,040
Be chased by people during the day

382
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,079
I have to see them at night

383
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:13,079
I'm very much in love and lingering

384
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,160
My heart

385
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,400
This king is puzzled by one thing

386
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:22,839
You are interested in Zhou Yue

387
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,800
How does it feel

388
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,000
Friends

389
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,520
I just think

390
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,040
Stay with him

391
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,160
Be at ease

392
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,559
Even if nothing special happens

393
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,319
Very happy, too

394
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
You know how I feel

395
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:43,839
How can Ben Wang understand

396
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,400
Don't pretend

397
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,880
It's not the first day I've met you

398
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,599
Look at Shen Yu. It's more than happy

399
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,040
You can't wait

400
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,640
Put her in your eyes

401
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,880
Don't talk nonsense

402
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,120
Ben Wang didn't have it

403
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,559
That is, Ayue is honest

404
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,800
If I were you

405
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,520
I've been desperate with you for a long time

406
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,319
Why is this

407
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,760
Also

408
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,680
Anyway, in the end

409
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,599
It is also the love of others

410
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,160
We can only drown our sorrows in wine

411
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,800
Have another drink

412
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,719
Come

413
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,760
I just want to drink

414
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,120
You keep such a big secret

415
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,479
Does King Jing know

416
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,599
It should be known

417
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,359
It's just that I never admitted

418
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,319
I don't want to implicate anyone about my family

419
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,559
Gao Mo has always had doubts about the Rong Wang case

420
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,120
I also found out that Cai's mother is a family servant

421
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,120
Not as good as

422
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,880
Why don't you join hands in investigating the case

423
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,400
Gao Mo knows the identity of Cai's mother

424
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,640
Xianggong

425
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,239
Gao Mo must hate Gu's family

426
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,559
You mustn't tell him who I am

427
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm afraid he'll stab me in the back

428
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,199
It won't

429
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,120
Gao Mo is a serious person

430
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,280
Clear grievances

431
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,199
How could you do such a thing

432
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:23,880
Besides

433
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,040
He is interested in handling cases

434
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,479
I also have my own way

435
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,719
He can enter the punishments department

436
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,959
It proves that there is something extraordinary about him

437
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,800
Yes yes yes

438
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,280
Gao Mo must have many advantages

439
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
But when it comes to investigating cases, right

440
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,719
I really can't compliment Gao Qingtian's level

441
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,599
Begging him

442
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,280
I might as well ask Qi Zhang

443
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,680
Where is King Jing better again

444
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,280
What's wrong with him

445
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,000
As cold as ice

446
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,800
Deep in mind

447
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,479
Inhuman

448
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:51,959
Abdominal black poisonous tongue

449
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,599
Arrogant complacency

450
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,439
Be defiant

451
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,000
Wait a minute

452
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,959
He's your cousin at least

453
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,479
How can you say that about him behind his back

454
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,880
Am I not right

455
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,120
Of course it's wrong

456
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,680
He is clearly

457
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,640
Strategize

458
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,239
Decision-making is thousands of miles away

459
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,640
Talking and laughing

460
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,680
Ashes and smoke

461
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,120
The enemy is still in stride at present

462
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,479
The most important thing is that people are born well

463
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,439
Say it looks better than Pan an

464
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,000
Yan Ruguan's jade is not too much

465
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,719
Are you still talking about King Jing who I know

466
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:29,280
You're not talking about the Gao Mo I know

467
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,880
Landing as a brother

468
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,719
Why bother with flesh and blood

469
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,160
Be happy as fun

470
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,599
Wine fighting

471
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,479
Polyproximity

472
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,239
Gao Mo, your capacity for drinking is too bad, isn't it

473
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,280
What are you doing

474
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,400
Get up quickly

475
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,920
A Yue

476
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,599
A Yue

477
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,680
Also spoiled

478
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,280
Be unashamed

479
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:26,359
A Yue

480
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,280
You drank too

481
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,680
What are you doing up there

482
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,880
Cool

483
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,000
A fish

484
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,760
I'll send Gao Mo back to my room first

485
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,839
King Jingjing should also be drunk

486
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:35,839
Roof danger

487
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,199
You should persuade him to come down quickly

488
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,239
You go quickly

489
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:38,800
Let's go

490
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,280
A Yue

491
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,719
My heart is bitter

492
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,959
I know I know

493
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,599
I suffer

494
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,079
Climb so high after drinking

495
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,120
After a while, I couldn't stand still and fell down

496
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,199
Come down

497
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:51,959
Don't

498
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,760
Don't what don't

499
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,359
I tell you I don't have the patience of Zhou Yue

500
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:58,439
Don't blame me for falling down later. Don't care about you

501
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,400
Get down here quickly

502
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:02,520
No matter, no matter

503
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,439
Compete with me, right

504
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,640
I'll ask you again if you can't get off

505
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,520
If you love it, you can't go to your own devices.

506
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,760
If it weren't for your saving me,

507
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,319
I don't care about you

508
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,040
Why is the roof so high

509
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,079
There you are

510
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,520
Not bashful to say

511
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,040
I'm telling you

512
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,359
Expense for physical exertion

513
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,880
Mental loss fee

514
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,319
Time loss fee

515
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,800
You have to fold it into silver and give it to me

516
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,880
Come down with me

517
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,839
What are you doing

518
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,800
What are you doing

519
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,880
What are you doing

520
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:58,880
I'm not going down

521
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,959
Don't give me that look

522
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,680
I won't eat your pear flower with rain

523
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,000
You gotta come down with me

524
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,839
Don't go down

525
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,640
What the hell do you want

526
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,000
Listen to me

527
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,079
Go ahead

528
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,959
I have a friend

529
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,199
What are you laughing at

530
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,040
Nothing

531
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,959
It's your beginning. It's too classic

532
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,880
You're a friend

533
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,359
I know him, don't I

534
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:44,839
Recognize

535
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,800
Is this friend of yours

536
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,439
Have a particularly bad temper

537
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,120
And then I often put on a smelly face

538
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,319
Yes

539
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,000
It's not

540
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:55,959
Row

541
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,160
I see

542
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,400
You go ahead

543
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,920
This little hip flask

544
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,479
And this little wine glass

545
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,839
It's a couple

546
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,760
This little wine glass

547
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,199
That's me

548
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,680
Friend

549
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,199
Your friend

550
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:19,760
What about this hip flask

551
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,800
Covet wine

552
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,520
So I find all kinds of reasons to earn wine

553
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,959
So I followed my wine glass friend

554
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,239
It also made a pair

555
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,880
This little hip flask

556
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,439
It's me

557
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,079
Wine

558
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,160
It's silver

559
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,800
Can you listen to me

560
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,319
You keep talking

561
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,400
At first

562
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,120
My friend

563
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,800
Think the small hip flask is vulgar

564
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,640
My friend is supreme and precious

565
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,680
I didn't like her at first

566
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,719
Who likes you

567
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,559
I'm sorry. You keep talking

568
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,079
He slowly discovered that

569
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,520
The small hip flask is very brave

570
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Although coveting wine,

571
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,040
But she is affectionate and righteous

572
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:07,959
Very hot

573
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,319
You have a good eye

574
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,239
So gradually and gradually

575
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,079
He cares about the hip flask

576
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,239
But he felt at the time

577
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,160
He cares about the flask because

578
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,559
Small hip flask helps itself with things

579
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,760
Later

580
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,439
He found himself

581
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:27,479
Not only care about the safety of small hip flask

582
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,000
Care more about her

583
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,439
Have not eaten enough

584
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,199
Wear warm or not

585
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,920
Care about her joys and sorrows

586
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,280
But he never told the flask

587
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,839
His care

588
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,199
Because he knows

589
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,760
My wine glass friend

590
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,680
It

591
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,920
Is redundant

592
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,959
Qi Zhang

593
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,680
What is the Lord of the Northwest

594
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,359
Heaven-upholstery nobles

595
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,359
I don't really have anything

596
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,520
It's also quite good

597
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,400
At least you have the right to be involved

598
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,239
Don't worry about food and clothing

599
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,559
Power

600
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,640
Power is just to let people around you

601
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,520
It's just something to be afraid of

602
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,719
It was fine when I was a child

603
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,400
Both parents are here

604
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,920
I can do whatever I want

605
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:38,760
But then

606
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,359
Mother missing

607
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Father is dead, too

608
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,520
This power

609
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,640
It became the responsibility I had to take

610
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,680
Become a cage for me

611
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:18,959
What are you doing

612
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,920
Let's go down first

613
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,040
Go on and talk about it

614
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,800
Let go of me

615
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:24,319
Don't make a fuss

616
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,040
You let go of me

617
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,559
Let go of me

618
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,000
Are you all right

619
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,199
Did you drink too much or not

620
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm so dizzy

621
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,040
Qi Zhang

622
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,120
I can't carry you

623
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,439
You're normal

624
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,280
Say what care

625
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,439
Just want me to take you home

626
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,599
I really owe you in my last life

627
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,359
Little Lady

628
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,239
This is your new game with your highness

629
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,599
You cut the crap. Come on

630
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,400
Come and do me a favor

631
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:40,719
Come

632
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,479
You can't go

633
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,359
What to do

634
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,800
Your Highness needs someone to take care of him

635
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,040
I'm going out

636
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,640
Wait a minute

637
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,280
Aren't you going to wash your hands

638
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,199
Go out to wash

639
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,120
You

640
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,400
It's so cold

641
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,280
It's so hot

642
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,920
It's cute when you're drunk

643
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,800
He found himself

644
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:32,359
Not only care about the safety of small hip flask

645
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,719
Care more about it

646
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,920
Eat or not eat, wear or not wear warm clothes

647
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,880
Care about its joys and sorrows

648
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:42,120
My wine glass friend

649
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,319
It is redundant

650
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,280
I thought we all said it was hot

651
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:51,040
This big rooster tossed me for most of the night

652
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,640
The bones are falling apart

653
00:35:58,759 --> 00:35:59,799
What is it

654
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,240
It must have been the assassin who changed the way he assassinated

655
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:09,880
What kind of rat generation

656
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,559
Hide one's head and expose one's tail

657
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,759
Show up quickly

658
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,680
Have to go in advance

659
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
This pigeon can pass books thousands of miles away

660
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,599
Remember to keep it well

661
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,039
What is this

662
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:33,720
Octopus

663
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,839
Qi Zhang

664
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,120
I thought we agreed to go to Cai's mother's house together

665
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,759
How to go first

666
00:36:41,880 --> 00:37:43,120
Where's Ah Yu Gao Mo

667
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,160
What is this

668
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,279
A Yue

669
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,680
I found a clue

670
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,319
What is this

671
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,160
You two classmates

672
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,120
It's really like it

673
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,799
Isn't it good to leave without saying goodbye

674
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:09,640
At least tell the little lady

675
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,920
I left a note

676
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,640
Really ruthless

677
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,999
Trouble little lady all night

678
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Leave today when you say so

679
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:20,960
If I were a woman,

680
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,960
I will be sad, too

681
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,480
If I stay

682
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:26,279
She's not sad, she's hurt

683
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,799
I mean the assassins

684
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:32,999
It's obviously for me

685
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,120
If I stay

686
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,200
It will only add danger to them

687
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,200
That's true, too

688
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,039
And these assassins

689
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,599
Can intercept on the only way to Cai's hometown

690
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,599
It is possible to continue to ambush in front

691
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,319
Wait a minute

692
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,319
Are you asking me to be the vanguard with you

693
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,359
Then I won't go

694
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:05,680
Tall man

695
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,640
What you call a new clue

696
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,400
Is to go to the local yamen to investigate

697
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,559
Aren't these assassins registered locally

698
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:14,400
Yeah

699
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:15,480
In this way

700
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,120
The scope of investigation has been narrowed down

701
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,920
The whole territory is so big

702
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,079
He is expanding the scope

703
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,120
Or narrow it down

704
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,240
What are you talking about

705
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,480
Nothing

706
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,160
I mean, ah

707
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
My husband is really right

708
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,759
This tall man really has his own way of handling cases

709
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,079
Is it

710
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:36,920
You complimented me

711
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,640
How to boast

712
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:38,319
Let's hear it

713
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,839
Let's talk about the case first

714
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,720
The killer who is running away now

715
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,519
Be missing

716
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,279
The clue is equal to interruption

717
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,759
Where should we start

718
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,440
If only there were portraits

719
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,240
A Yue

720
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,200
Don't even come over

721
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,079
Back off

722
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,640
I remember

723
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,599
The killer who held me hostage

724
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,720
On the neck

725
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,519
There is a meniscus mark

726
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,039
A meniscus mark

727
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,079
What exactly does it look like

728
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,240
There it goes

729
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:28,640
A fish

730
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:30,079
Do you think of anything

731
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:36,160
No

732
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:37,519
I just think

733
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,599
This shape is quite strange

734
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,079
A meniscus mark

735
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,160
My dad had a long companion before

736
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,799
There is such a mark on the neck

737
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,559
I remember the superstitious woman in the house

738
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,279
I also said that this must be a previous life

739
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:57,680
Left by unjust death

740
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,160
Could it be him

741
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,519
Why did he talk to Cai's mother

742
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,880
Appear one after another

743
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,359
If only the big rooster were here

744
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:11,039
He's so clever

745
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,240
Can you analyze it for me

746
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,839
This has only been with Shen Yu for a few days

747
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:33,999
This won't kiss me

748
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,200
White-eyed wolf

749
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,400
Clearly ask me for something

750
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,120
And say it so confidently

751
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:12,519
Dried fish

752
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,599
A Yue

753
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,200
A Yue

754
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:39,279
A fish

755
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,200
Why are you here so late

756
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,519
If you have anything to say, go in and talk about it

757
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,079
A Yue

758
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,839
You think about it again

759
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,640
The killer who hijacked you that day

760
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,480
Do you have any other characteristics on your body

761
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,880
He was dressed in black

762
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,400
Covered again

763
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,759
I really can't remember anything.

764
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,400
But

765
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,920
On him

766
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,799
There is a strange taste

767
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,920
A peculiar taste

768
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,680
What does it smell like

769
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:14,759
Like herbs

770
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,039
With a faint fragrance

771
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,480
Herbal medicine

772
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,999
With a faint fragrance

773
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,599
That's the smell

774
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,279
What is this

775
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:56,960
I'll take you to the fair

776
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,359
Look at that

777
00:42:58,799 --> 00:42:59,920
Wear a hat like this

778
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,440
You cover your eyes again

779
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,160
Others can't see anything anymore

780
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:04,160
I'm not going

781
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:05,599
Don't

782
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,599
Look at such a beautiful boy as me

783
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,079
How dangerous it is to go out by yourself

784
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,599
You're coming with me

785
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:11,640
Although a little blind

786
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,160
At least you can help shout for help

787
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,200
Why are you angry again

788
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,160
Is your temper so capricious

789
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:24,519
What is this

790
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:25,160
Don't throw up

791
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,079
It's sugar

792
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:26,999
Sweet

793
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:31,240
You ate my candy

794
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,440
You have to accompany me to the market

795
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:38,680
Take my hand

796
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,640
Let's not get separated

797
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,120
After a while, I arrived at the market

798
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,519
There is a snack shop that tastes very good

799
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,120
Let's eat there

800
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:04,799
Little blind man

801
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,279
What's wrong with you

802
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,759
If my eyes can't see anymore

803
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,359
What should I do then

804
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,759
You still have me

805
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,960
I'll take you wherever you're going

806
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:18,960
You can't stay with me for the rest of my life

807
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:20,759
You won't be blind forever

808
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,599
What if

809
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,720
In case

810
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,759
I didn't think about it in case

811
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
But I thought about it

812
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,759
If I never see it again in my life,

813
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,359
I'd rather die

814
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,160
What are you dying for?

815
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,999
You can eat sesame sauce baked wheat cake when you die

816
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:38,160
Fried tripe with red oil

817
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:39,559
How nice it is to be alive

818
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,720
You can always say this

819
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:43,759
Strange words come

820
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:44,799
Is it strange

821
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,680
People always have to look forward to it when they are alive

822
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,400
Besides, my master is so powerful

823
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,920
She is sure to cure you

824
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,240
Really

825
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,039
Of course

826
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,039
Go quickly

827
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,999
Baked wheat cake with sesame sauce and fried belly with red oil

828
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:56,799
Still waiting for us

829
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,279
Make sure you're finished

830
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
I don't want to die anymore
