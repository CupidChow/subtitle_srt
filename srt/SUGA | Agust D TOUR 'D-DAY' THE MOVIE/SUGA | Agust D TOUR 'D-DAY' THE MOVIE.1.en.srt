1
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:05,338
I'm pretty calm before going on stage

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:09,467
I think to myself that
I have to kill it before I go on stage

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,845
I don't go up there expecting to lose

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,638
I'm seriously invincible

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,339
Singers look the coolest
when they do concerts

6
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,427
I've always been talking about
doing a concert

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,803
That's how it should be

8
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,972
When a new album comes out

9
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,851
the promotions start with a concert tour

10
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,314
That's why singers
and concerts are inseparable

11
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,609
There are many great singers

12
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,778
and many great dancers

13
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,863
I think a good performer

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,990
is someone who can pull off
all of these things

15
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,828
It's been my dream to become a singer

16
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,081
who can perform well
ever since I was young

17
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,549
It's the part that kind of shows

18
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,468
who Agust D is
as you officially set out

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,554
You have to show
your two opposing sides

20
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,640
That's the concept

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,644
There's gonna be a total of 27 to 28 songs

22
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,645
Wow...

23
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,563
Then how long is the total running time?

24
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,607
Two hours

25
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,901
It's really packed

26
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,444
It is

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,738
But why are we starting with "D-Day"?

28
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,906
Because it's the D-DAY TOUR?

29
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,825
That too

30
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,286
I was gonna start off with
"Daechwita" or "Haegeum"

31
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,122
-and do something with that
-Yeah

32
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,293
but the performance itself is kind of...
How should I put this...

33
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,838
Uh... There's only so much you can do

34
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,173
Since visually, they're such intense songs

35
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,302
But don't you think we should
start off with "Daechwita"?

36
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,846
That's what I think

37
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,640
Don't you think it'll be a bit much?

38
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,269
In my opinion, it's so...

39
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,062
It'd be too "Daechwita"

40
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,149
Oh... Really?

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,111
I think that's the best intro

42
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,573
When we start the show
I think "D-Day" is kind of more...

43
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,993
It feels more like an opening

44
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,704
I think it'll be better to do "Daechwita"

45
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,165
after you bring up the energy a little bit

46
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,583
I get what you're saying

47
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,878
If I start with "Daechwita"

48
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,672
I do think we'll get stuck in that

49
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,923
if we go with "Daechwita" or "Haegeum"

50
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,758
We'll just practice it

51
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,178
and change the order later
if we want to

52
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,562
Lie down

53
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,736
Isn't this totally legendary?
It's so legendary

54
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,573
In all my life, I've never seen
a move like this

55
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,742
In all my life, I've never done
a move like this either

56
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,953
Why do you keep doing stuff
you've never done before?

57
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,581
-For an awesome show
-Right

58
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,749
-Start by lying down
-Okay

59
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,656
Honestly, I think this is tougher
than doing a BTS concert

60
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,283
That's how I honestly feel

61
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,787
I like concerts that are intense
all the way

62
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,125
and all my songs...

63
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,587
all the songs I perform in the beginning
are all title track-worthy songs

64
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,465
So when we were coming up with the setlist
I thought a lot about whether to do

65
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,009
"Daechwita" first or "Haegeum" first

66
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,887
but when the director first told me about

67
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,056
the idea of me being carried in
as the haegeum plays

68
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,558
I thought it'd be really cool

69
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,311
It kind of feels like a funeral procession

70
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,731
It's really scary
when you first see it

71
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,443
I think it'll be a sensational production

72
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,064
[Haegeum]

73
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,980
[Daechwita]

74
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,173
Are you ready to jump?

75
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,095
Everyone, jump!

76
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,024
Let's go!

77
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,001
Everyone, jump!

78
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,303
Say what

79
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,962
Everyone, jump!

80
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,305
Say what

81
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,539
[Agust D]

82
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,859
Today is the last day

83
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,737
Let's go!

84
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,074
It's the final day of the D-DAY TOUR
THE FINAL

85
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,912
It's the third concert
Today is really the last day

86
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,750
Everyone, are you ready to have fun?

87
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,503
Are you really ready?

88
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,340
Let's go!

89
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,862
[Give It to Me]

90
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,046
It's great to see you, ARMY

91
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,634
I'm SUGA

92
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,138
Agust D

93
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,559
and Min YunKi
It's great to see you

94
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:59,276
The encore concert of
D-DAY TOUR THE FINAL

95
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,111
It's really the final

96
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,158
It's really the last final for real

97
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,163
The day of the last concert has begun

98
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,669
It's already my third and last concert

99
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,340
I can still hear the cheers
when I announced

100
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,843
that there'd be an encore concert

101
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,140
ARMY, how is it?
Are you having fun?

102
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,061
On the left, are you having fun?

103
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,772
In the front

104
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,940
On the right

105
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,068
Second floor

106
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,449
Then make some noise!

107
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,079
Also, everyone watching
the live stream online

108
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,872
ARMY, are you enjoying it?

109
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,794
Okay, "It's because you're here"

110
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,836
You thought that was what I'd say, right?

111
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,506
I'm sure you're all having a great time

112
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,259
Since today is the final
of the final of the final

113
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,844
we'll all do our best

114
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:12,474
so that you and I have no regrets

115
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,018
when the concert is over today

116
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,770
I hope you all enjoy this moment

117
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,940
Today is really the last day

118
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,695
Put your phones down
and watch the show with your eyes

119
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,910
Should we get started then?

120
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,509
Today's cheers seem louder than usual

121
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,471
Let's go

122
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,682
Capo

123
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,726
Oh, capo

124
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,811
Where's my capo and pick?

125
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,812
I must've forgotten to bring it

126
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,824
Are you getting ready to go on tour?

127
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,409
We'll be out of the country for a month

128
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
We were talking about that earlier

129
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,871
How are we going to do our laundry?

130
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,539
You have to wash everything by hand

131
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,147
There's a set here?

132
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,528
This is where a lot of artists rehearse

133
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,403
Oh, really?

134
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,573
I wish I could just start
doing the concerts

135
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,575
Seriously

136
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,494
I was already done prepping in Korea

137
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,372
I'm all ready
I just need to go ahead and do it

138
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,556
This is more comfortable for you, right?
It's supposed to be on top

139
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,350
Can I just keep it here
and tune it?

140
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,809
Yes

141
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,436
But then, the note is different

142
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,230
Just keep the line in the middle

143
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,066
-What's this?
-Wow

144
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,610
-You got a lot of support
-Yeah

145
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,238
Support from the members

146
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,910
So, you're telling me to
put this on from the back

147
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,453
Yes, you can put it on from the back

148
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,929
The balance...
The guitar is so big

149
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,557
Also, I can't really hear the doubling

150
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,310
I can't quite catch the time
I can take a break

151
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,771
It's really hard right now, the sound

152
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,857
The balance is totally off now

153
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,610
I don't know what's mine

154
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,197
I feel like I'm playing too loudly

155
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,573
or too softly

156
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,158
I can't really tell

157
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,703
-I'll try to do everything I can
-Okay

158
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,647
Getting the sound right is hard

159
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,734
I've never experienced this kind of sound
that was all over the place

160
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,654
Maybe it's because it's been a while
since I've performed in an arena

161
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,992
I know the environment can't be
the same as a studio

162
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,411
but it's so different

163
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,461
I have no idea how much damping
to use for a live performance

164
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,841
My voice is hoarse
and I'm getting a lot of phlegm

165
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,843
I'm having respiratory issues

166
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:44,806
The fog is different
from the one we usually use

167
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,351
and when I breathe it in
it makes it hard to breathe

168
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,186
Things like that

169
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,981
I'm gonna go to my room
take some meds, and get some sleep

170
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:03,116
I think I'm getting an idea
of how to do the concert

171
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,370
It's my first time doing a concert
on my own

172
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,705
so I have no idea
what kind of reaction I'll get

173
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,251
I just need to do a good job
The preparations are all done

174
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,727
It's my first time performing alone

175
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,355
Before, I always had the members

176
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,983
So if I wasn't feeling well...

177
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:40,069
If I had a hoarse throat like today
or I wasn't feeling well

178
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,573
the other members were there
so I never felt anxious

179
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,575
or thought about making a mistake

180
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,621
But for this concert, I'm all alone

181
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,706
and my biggest concern is my voice

182
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,167
No matter how fit I am
I'm still human, so...

183
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,463
I just keep thinking I have to do better

184
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,507
Of course, I always did my best
every single moment

185
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,347
[Trivia 轉: Seesaw]

186
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,384

[People Pt.2 (feat. IU)]

191
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,477
You'll all sing along with me, right?

192
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,105
I'll look forward to it

193
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,316
Should we start?

194
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,195
One, two, three, hey

195
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:20,008
After performing "People Pt.2"
there's something I always say

196
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,553
He's my brother

197
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:28,267
Shout out to j-hope!

198
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:54,376
Our Hobi who creates our awesome choreo
and Seokjin!

199
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,714
I just want to say thank you

200
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:03,051
When I perform this song
it always feels like Hobi is with me

201
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,388
Okay, everyone

202
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,142
It's finally time

203
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,231
The easygoing section is over

204
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,946
On the prompter over here

205
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,073
it says "You must really like
easygoing songs

206
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,242
like 'Seesaw' or 'People'"

207
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,744
but when I asked yesterday
everyone went like this

208
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,749
That doesn't mean
you don't like those songs, right?

209
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,836
You like them

210
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,087
but there are songs you like even better

211
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,840
That's how I'll take it

212
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:46,512
At SUGA's concert
you have to let your hair down and go wild

213
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,222
But today, let's keep it tied up, okay?

214
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,517
And also, you have to get ready to jump

215
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,938
I'm gonna give it my all today

216
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,191
Today's the last day

217
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,362
and I'm planning not to talk
for the next three days

218
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,910
Everyone, are you ready
to do that?

219
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,455
People on the right, you ready?

220
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,041

221
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,335
People on the left, you ready?

222
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,631
Then make some noise!

223
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,885
Everyone, the moment
you've been waiting for is here

224
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,556
Let me hear you swear out loud!

226
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,571
Are you ready?

227
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,337
All together!

228
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,974
Let's go!

229
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,312
Jung Kook wants join in

230
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:28,150
I heard that since he's starting
his own promotions

231
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,903
he must've found his motivation

232
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,366
He wants to be in the concert

233
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,701
and the timing to have a guest on

234
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,080
is after "Burn It"

235
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,335
-Then, we're doing "Burn It" together?
-Yes

236
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,588
No, the black one is mine
What's this?

237
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,338
It's Jimin's

238
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,798
-Jimin's?
-Yes

239
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,383
The black one?

240
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,509
Just get me anything that's purple

241
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,136
-Is this the documentary?
-Yes

242
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:56,970
Great to see you

243
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,147
Are you going to wear an in-ear today...

244
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:20,911
Great job, everyone

245
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,040
Time to do "Burn It" now

246
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,628
Oops

247
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,804
YunKi! Give him a shout-out

248
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,377
YunKi, why is the diction
so unclear?

249
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,015
What time is practice today?

250
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,433
It's at 19:30

251
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:26,309
19:30

252
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,769
Do I have to go right after the interview?

253
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,770
You have to go right away

254
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,899
I heard that YunKi isn't here yet

255
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,161
-Done
-Wow, done

256
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,370
-Great job, guys
-Thanks

257
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,038
You're late, you're late

258
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,958
I was in a meeting at the agency, dude

259
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,543
-I wasn't playing
-Hey, we have matching T-shirts

260
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,836
Are they the same?

261
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,046
Matching T-shirts

262
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,215
Twins

263
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,633
I'm glad I wore this

264
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,594
-Did you practice "Seven"?
-Yes

265
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,887
You're doing "Seven" with a live session?

266
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,555
-Yeah
-It's not MR?

267
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,476
Don't you think you should
get a haircut now?

268
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,324
I think I got up at 10:00

269
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,491
-You got up at 10:00?
-Yes

270
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,911
I went to bed at 07:00
and got up at 10:00

271
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,627
He's here

272
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:38,298
-Hello
-It's the most cameras ever

273
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,174
What are you gonna sing?

274
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,343
-Song from the next album
-"Strange"

275
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,636
I'm doing it with YunKi

276
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,678
At the end

277
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,806
It's a pre-release then?

278
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,141
That's what he said

279
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,478
Should we give it a go and sing it?

280
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,021
-Are you done?
-Yeah

281
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:53,939
I was waiting for you

282
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,523
Good work, everyone

283
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,942
Bye

284
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,443
He waited for you just for that?

285
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,072
Jung Kook said he's gonna listen in
before leaving

286
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:04,574
A new song

287
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,952
My voice isn't warmed up
so I'll join in halfway through

288
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,662
I was on my way out
but I got curious

289
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,915
Are you gonna use the stand mic?

290
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:12,707
Yes

291
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,770
You can just take it out and move around

292
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,106
-Oh, okay
-But, that song...

293
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,274
But the stage is kind of small

294
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,484
Do you think it'll be better
just standing?

295
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,069
-Let's see how it looks at the rehearsal
-Okay

296
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,946
You can also do "Come back to me"

297
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,072
Okay

298
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,573
With a band

299
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,492
-I do have the MR too
-Okay

300
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,327
If you can play that for me

301
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,289
I'll sing blah blah blah

302
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,874
-I think layering it would be okay too
-Hello

303
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,043
Won't the MR sound shaky?

304
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,169
Won't the MR sound shaky?

305
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,548
I'm finally enlisting

306
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,843
Even if I do, you'll come back
to see me, right?

307
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,994
The sources are acoustic

308
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,911
The sources are all real

309
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,289
If you need a band
you can layer more sound

310
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,416
It sounds more dynamic
and the damping is better too

311
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,003
You got all the chords?

312
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,671
What kind of sound...

313
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,341
Or just take a listen right now

314
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,967
He got all the chords

315
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,177
He got all the chords

316
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,640
-Let's give it a go
-Let's take a listen

317
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,810
It'd be nice to have sound layered
at the venue

318
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,938
Just take a listen here
and see how it feels

319
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,065
-Just listen
-Okay

320
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,149
He picked up all the chords

321
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,776
-Already?
-For real? Is that possible?

322
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,089
It'd be nice to layer more sound
at the venue

323
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,591
Yeah, it sounds a lot better

324
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,094
Since your source
is an acoustic source anyway

325
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,179
there won't be that big of a difference

326
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,390
The setup is still--

327
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,350
He just got the chords
after listening to it once, so...

328
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,310
-If you need it
-Okay

329
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,772
They, let's run through "Strange"
one last time

330
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,940
then we'll end the practice

331
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,069
Gosh, Jimin is the biggest concern
but he didn't come

332
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,530
What are you doing with Jimin?

333
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,323
Me? "Tony Montana"

334
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,908
You're really doing "Tony Montana"?

335
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,244
I didn't think you would

336
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,245
I didn't either

337
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,670
Second

338
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,507
"Which BTS member did you contact
most recently?"

339
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:55,221
I talked to Jimin this morning

340
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,891
"Tony Montana"

341
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:58,808
"Tony Montana"?

342
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,269
He was freaking out

343
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,817
I'll be performing at SUGA's concert

344
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,239
which is such a huge honor

345
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,659
SUGA's concert is coming to an end

346
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,703
without a flaw

347
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,626
so I'll make sure not to
mess anything up

348
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,339
When I go to his concert this time

349
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,175
it'll be my third time
watching his concert

350
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,388
Gosh

351
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,807
I see a lot of friendly faces here

352
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,976
-I...
-You play the guitar sitting down?

353
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,354
Yeah, something like that

354
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,396
Just watch

355
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,941
That'll be a good time for me
to use the restroom

356
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,652
Just make sure you're there when

357
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,613
the camera is on you

358
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,990
I don't care if you go out or not

359
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,034
Just be there for the camera, okay?

360
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,997
Let's get one of you alone, SUGA

361
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:03,873
Move it

362
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:22,433
I feel alone without our members on stage

363
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,687
(He's) come to my concert, in here

364
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,440
Where are you?
Where are you, Jimin? Where are you?

365
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,500
He's good. He's definitely good

366
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,170
-He's good
-You get our reaction, right?

367
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,967
But I'm not going to act like this
in front of him later

368
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,803
He'll be expecting it though

369
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,306
He'll get too cocky

370
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,265
He was really cool

371
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,203
It's been a while since I've had
so much fun

372
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,497
I'm bummed
we can't do "Set Me Free Pt.2"

373
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,290
Yeah

374
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,333
I'm still bummed

375
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,793
That's it for the dancing

376
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,294
Okay

377
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,462
Great job, everyone

378
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,755
Great job

379
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,552
How did I sing like that?

380
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,639
Should we rehearse "Tony Montana"?

381
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,477
-Okay
-Do you need the lyrics?

382
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,270
Of course not

383
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,246
"That's ha me"

384
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,206
-"Ha"
-Yeah

385
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,459
-Jimin, you wanna try that all the way to the end?
-Uh, okay

386
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,671
That's true, that's true

387
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,674

now at Gymnastics Arena

388
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,094

You curse

390
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,142
Still my... Still my...

391
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,311
Was it "Still my spot?"

392
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,105
"Still my position"?

393
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,773
"Still my spot"?

394
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,774
"At my core"!

395
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,276
At my core, I'm still an idol

396
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,447
The result is three Billboards
That's true

397
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,998
Then say hi

398
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,208
then we high-five

399
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,960
No, this is the ending

400
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,086
We do this

401
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,505
then I'll move out
and you say a few words

402
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,718
You're not even introducing me?
You just walk off the stage?

403
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,636
No, you do whatever you want

404
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,012
Everyone knows you're Jimin

405
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,598
During the songs and performances

406
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,642
your diction is really good

407
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:15,732
But when you're talking
you have this certain vibe

408
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,649
A sloppy vibe?

409
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,485
-Something like that
-Okay

410
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,570
Just pay attention to that

411
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,988

412
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,698

-And for Jimin

413
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,700
-"Hello"
-Let's see how well you do

414
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,909
Today, Jimin

415
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,910
was so worried

416
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,620
he rehearsed six times

417
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,290
But when I got up on stage
it wasn't cringey at all and it was nice

418
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:32,957
Oh, really?

419
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,208
-Yes
-Just do it like that

420
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,128
-You make it cringey
-But you laugh too in between

421
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,883
-You're kind of--
-That's true, that's true

422
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,509
-As long as you don't laugh
-I... I...

423
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,136
When I'm doing my thing
then look over to you--

424
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,804
I'm looking at you
because I'm proud of you

425
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,390
-You should go on tour too
-What?

426
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,850
If you go on tour, I'll go with you

427
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,478
For real?

428
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,938
Then you have to sing all the songs
with me from start to finish

You're trying to get a free ride

430
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,108
-Don't feel intimidated
-Got it

431
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,026
Scared?

432
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,363
YunKi is so popular

433
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,868
I'll do my best to learn a lot from him
so that I can become an awesome artist

445
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,834
to congratulate his encore concert

446
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,502

I don't want to take up
too much time

451
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,897
but just performing one song
would be a bummer

452
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,028
so I'll perform one more song

This is Jimin

470
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:09,046
I've done several concerts too
but usually

471
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:13,217
when guests come on
they introduce you and stuff

472
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,012
but he just walked off

473
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,599
That's just YunKi's style

475
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,355

Thanks to SUGA

I get to be on stage

480
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:50,254
and see all of you

481
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,798
I'm so happy and thankful

482
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:00,055
Everyone, are you having fun
at SUGA's concert?

483
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,352
I've been watching him

484
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,771
ever since he started preparing for this

485
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:12,067
He's been doing such a great job
since the beginning

486
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,946
He felt a lot of pressure
and worked so hard on it

487
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:20,701
but he's doing so well that I don't even
get why he was so worried

488
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:24,955
He's swearing a lot too

489
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,501
I was like "Isn't that too aggressive?"

490
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,337
but you seem to like it more

491
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,716
As long as you like it, I'm good

492
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:39,428
Anyway, I'm gonna sing

493
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:46,226

494
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:49,980

496
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:16,465
Ah, ah, can you hear me?

497
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:20,302

I'm gonna sing you my song and...

Should I just stay?

510
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:17,651
I'm gonna head back in

511
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:21,947

Hello

519
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:43,012
It's been so long since I've been on stage

520
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:51,938
First of all, SUGA is working so hard
on his own

521
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,232
and it's such an honor to be

522
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:57,068
at the finale of this long journey

523
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:00,822
You're all happy
to be with SUGA too, right?

524
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,452
I'd also like to tell you about my hair

525
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,623
I've been getting
five to six calls a day about it

526
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:13,960
but it has nothing to do
with my enlistment

527
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:18,840
The announcement will be made
when it's time

528
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,217
but I just wanted to say
I'm not going yet

529
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:25,597
It was so hot
and that's why I got a buzz cut

530
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,976
Also, I need to tell you

531
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,395
that this is probably
my last live performance

532
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:34,063
before serving in the military

533
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:39,152
so that's why I prepared a gift for you

534
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:44,115
I'm sure a lot of you
are expecting me to sing

535
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:46,326

536
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,163
but after working on "Indigo"

537
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,624
I started on my next project right away

538
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,792

It's a must

568
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:22,050
When going on tour
it's an absolute must

569
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:25,637
When kicking off your tour
the first city is really important

570
01:51:26,388 --> 01:51:30,141
The reaction of the audience
in the first city

571
01:51:30,141 --> 01:51:32,352
tells you how the reaction will be
all throughout the tour

572
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,561
For example, in the past

573
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:36,189
when we kicked off our tour in the U.S.
then went on to Europe

574
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:37,357
When we had our stadium tour...

575
01:51:38,983 --> 01:51:41,569
We maintained the same vibe
all the way to Europe

576
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:43,988
then came back to Korea
and then went to Japan

577
01:51:43,988 --> 01:51:45,782
By the time we got to Japan
it became different

578
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:49,828
We got off to a great start
with the first concert in New York

579
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:51,454
It was a great start

580
01:51:51,454 --> 01:51:54,082
Of course, I worked super hard

581
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:56,876
I'm gonna keep going with this vibe
in the U.S.

582
01:51:58,253 --> 01:52:02,048
Once this tour is over
I think I'll feel a little relieved

583
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:05,385
When I go up on stage

584
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:08,388
I always kind of think
"I know I'll be awesome"

585
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:10,890
But when I was preparing for this

586
01:52:12,934 --> 01:52:16,354
I never once thought
"I think I'm gonna mess up"

587
01:52:16,354 --> 01:52:18,898
Like my voice cracking

588
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:21,484
or getting the lyrics wrong

589
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:25,155
I feel like I've leveled up in a way

590
01:52:26,781 --> 01:52:28,742
When people saw my concert schedule

591
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,119
they all talked about
how I might die doing it

592
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:32,662
But as I was preparing for it

593
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:34,789
I didn't think it'd be that hard

594
01:52:35,874 --> 01:52:38,168
and now that I'm on the road
it really isn't that hard

595
01:52:40,462 --> 01:52:44,048
I did work out a lot
while preparing for this

596
01:52:46,384 --> 01:52:49,053
and the staff and I prepared a lot

597
01:52:49,053 --> 01:52:51,556
to be ready for different situations

598
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:54,517
so I don't find anything inconvenient

599
01:52:54,851 --> 01:52:58,188
I had a lot of fun preparing for it

600
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:03,902

Oh, this is customized too

My spare

603
01:53:20,877 --> 01:53:24,547
When performing alone
I need to play an instrument

604
01:53:24,547 --> 01:53:27,926
for there to be more to see
production-wise

605
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:42,482
When touring with BTS

606
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:45,819
I didn't like going outside

607
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:48,321
I'd always order-in
or order room service

608
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:52,408
But this time, I'm gonna make
restaurant reservations and eat good food

609
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:57,705
And also get guitar lessons
and keyboard lessons too

-No, it's not

647

719
02:19:37,827 --> 02:19:38,912
Up front, are you ready?

720
02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:43,375
On the right, are you ready?

721
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:49,422
Then

722
02:20:11,778 --> 02:20:12,946
here's the last song

723
02:20:15,323 --> 02:20:16,491
Let's go

724
02:20:24,874 --> 02:20:31,381
[AMYGDALA]

725
02:20:37,637 --> 02:20:38,596
All together

726
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:08,157
At first

727
02:25:10,159 --> 02:25:11,119
I just...

728
02:25:11,869 --> 02:25:14,956
I wanted to give ARMY
that waited

729
02:25:14,956 --> 02:25:18,334
through the COVID-19 pandemic

730
02:25:18,751 --> 02:25:20,336
the certainty that we'd return

731
02:25:20,336 --> 02:25:25,508
so they could endure
through the rest of our break

732
02:25:25,508 --> 02:25:28,136
That's how I started this

733
02:25:29,929 --> 02:25:32,306
When the pandemic
started to clear up once and for all

734
02:25:32,682 --> 02:25:36,185
I started with the thought that
through this concert

735
02:25:37,228 --> 02:25:39,480
I could relieve some of their stress
and provide something for them

736
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:41,482
to make up for the future
two to three years of our hiatus

737
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:45,695
It would've been the best with all seven of us
but that wasn't possible

738
02:25:45,695 --> 02:25:47,572
so I did a tour on my own

739
02:25:48,406 --> 02:25:52,452
I think that artists
are just people that perform

740
02:25:52,452 --> 02:25:55,079
They can make music

741
02:25:56,205 --> 02:25:57,415
they can put on events

742
02:25:57,415 --> 02:26:00,042
and they can film advertisements
but...

743
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:04,964
I think the job of an artist
becomes complete through concerts

744
02:29:22,036 --> 02:29:25,748
[D-Day]

745
02:29:33,756 --> 02:29:34,924
Are you ready?

746
02:29:39,512 --> 02:29:41,055
Then, let's go

747
02:29:41,055 --> 02:29:42,139
Here we go

02:32:22,174 --> 02:32:23,217
Louder!

751
02:33:10,431 --> 02:33:13,601
Let me introduce the band members

752
02:33:15,019 --> 02:33:18,439
Everyone, attention please
for the band members!

753
02:33:22,151 --> 02:33:25,321
Guitar, Shinwon

754
02:33:49,637 --> 02:33:52,681

02:38:00,053 --> 02:38:04,766
Make some noise!

803
02:38:27,039 --> 02:38:30,083
Leaving always makes you
a little bit sad

804
02:38:30,083 --> 02:38:31,418
You want to do a little more

805
02:38:34,755 --> 02:38:39,676
This whole month
feels like a dream

806
02:38:40,302 --> 02:38:41,803
I feel like I'm walking on air

807
02:38:44,473 --> 02:38:48,310
It started with, "Will I really be able to
pull this off?" and came this far

808
02:38:57,653 --> 02:39:00,155
The weather in LA hasn't been
that sunny while we've been here this time

809
02:39:00,155 --> 02:39:02,491
It keeps looking like it'll rain

810
02:39:04,952 --> 02:39:08,080
When do you think you'll get to
come back to the U.S.?

811
02:39:09,248 --> 02:39:12,042
Probably in 2025

812
02:39:12,793 --> 02:39:15,671
I have to go

813
02:39:17,214 --> 02:39:20,551
and fulfill my military service now

814
02:39:21,885 --> 02:39:23,804
The seven of us should come together
once we're all back

815
02:39:25,931 --> 02:39:28,016
We should do a stadium tour then

816
02:39:30,894 --> 02:39:32,271
In 2025...

817
02:39:41,071 --> 02:39:43,949
I can't imagine what it'll be like

818
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:47,452
I can't even begin to guess
what 2025 will be like

819
02:39:48,829 --> 02:39:50,289
A lot of time will have passed

820
02:39:53,083 --> 02:39:54,084
I wonder how things will be

821
02:39:55,586 --> 02:39:57,546
I have no idea what kind of
promotions we'll be doing

822
02:39:57,546 --> 02:40:02,926
since everything changes so fast each year

823
02:40:06,555 --> 02:40:09,850
I have absolutely no idea
how we'll be working in two years

824
02:40:09,850 --> 02:40:13,145
or what kind of music we'll be doing

825
02:40:13,145 --> 02:40:16,481
or how we'll be touring

826
02:40:24,823 --> 02:40:28,327
If I could just master the guitar
while on tour...

827
02:41:12,913 --> 02:41:14,831
My guitar teacher taught me so well

828
02:41:14,831 --> 02:41:15,749
I feel so proud

829
02:41:18,794 --> 02:41:20,921
But don't you think I play more easily now
with less power?

830
02:41:20,921 --> 02:41:21,505
Yeah

831
02:41:21,505 --> 02:41:24,049
You're much more relaxed now

832
02:41:24,049 --> 02:41:28,178
You used to play with so much power...

833
02:41:28,178 --> 02:41:29,888
-In the beginning
-When you first started playing the guitar

834
02:41:31,682 --> 02:41:35,519
Even when we were rehearsing
it was like...

835
02:41:35,519 --> 02:41:38,689
You were nervous and tensed up

836
02:41:38,689 --> 02:41:40,565
but you got over that during the tour

837
02:41:40,565 --> 02:41:41,108
I know

838
02:41:41,108 --> 02:41:43,402
-Play out a beat
-Okay

839
02:41:45,153 --> 02:41:46,988
It's "C" anyway. Start with "C"

840
02:41:46,988 --> 02:41:48,156
Set up the 808 beat

841
02:41:48,156 --> 02:41:49,282
I'll make the rest

842
02:41:55,414 --> 02:41:59,292
No, let's make the first 808 long

843
02:42:02,587 --> 02:42:04,172
-Oh, nice
-Nice

844
02:42:04,172 --> 02:42:05,048
Let's go

845
02:42:14,599 --> 02:42:15,517
Nice, nice

846
02:42:18,019 --> 02:42:18,979
This sounds awesome

847
02:42:19,396 --> 02:42:20,897
Now I'll...

848
02:42:20,897 --> 02:42:22,858
Gosh, our captain

849
02:42:22,858 --> 02:42:23,734
What was it just now?

850
02:42:25,944 --> 02:42:26,903
Wow, nice

851
02:42:29,281 --> 02:42:30,699
Yijeong, I think it's ready

852
02:42:30,699 --> 02:42:32,075
-Okay
-Keyboard, go

853
02:42:34,786 --> 02:42:35,954
I think we can do this!

854
02:42:39,958 --> 02:42:40,876
Hey, we did it!

855
02:42:40,876 --> 02:42:42,753
When we listen to it tomorrow
we might be like, "Huh? What's this?"

856
02:42:43,795 --> 02:42:45,255
You have to listen to it much later

857
02:42:45,255 --> 02:42:46,173
It's better to listen to it
after a while

858
02:42:46,173 --> 02:42:47,841
Saying, "We wrote something like this?"

859
02:42:51,887 --> 02:42:52,721
We got it

860
02:43:00,645 --> 02:43:02,022
-I think it's nice
-Here we go

861
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:05,817
Intro

862
02:43:07,778 --> 02:43:08,987
Sounds awesome

863
02:43:10,280 --> 02:43:12,282
Who wrote this theme?
I did

864
02:43:12,949 --> 02:43:14,201
Let's go, let's go

865
02:43:14,201 --> 02:43:14,951
Genius?

866
02:43:16,244 --> 02:43:18,914
I think it could reach the top 80
on the Billboard

867
02:43:18,914 --> 02:43:19,956
You already paved the road

868
02:43:25,337 --> 02:43:29,049
When I'm working with him
it doesn't feel like work

869
02:43:29,716 --> 02:43:32,511
I mean, it does feel like work
in the last stages of the album

870
02:43:32,511 --> 02:43:34,054
when we're doing arrangements and stuff

871
02:43:34,054 --> 02:43:35,222
That's when you'd be on the edge

872
02:43:35,222 --> 02:43:39,893
When I get sensitive...
He doesn't get sensitive but I do

873
02:43:39,893 --> 02:43:40,977
We just keep at it

874
02:43:43,104 --> 02:43:45,774
For the last one, a folk song
A genuine folk song

875
02:43:45,774 --> 02:43:48,193
Do one in a Kim Kwangseok style
and wrap it up

876
02:43:49,069 --> 02:43:51,988
Just get the guitar
Get the guitar and record a guide

877
02:44:07,879 --> 02:44:09,923
-Suddenly turned into a NELL song
-Yeah

878
02:44:12,884 --> 02:44:14,135
Okay, nice

879
02:44:15,011 --> 02:44:18,223
My ultimate goal is for
all seven members

880
02:44:18,223 --> 02:44:19,349
to just play like this

881
02:44:20,350 --> 02:44:22,477
They're all really good
They write good melodies

882
02:44:33,572 --> 02:44:38,118
I'm glad that we got to film
a bit of the process yesterday

883
02:44:38,118 --> 02:44:40,328
That's how Yijeong and I always work

884
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:43,248
We just chat

885
02:44:43,248 --> 02:44:46,418
saying, "What should we do?"

886
02:44:46,418 --> 02:44:49,212
"Just try something. Play a drum beat"
And then

887
02:44:50,338 --> 02:44:51,840
a song just comes out

888
02:44:54,259 --> 02:44:56,845
I always said I was going to do
band music

889
02:44:56,845 --> 02:44:59,014
once I'm in my mid to late 30s

890
02:45:00,098 --> 02:45:04,811
So I was just planning out
a mini album

891
02:45:04,811 --> 02:45:08,398
An acoustic mini album

892
02:45:08,398 --> 02:45:11,359
And one with really intense hip-hop songs

893
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:15,155
If I do that, I think my concerts
will become really diverse

894
02:45:16,364 --> 02:45:20,368
It'd be the same production
but with a completely different setlist

895
02:45:20,368 --> 02:45:22,579
Have you ever been to a concert like that?

896
02:45:22,746 --> 02:45:26,416
On some days, it'd be really acoustic

897
02:45:26,416 --> 02:45:29,711
Of course, we'd announce it in advance

898
02:45:29,711 --> 02:45:31,379
What version of the concert it is

899
02:45:31,379 --> 02:45:33,548
Version A concert
An acoustic version concert

900
02:45:34,299 --> 02:45:36,885
Since I have a lot of songs
there's so much I can do

901
02:45:38,011 --> 02:45:41,139
Honestly, in the case of this concert

902
02:45:41,139 --> 02:45:42,599
I wasn't nervous

903
02:45:42,599 --> 02:45:44,809
I'm not sure whether
it's because I prepared so much

904
02:45:45,143 --> 02:45:46,853
or because I worked hard

905
02:45:47,354 --> 02:45:49,356
We did run-throughs at least
three times a week

906
02:45:49,356 --> 02:45:52,567
When you think about the
preparation period

907
02:45:52,567 --> 02:45:54,903
the tour has gone on
for a bit longer than two months now

908
02:45:54,903 --> 02:45:56,905
but it will last three to four months

909
02:45:57,572 --> 02:45:59,115
Since we've performed so much together

910
02:45:59,115 --> 02:46:00,825
and prepared so much

911
02:46:00,825 --> 02:46:02,661
I honestly think that was
a very good thing

912
02:46:02,661 --> 02:46:04,245
That goes for the collaboration
with the band members too

913
02:46:04,829 --> 02:46:07,624
There were many things I wanted to do
during the tour

914
02:46:07,624 --> 02:46:11,044
Honestly, there were many parts
that I didn't have to sing

915
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:16,716
I often thought
"I really worked hard on this tour"

916
02:46:17,717 --> 02:46:21,554
I always say this
but I'm someone who loves doing concerts

917
02:46:21,554 --> 02:46:25,392
The biggest reason I became a singer
was to do concerts

918
02:46:26,101 --> 02:46:28,478
I love being on stage

919
02:46:30,397 --> 02:46:33,400
If I ever feel like I can't go up on stage
because it's too tough for me

920
02:46:33,400 --> 02:46:35,402
or I don't feel like going up on stage
because I'm not feeling well

921
02:46:35,402 --> 02:46:38,238
I think that's when I need to stop
being a singer

922
02:46:38,863 --> 02:46:42,993
I always need to be thankful that
there are stages I can perform on

923
02:46:42,993 --> 02:46:46,079
and that there are people
who seek me out

924
02:46:46,079 --> 02:46:49,874
Always doing your best on stage

925
02:46:49,874 --> 02:46:51,167
is a given for me

926
02:46:57,465 --> 02:46:58,508
This is the end

927
02:46:58,508 --> 02:47:00,927
You all did a great job
Our dancers and the band

928
02:47:02,429 --> 02:47:04,264
Thank you

929
02:47:04,264 --> 02:47:05,640
Team SUGA is the best

930
02:47:09,269 --> 02:47:12,856
The encore concert of my first solo tour
is really coming to an end

931
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:17,694
I've learned so much
through these concerts

932
02:47:18,820 --> 02:47:22,574
But most of all

933
02:47:22,574 --> 02:47:25,285
what I remember the most

934
02:47:25,285 --> 02:47:27,871
are the happy looks on your faces

935
02:47:31,541 --> 02:47:32,876
How was it?

936
02:47:35,170 --> 02:47:36,296
How was it?

937
02:47:38,339 --> 02:47:39,799
How was it really?

938
02:47:41,843 --> 02:47:48,266
If it was great, make some noise!

939
02:47:54,689 --> 02:47:56,191
Doesn't sound so loud

940
02:47:56,858 --> 02:47:58,943
It's the last day today
Doesn't sound that loud, right?

941
02:48:01,237 --> 02:48:05,408
One more time, make some noise!

942
02:48:07,952 --> 02:48:09,245
Everyone

943
02:48:11,206 --> 02:48:12,999
It's so hot. Hot, hot, hot

944
02:48:33,728 --> 02:48:36,648
Everyone, you had fun, right?

945
02:48:39,400 --> 02:48:40,735
What? Did something happen?

946
02:48:41,861 --> 02:48:42,862
No, right?

947
02:48:43,738 --> 02:48:48,076
Anyway, we had a long run
of 28 concerts...

948
02:48:48,076 --> 02:48:51,704
One more time! One more time!
One more time! One more time!

949
02:48:57,919 --> 02:49:01,214
To ARMY who've been with me
all the way through 28 concerts

950
02:49:01,214 --> 02:49:03,633
and ARMY who are watching
the live streaming online

951
02:49:03,633 --> 02:49:08,096
I just want to say
thank you so so much

952
02:49:09,305 --> 02:49:11,474
When I first started out...

953
02:49:11,474 --> 02:49:14,686
I was thinking about it earlier

954
02:49:14,686 --> 02:49:18,398
and I really worried about whether
I could actually pull this off

955
02:49:18,398 --> 02:49:21,693
but I had so much fun
and it made me so happy

956
02:49:21,693 --> 02:49:24,195
I'm really glad that we made it to the end

957
02:49:24,195 --> 02:49:25,613
without any mishaps

958
02:49:26,865 --> 02:49:29,534
Thank you so much, ARMY

959
02:49:31,995 --> 02:49:33,288
Also, today was the best

960
02:49:35,373 --> 02:49:37,041
Today is number one

961
02:49:39,586 --> 02:49:42,005
I'll give you 30 "Well done" stickers

962
02:49:44,674 --> 02:49:45,717
But!

963
02:49:47,302 --> 02:49:50,889
We have one last song left

964
02:49:53,349 --> 02:49:56,477
What? What? I can't do more
just because you don't want it to end

965
02:49:58,855 --> 02:50:04,068
It's the last, last, last song
For real, the final song

966
02:50:04,068 --> 02:50:07,906
Thank you so much for being here
with me at this concert

967
02:50:10,408 --> 02:50:13,661
The next time I perform in Seoul

968
02:50:13,661 --> 02:50:16,706
I cautiously predict that it'll be with

969
02:50:19,709 --> 02:50:25,673
all seven of our members on stage

970
02:50:28,635 --> 02:50:30,511
Here's the final song

971
02:50:32,597 --> 02:50:37,560
Please have fun until the end
Thank you

972
02:50:38,853 --> 02:50:40,480
Let's go!

973
02:51:05,046 --> 02:51:09,717
[INTRO : Never Mind]

974
02:52:52,445 --> 02:52:54,739
If you think you're gonna crash

975
02:52:56,199 --> 02:52:57,325
accelerate harder

976
02:52:58,284 --> 02:53:01,079
I'm always cheering for you

977
02:53:01,079 --> 02:53:02,163
Never mind

978
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:18,221
Min YunKi, I love you!

979
02:53:29,899 --> 02:53:35,405
Today, I'm gonna sing this song
with a happy face

980
02:53:35,405 --> 02:53:36,406
Let's go

981
02:53:43,663 --> 02:53:47,375
[The Last]

982
02:58:42,169 --> 02:58:44,088
Thank you, ARMY

983
02:59:04,358 --> 02:59:05,401
Thank you

984
02:59:12,783 --> 02:59:14,034
Thank you

985
02:59:32,428 --> 02:59:33,471
Thank you

986
02:59:46,692 --> 02:59:48,277
Thank you, everyone

987
02:59:58,037 --> 02:59:59,497
Thank you, everyone

988
03:00:18,641 --> 03:00:21,477
The D-DAY TOUR is really over

989
03:00:23,103 --> 03:00:27,608
I've always wanted to tell you

990
03:00:27,608 --> 03:00:28,776
how thankful I am

991
03:00:30,110 --> 03:00:31,612
Thank you, everyone!

992
03:00:54,718 --> 03:00:56,136
Thank you

993
03:00:57,596 --> 03:00:58,806
and I love you

994
03:01:23,956 --> 03:01:26,041
When I face the audience

995
03:01:26,041 --> 03:01:28,043
I see their faces

996
03:01:29,211 --> 03:01:34,008
and they look so happy

997
03:01:35,009 --> 03:01:38,262
I'm not sure I deserve that

998
03:01:38,262 --> 03:01:40,806
I do this hoping that

999
03:01:40,806 --> 03:01:45,477
everyone feels good and happy

1000
03:01:46,312 --> 03:01:48,939
because I'm so happy
when I perform on stage

1001
03:01:49,899 --> 03:01:52,401
A singer has to be happy and enjoy it

1002
03:01:52,401 --> 03:01:55,738
for the audience to be happy and enjoy it

1003
03:01:56,822 --> 03:02:02,453
So I looked like such a happy person
during this tour

1004
03:03:18,696 --> 03:03:19,697
Thank you

1005
03:03:20,948 --> 03:03:21,824
D-DAY, done
