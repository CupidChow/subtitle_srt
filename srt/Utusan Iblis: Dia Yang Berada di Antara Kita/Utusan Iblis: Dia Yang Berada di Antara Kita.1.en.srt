1
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,059
Big sister!

2
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,017
Big sister!

3
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,892
Mom?

4
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:34,267
No, Mom.

5
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:35,851
Mom?

6
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:37,142
No!

7
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:38,601
Mom!

8
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,142
Big sister!

9
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,142
That's not Mom.

10
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:51,726
That's not Mom.

11
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:55,059
Sleep

12
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:59,851
Sleep, my child

13
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,309
Night falls

14
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:09,517
It's time to sleep

15
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,142
Help, Sir.

16
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:13,559
Help my daughter.

17
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:15,267
Okay, calm down, Sir.

18
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:19,934
- My daughter, Sir. Help her.
- Okay.

19
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,184
- Don't end the call.
- My daughter.

20
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,559
Our team will be there immediately.

21
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:27,726
Please tell us your location.

22
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,684
House...

23
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,351
Please help us.

24
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:37,726
Okay, Sir. Are you and your daughter
currently at a safe place?

25
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,476
Hello? Hello, Sir?

26
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:42,934
Mr. Yanto?

27
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,392
Hello, Sir?

28
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:45,976
Can you hear me?

29
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:47,434
Hello?

30
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:53,851
Dad.

31
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:52,684
Sleep

32
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:58,642
Sleep, my child

33
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:03,101
Night falls

34
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:08,559
It's time to sleep

35
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:31,101
Sir.

36
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,642
Help me, Sir.

37
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:48,934
Sleep

38
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:56,142
Sleep, my child

39
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:04,059
Night falls

40
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:11,351
Bina Prana
Mental Hospital

41
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,059
Calm down.

42
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,851
- Help!
- There's nothing up there.

43
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,309
Satan!

44
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,726
- Good afternoon, Doc.
- Good afternoon.

45
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:48,809
There are two new patients.

46
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,767
One is named Jamal.

47
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,476
The other one is from the police.

48
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,101
Please bring Patient Jamal in.

49
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:03,517
Yes, Doc.

50
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:15,309
Good afternoon, Doc.

51
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,892
I'd like to...

52
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:20,267
Sorry.

53
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:22,642
I'm going to meet the patient who came first.

54
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,184
Bring him in, please.

55
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,142
Hello, Jamal.

56
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,142
I'm Olivia.

57
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,976
Your name is Jamal. Right?

58
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,101
How are you feeling right now?

59
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,559
Something's bothering your ears?

60
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:34,976
Did you hear something?

61
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,226
I'm not a killer.

62
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:44,059
- I'm not a killer.
- Who is not a killer, Jamal?

63
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,017
Killer.

64
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,392
You're not a killer?

65
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,809
Forgive me.

66
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:50,934
I'm...

67
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,059
I'm not a killer. Forgive me.

68
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:54,642
Killer of who, Jamal?

69
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,309
- Mom. I'm not a Mom killer.
- Okay.

70
00:07:58,392 --> 00:07:59,434
I'm not...

71
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,267
You're not a Mom killer.

72
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:03,392
Is that what you mean?

73
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:07,767
- Killer.
- Forgive me.

74
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:08,892
Jamal.

75
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,226
Killer.

76
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:11,934
Can you hear me?

77
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,851
I'm not a Mom killer.

78
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:19,851
I'm not a Mom killer!

79
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:20,976
Jamal.

80
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,142
Calm down. Focus. Look into my eyes.

81
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:27,684
Jamal. Calm down. You're okay here.

82
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,601
Look at me. Focus. Jamal.

83
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,851
Forgive me!

84
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,517
- Mom killer... Calm down, Jamal.
- I'm not a killer!

85
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:39,351
- Nurse! Nurse Yuni?
- Forgive me! I'm not a killer!

86
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:40,684
Jamal, calm down.

87
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:43,642
Please bring him out. Calm him down.

88
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:46,476
Bring him to a special room.
I'll evaluate him further later.

89
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,767
I'm not a killer!

90
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:54,892
I'm not a killer!

91
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,267
Forgive me!

92
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,017
Doc, sorry.

93
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:06,142
I don't mean to burden you even more.

94
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,309
But I'm here...

95
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,476
...to ask for your help...

96
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,142
...to handle my case.

97
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:16,267
What case?

98
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,309
Her name is Cantika.

99
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,684
She slaughtered her family three days ago.

100
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:26,934
Based on our team's interrogation,
she has a mental disorder.

101
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,351
That's why I brought her here to you.

102
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:37,934
I hope you can help find out her hidden motive.

103
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:40,892
Is it really a mental disorder?

104
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,142
Or is there something else?

105
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,142
Hello, Cantika.

106
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,142
I'm Olivia.

107
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,851
Your name is Cantika, right?

108
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:17,476
Do you know why you're here?

109
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,976
How are you feeling right now?

110
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,934
Are you comfortable being here?

111
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,392
Cantika?

112
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,017
Sleep

113
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,101
Sleep, my child

114
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:46,184
Night falls

115
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:50,851
It's time to sleep

116
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,476
What song is that, Cantika?

117
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,434
It sounds sad.

118
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:56,892
What does the song remind you of?

119
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:00,851
- Something or maybe someone?
- Sleep

120
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:06,351
- Sleep, my child
- Is that the song you always sing to your child?

121
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:10,142
Night falls

122
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:14,309
It's time to sleep

123
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:17,309
Can you tell me about your relationship with your child?

124
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,767
How's your relationship with your child?

125
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,017
What do you mean?

126
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,601
How's your relationship with your child?

127
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,267
What, Cantika?

128
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:41,517
How's your relationship with your child?

129
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:43,601
How's your relationship with your child?

130
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:46,559
How's your relationship with your child?

131
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,142
How's your relationship with your child?

132
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:57,601
How is it?

133
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,892
Please take care of the patient.

134
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,767
Doc, how's Cantika?

135
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,142
I'm not the right person to help your case.

136
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:11,476
Wait, Doc, it has only been a few minutes.

137
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,517
Can you make that verdict already?

138
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,101
What actually happened inside?

139
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:21,184
I haven't been able to make a diagnosis
of what kind of disorder she has.

140
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,476
But based on my evaluation,
she showed an agressive behavior.

141
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:30,351
And in my opinion,
she's not pretending to have a mental disorder.

142
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:33,559
I'll refer her to another doctor
for further evaluation.

143
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,392
- Excuse me.
- Doc.

144
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,434
Hold on to that for now.

145
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:40,851
All the information I got from my investigation
of Cantika's case is in here.

146
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,101
Just read about it first.

147
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,392
We can discuss it again tomorrow.

148
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:25,601
Sleep

149
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:30,059
Sleep, my child

150
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:39,101
Night falls

151
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:44,184
It's time to sleep

152
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:35,892
Mom?

153
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:38,351
Mom?

154
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:40,851
Mom?

155
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,184
Open the door, please.

156
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:49,684
Mom?

157
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:21,976
How's your relationship with your child?

158
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,517
How's your relationship with your child?

159
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,059
Good morning, Olivia.

160
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,851
How are you feeling today?

161
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:34,392
I'm feeling good.

162
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:37,059
Thank God. I'm happy for you.

163
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,226
What do you say, Doc?
Am I suitable to be a doctor?

164
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,351
You are.

165
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,517
How do you feel today?

166
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:52,059
I never felt this good.

167
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:55,226
That means someone is ready to move
to the general room.

168
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:58,184
That's right. But you're moving too, right?

169
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:01,142
Of course. I'm your doctor.

170
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,767
That's right. I'm the patient
and you're my doctor.

171
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:10,142
You look like you're ready for your counseling session.
Let's get started.

172
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:12,559
I'm so ready. I'm waiting for you to start.

173
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,601
Right. Hold on.

174
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:25,642
How was it, Jane?

175
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:27,684
I was so happy.

176
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,601
- Oh, yeah?
- But I tricked Dr. Olivia for a while.

177
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:33,517
Silly you.

178
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,476
It's okay to do trickery once in a while.

179
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,434
Okay then. The most important thing
is that you're happy.

180
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:40,559
Yes.

181
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,476
Because I'm going to move.

182
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,601
Right.

183
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:49,226
Nurse Yuni!

184
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:51,434
Nurse.

185
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,601
What's going on?

186
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:57,601
Nurse, I think there's something else
we need to take care of first.

187
00:19:58,892 --> 00:19:59,934
Oh dear. Okay.

188
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:05,726
Jane, I'm going to leave you here
for a moment, okay?

189
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,892
- Huh...
- Just for a moment.

190
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:09,934
- Not too long, okay?
- Okay.

191
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,059
- Just a moment.
- I'll be waiting.

192
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:13,184
Okay.

193
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:23,601
Special Patient Room
Cantika Indah K

194
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,642
You'll be dead.

195
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:43,601
You'll be dead.

196
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:48,559
You'll be dead.

197
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:51,559
Nurse!

198
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,934
Nurse!

199
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:11,726
Who was that?

200
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:13,559
Who was that?

201
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:15,101
Who was that?

202
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,684
You'll be dead.

203
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,434
The motoric function tends to be tense.

204
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:56,392
And he still feels scared.

205
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:58,726
- Okay. Keep observing.
- Alright.

206
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:01,851
Let me know about the progress before evening.

207
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:03,892
- Before evening. Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

208
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:22,851
What happened?

209
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:26,601
How could you make a wrong diagnosis?

210
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,434
In my professional opinion...

211
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,351
...Patient Jane was well enough to be moved
to the general room.

212
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:38,726
You know my track record in analyzing patients.

213
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:42,142
Yes.

214
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:44,476
I know.

215
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:48,142
And who do you think...

216
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,017
...should be responsible?

217
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:54,059
I tried to think that...

218
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:58,517
...what happened to Patient Jamal
wasn't your fault.

219
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:01,476
But with this incident...

220
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:04,517
...I got another opinion.

221
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:12,059
In two days, two patients are involved
in weird incidents.

222
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,434
And both of them are in your care.

223
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,809
The best specialist in this hospital.

224
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:24,642
If you were me...

225
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,726
...what would be your assumption?

226
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:33,517
The hospital will still
give you a memorandum, Olivia.

227
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,142
I hope you can be more responsible in the future.

228
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:40,184
My suggestion is...

229
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:43,434
...you make time to consult with your peers.

230
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:45,434
I'm fine, Sir.

231
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:47,226
I'll take my leave.

232
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:50,392
One more thing.

233
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:54,267
I ask...

234
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,476
...that you prove yourself with Patient Cantika.

235
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,684
- But...
- Dr. Olivia.

236
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:04,476
I don't want any more incident...

237
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:08,017
...that can lower this hospital's credibility.

238
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:10,142
Understood?

239
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:11,476
Yes, sir.

240
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,726
Excuse me.

241
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,059
Do you know that a hospital is a smoke-free area?

242
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:36,851
Doc.

243
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,184
How do you know I'm here?

244
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:48,767
Can you tell me about Cantika?

245
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,059
Let's talk somewhere else.

246
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:54,476
Can't we do it here?

247
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,601
So her victims are her husband and her children?

248
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:09,101
And how are they doing?

249
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,184
Why do you have to keep it a secret?

250
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:31,601
I've handled this case for a long time.

251
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:34,142
Even longer before it happened
to Cantika's family.

252
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:37,309
I think there's a reason it happened to her.

253
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,392
A long line of previous victims...

254
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:42,351
...up until Cantika.

255
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:45,934
Can you just go to the point?

256
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,101
Before...

257
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:51,101
...I followed similar cases.

258
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:53,851
Every victim, including Cantika...

259
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:56,809
...became like this due to a trigger...

260
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:59,934
...that I haven't figured out yet.

261
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,101
You mean, Cantika is also a victim?

262
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:08,101
I can't say that for sure.

263
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,892
But from the pattern I told you about...

264
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:15,184
...these killers have the same conditions.

265
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:18,684
Be it Cantika or the people from the other cases.

266
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:26,226
Okay, how can I help you?

267
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:36,184
I'm asking you to analyze
Cantika's every movement and words.

268
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:39,476
Find out the connection.

269
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,517
At least find out why she did it.

270
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,351
Because the only survivor
after the family's killing...

271
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:48,476
...is her.

272
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,559
In the cases before,
everyone had died on location.

273
00:26:52,684 --> 00:26:56,601
I need to know if it's really due
to a mental disorder or...

274
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:58,851
Or?

275
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:04,559
Possessed?

276
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:10,601
Do you realize that you didn't come to a psychic?

277
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,517
Ghosts and spirits don't exist anyway.

278
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:18,017
Okay then.

279
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:24,059
Just analyze the mental disorder.

280
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,392
If needs be, maybe you can tell me...

281
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:28,892
...what the mental disorder is...

282
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:31,809
...and what illness she has.

283
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:33,851
Let me take care of the rest.

284
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,684
Okay, I'll help with your case.

285
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:44,351
But with one condition.

286
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:46,934
What is it?

287
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,101
You don't interfere my evaluation
without my consent.

288
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:56,142
My way or none at all.

289
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,892
Deal?

290
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:09,726
We haven't introduced ourselves properly.

291
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:12,184
I'm Rendy, Doc.

292
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:14,767
Olivia. You don't need to call me Doctor.

293
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:21,142
There are two dangerous patients here.

294
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:24,184
Rifat and Dinda.

295
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:28,976
A wicked woman was born.

296
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:37,017
She has the intention to disrupt lives
in this world.

297
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:45,226
She has a vengeful intention!

298
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,184
Sorry, Doc.

299
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,601
The life in this village...

300
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:53,642
...with any way.

301
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:04,684
Rifat...

302
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,559
...has a horrible mental disorder.

303
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,684
He's diagnosed by many illness,
one of them is schizophrenia.

304
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,267
Let me go!

305
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:20,351
Let me go! Doctor!

306
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:23,017
Doctor, help me!

307
00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:27,101
Patient Dinda has a deep trauma.

308
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,892
Her mother tried to kill her.

309
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:34,059
That's why she's scared of elderly women.

310
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:36,351
Doctor, help me!

311
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,892
Help!

312
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:45,142
Doctor!

313
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,726
Hello, Cantika.

314
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,142
How are you feeling today?

315
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,392
Sleep

316
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,851
Sleep, my child

317
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:25,892
- Night falls
- You're singing the same song again.

318
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:31,434
- It's time to sleep
- What is that song?

319
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:35,684
Sleep

320
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:39,517
Sleep, my child

321
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,684
Night falls

322
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:47,059
It's time to sleep

323
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:48,184
Cantika.

324
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:53,226
I need to dwelve further
into your feelings and thoughts.

325
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:58,351
Can you tell me what happened
to you and your family?

326
00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:05,934
Calm down, Cantika.

327
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,851
Cantika, sit down.

328
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:09,434
Calm down.

329
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,267
Please sit back.

330
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:16,226
I need to understand your point of view.

331
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:20,767
So I can know what happened
to you and your family.

332
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,601
Nurse!

333
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:45,642
Nurse!

334
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,601
Nurse!

335
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:57,309
Liv?

336
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,476
You're okay? Are you okay?

337
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,601
I'm okay.

338
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:07,059
Liv.

339
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,226
So, from your last two conversations with Cantika...

340
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:21,517
...she's always triggered
by the mention of her family.

341
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:29,559
I clearly saw her draw a symbol
with her foot on the floor.

342
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:31,059
But I didn't know what the symbol was.

343
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:37,892
Maybe if we find out about the symbol...

344
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:41,184
...we can also find her motive.

345
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:45,267
Get some rest today.

346
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,017
Tomorrow, when Cantika is calmer...

347
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:48,684
...let's talk to her again.

348
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:52,517
Where are you going?

349
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,226
Do you have to smoke all the time?

350
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,392
Don't smoke around here.

351
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,559
I'll put a voice recorder
in Cantika's room and the observation room.

352
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:15,851
Only as a precaution.

353
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:18,184
This is your recording yesterday.

354
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,767
Maybe it can help you analyze things
when you're calmer.

355
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:20,809
A mutilated old lady's dead body was found
in her grandchild's room

356
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,267
A pregnant lady's killer was shot dead

357
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:27,309
Three killers of a student were apprehended

358
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:43,351
Try to analyze her movements

359
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,601
Hello, Cantika.

360
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:37,601
How are you feeling today?

361
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:43,351
You're singing this song again.

362
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,517
May I know what song this is?

363
00:36:53,142 --> 00:36:54,184
Cantika?

364
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:58,851
I need to dwelve further
into your feelings and thoughts.

365
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:04,184
Cantika, calm down.

366
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,434
Cantika, sit down.

367
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:13,934
Can you tell me what happened to you
and your family?

368
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:17,726
So I can know what happened.
Cantika.

369
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:19,267
Calm down.

370
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:22,017
Cantika, sit down.

371
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:24,767
Sleep

372
00:37:25,684 --> 00:37:29,101
Sleep, my child

373
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:33,434
Night falls

374
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:47,976
Sleep

375
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,892
Sleep, my child

376
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:56,934
Night falls

377
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:01,726
It's time to sleep

378
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,142
Sleep

379
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:28,809
Arif?

380
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:38,309
Sleep

381
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:44,142
Sleep, my child

382
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:48,059
- Night falls
- Cantika.

383
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:49,184
Go to sleep.

384
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:53,809
You probably can go home tomorrow.

385
00:38:58,226 --> 00:38:59,851
Help me.

386
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,559
Help me open the door.

387
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,726
What if you rest for now?

388
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:15,642
Okay?

389
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:25,851
Open this door!

390
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,351
Help!

391
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:03,684
Help.

392
00:40:04,684 --> 00:40:06,517
Please, don't hurt me!

393
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:08,517
Help...

394
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:52,476
Hello?

395
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:56,767
What?

396
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:05,642
Oh, okay. I'll be there shortly.

397
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:08,476
Thanks.

398
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:51,559
Help.

399
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:55,684
Help me open the door.

400
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:59,142
What if you rest for now?

401
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,101
Okay?

402
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:17,226
No witness?

403
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:18,392
No.

404
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:29,059
The recording of what happened last night.

405
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:31,684
I also don't understand how...

406
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,809
...but everything that happened
last night was recorded there.

407
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,809
Help me.

408
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,726
- Help me open the door.
- Sorry, the video.

409
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,934
Do you sense that all of this
are connected to Cantika?

410
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:05,892
Jamal, Jane, and then Yuni.

411
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:10,726
Everyone who was physically close to Cantika
suddenly behaved illogical.

412
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:13,976
It's as if they were all in terror.

413
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:15,934
What are you saying?

414
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:18,684
Black magic?

415
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:21,809
What's your conclusion?

416
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,392
You know a mental disorder
won't get into a recording device.

417
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:28,059
Listen.

418
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:32,101
You... You believe in science...

419
00:43:32,934 --> 00:43:36,601
...and coincidences more than satan. Is that so?

420
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:38,976
Okay. Let's say...

421
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:43,142
...everyone who is in close contact with Cantika
will get affected.

422
00:43:44,392 --> 00:43:45,434
Why aren't you affected?

423
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:46,767
Why am I not affected?

424
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:48,267
Maybe...

425
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:51,017
Maybe she wants to play with us.

426
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:52,142
Maybe she...

427
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:53,517
Needs something from us?

428
00:43:56,476 --> 00:43:57,684
I don't know for sure.

429
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:03,476
But I found the symbol you told me.

430
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:10,017
It's on every location of the killings
and suicides that's been happening lately.

431
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:15,476
And every suspect on the cases
killed themselves on location.

432
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,184
So no one could be interrogated.

433
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:20,892
Not one.

434
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:25,976
Slaughtering their loved ones.

435
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:29,309
Cantika did the same.

436
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,559
She killed her loved ones.

437
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:38,184
So what does it have to do with the symbol?

438
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:00,851
What?

439
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:04,601
I think this case is beyond mental disorder.

440
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:07,101
This is out of our hands.

441
00:45:09,726 --> 00:45:10,767
What are you saying?

442
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:18,767
I should've taken her to an ustad or an exorcism
performer so there would be no more victims.

443
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:21,351
Ren...

444
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:22,559
Trust me.

445
00:45:23,142 --> 00:45:25,226
This is pure mental disorder.

446
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:28,184
With someone in Cantika's condition...

447
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,559
...even if you do exorcism on her a thousand times,
they will never be cured.

448
00:45:32,392 --> 00:45:34,809
I can help you solve this case.

449
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:36,267
When can you finish it?

450
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:38,726
Sir.

451
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:39,851
Mr. Rendy.

452
00:45:45,517 --> 00:45:47,476
You were saying about Cantika's case.

453
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,684
It is still in the process of evaluation.

454
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:53,726
Well, but it's been too long, Olivia.

455
00:45:55,392 --> 00:45:58,017
You may hinder the investigation.

456
00:46:01,184 --> 00:46:03,392
And the condition is getting worse.

457
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:05,642
It disturbs a lot of people.

458
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:10,184
So I ask you to solve the case immediately.

459
00:46:12,392 --> 00:46:13,434
I'll do my best, Sir.

460
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:15,434
How are you?

461
00:46:15,684 --> 00:46:17,559
If you need to take a leave of absence,
just do it.

462
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:18,892
I can still handle it.

463
00:46:24,892 --> 00:46:25,934
Excuse me, Mr. Rendy.

464
00:46:33,184 --> 00:46:35,184
I need you to be cooperative.

465
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:41,142
Open it.

466
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:43,059
Just open it.

467
00:46:44,684 --> 00:46:46,226
- Are you sure?
- I am.

468
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:49,351
I want her to be comfortable and open to us.

469
00:47:23,476 --> 00:47:26,059
Do you feel more comfortable, Cantika?

470
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:38,559
How are you feeling?

471
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:45,726
You mean...

472
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,309
...how do I feel after all that happened?

473
00:47:57,476 --> 00:47:58,684
"That happened"?

474
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:01,476
What actually happened?

475
00:48:09,976 --> 00:48:12,392
Just go straight to the point, Doc.

476
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,226
You mean why did I slaughter
my whole family, right?

477
00:48:23,142 --> 00:48:25,684
I'm warning you two.

478
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,851
Stay away from this matter!

479
00:48:29,517 --> 00:48:32,601
You've meddled too much!

480
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:41,059
And you, bastard police...

481
00:48:42,601 --> 00:48:46,226
...sooner or later, I will...

482
00:48:50,976 --> 00:48:52,392
Shoot!

483
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:55,309
Shoot me!

484
00:49:00,267 --> 00:49:02,892
You saw it yourselves, didn't you...

485
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,142
...what I've done to this woman's family?

486
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:12,601
Do you see this?

487
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:16,392
So you did all this consciously?

488
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:28,101
Maybe you're the one who has to explain
what happened in that photo...

489
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:31,017
...Doctor Olivia.

490
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:33,809
What do you mean?

491
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,642
Damn you!

492
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:15,892
You bitch!

493
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:18,267
Liv!

494
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:22,684
Slap! Slap me!

495
00:50:23,017 --> 00:50:25,434
We're the same, Olivia!

496
00:50:28,642 --> 00:50:30,267
Nurse!

497
00:50:31,892 --> 00:50:33,309
Calm down.

498
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:35,351
Calm down.

499
00:50:36,392 --> 00:50:38,351
What's going on with you?

500
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:39,476
Liv?

501
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,976
Liv?

502
00:51:18,184 --> 00:51:19,226
Are you okay?

503
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:22,642
I think we have to go to Cantika's house.

504
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:25,184
Okay.

505
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:26,309
Tomorrow.

506
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:27,559
No, Ren.

507
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:29,017
Today.

508
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:32,892
Are you crazy?

509
00:51:32,976 --> 00:51:34,184
Look at your condition now.

510
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:36,809
Do you realize what just happened?

511
00:51:36,892 --> 00:51:37,934
Yes, I realize.

512
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:40,017
But we have to go to Cantika's house now.

513
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,601
Now?

514
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:46,601
Okay. Put out your cigarette, then.

515
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:07,351
Is this the crime scene?

516
00:52:11,101 --> 00:52:12,642
I can't get my head around it.

517
00:52:13,684 --> 00:52:16,892
How could a mother do all this?

518
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:22,059
That's what we have to find out.

519
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:25,517
Her reason.

520
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:19,767
Her children were still young.

521
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:54,142
Liv.

522
00:53:55,976 --> 00:53:57,017
Come here, Liv.

523
00:54:14,892 --> 00:54:15,934
What?

524
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,184
"Today is your first day opening your eyes,
the jewel of my heart."

525
00:54:35,351 --> 00:54:39,309
"A gift that I never thought would come to me."

526
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:47,851
"As a mother...

527
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:51,434
...there's nothing else I want."

528
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:57,059
"All joy has been born and grow...

529
00:54:58,934 --> 00:55:01,142
...after you came, Lea, my daughter."

530
00:55:01,642 --> 00:55:04,267
"I don't need anything else in this world."

531
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,017
"Thank you for always being there for me."

532
00:55:08,226 --> 00:55:12,517
"To always be there first in all this hardship."

533
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:15,517
"I feel safe to be by your side."

534
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:20,767
"I hope we're together forever, my husband."

535
00:55:27,351 --> 00:55:30,642
Why did she slaughter her whole family?

536
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,892
According to this writing, she loved her family.

537
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:38,809
Are you okay?

538
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:40,601
I'm okay.

539
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:49,642
I...

540
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:51,976
I miss...

541
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,976
Everything will be okay.

542
00:56:30,226 --> 00:56:31,267
Mom.

543
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,851
Mom.

544
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:40,142
I miss you, Mom.

545
00:56:46,642 --> 00:56:47,684
Mom.

546
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:56,684
Mom.

547
00:57:04,809 --> 00:57:05,851
Mom.

548
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:06,892
Mom.

549
00:58:07,434 --> 00:58:10,642
Sing to me for the last time.

550
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:14,767
Marsha, my child

551
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:19,351
My love

552
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:22,017
Don't cry

553
00:58:25,392 --> 00:58:29,684
Because your smile is sweet

554
00:59:07,392 --> 00:59:08,434
Olivia.

555
00:59:11,476 --> 00:59:12,517
Olivia.

556
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:19,976
What's going on with you?

557
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:24,684
Nothing.

558
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:27,184
I'm fine.

559
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:32,684
I'll take my leave.

560
00:59:33,476 --> 00:59:34,517
Sorry.

561
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:37,476
Liv?

562
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,892
Slap me!

563
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:02,434
We're the same, Olivia!

564
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,226
Nurse!

565
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:48,351
Olivia, a specialist doctor, lost her whole family.
The killer is suspected to have a mental disorder.

566
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:58,726
"The killer was found dead, suspected to have..."

567
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,059
Liv?

568
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:33,351
Olivia?

569
01:02:37,851 --> 01:02:39,267
Sorry, Ren. What did you say?

570
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:43,184
Did you get any sleep?

571
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,892
I don't agree to Cantika's transfer.

572
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:51,892
I think she can still be healed.

573
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,101
She has an old wound that still can't be healed.

574
01:02:55,434 --> 01:02:58,976
But there are many people
who had an acute traumatic experience and is healed.

575
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,934
Why are you looking at me that way?

576
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:10,684
What about you?

577
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:13,809
Are you healed?

578
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:18,767
What does it have to do with me?

579
01:03:19,726 --> 01:03:20,851
What happened to you.

580
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:23,767
Losing your husband and your daughter.

581
01:03:25,642 --> 01:03:26,684
Are you healed from that?

582
01:03:27,892 --> 01:03:29,851
Why are you bringing up my past?

583
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:33,142
Did you look me up?

584
01:03:34,267 --> 01:03:35,309
Raka.

585
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:37,351
Raka Raharja.

586
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:41,934
Little brother of your husband, Nico Raharja.

587
01:03:45,226 --> 01:03:46,851
Why did Raka slaughter your family?

588
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:50,517
You know you're out of line here, right?

589
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:51,642
I know.

590
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:55,142
But I think everything's connected.

591
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:00,434
I need to know what actually happened, Liv.

592
01:04:08,684 --> 01:04:09,726
Raka...

593
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:12,142
...my brother-in-law.

594
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:17,184
He never supported my marriage
to his brother, Riko.

595
01:04:18,851 --> 01:04:21,851
He always looked for a way to separate us.

596
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,559
Especially because we were married
because I had gotten pregnant first.

597
01:04:31,184 --> 01:04:35,726
But in time,
he loved Marsha more and hated me more.

598
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,392
He thought that Marsha and Riko needed a woman...

599
01:04:43,184 --> 01:04:46,392
...who had time for her family.

600
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:51,767
A mother who dedicates her life to her family.

601
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:53,434
Not me.

602
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:57,392
Not me, a career woman
who has time only for her patients.

603
01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:07,184
I'm more and more convinced that
all of this has something to do with your case.

604
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:13,642
This is out of our hands.

605
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:18,101
And starting today,
I will transfer Cantika out of your hospital.

606
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:19,601
Listen, Ren.

607
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:22,726
I'm certain Cantika can still be healed.

608
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:23,851
Liv.

609
01:05:24,226 --> 01:05:26,059
All this is the work of the darkness.

610
01:05:26,392 --> 01:05:27,434
But, Ren...

611
01:05:27,517 --> 01:05:30,476
All these killings are beyond logic. All of them.

612
01:05:30,892 --> 01:05:34,517
All the victims are their loved ones.

613
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,226
Do you still think this makes sense?

614
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,684
Okay.

615
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,017
Let's say you're right.

616
01:05:40,226 --> 01:05:43,226
But I have a way to heal Cantika.

617
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:44,601
Liv.

618
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:45,809
Ren!

619
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:49,851
I have a sure-fire way to heal Cantika.

620
01:05:51,101 --> 01:05:52,142
Do you know...

621
01:05:52,767 --> 01:05:56,184
Beautiful memories have the big ability to heal.

622
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:58,559
Beautiful memories.

623
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:04,684
It can be from a photo, a video,
or any item that contains a beautiful memory.

624
01:06:05,101 --> 01:06:06,851
In psychology, there's this term...

625
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:11,851
..."the power healing of beautiful memories
or happy memories".

626
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:15,809
Take me as your example.

627
01:06:16,934 --> 01:06:18,642
I was devastated.

628
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:21,101
I was devastated for years.

629
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:24,642
But I got back up because
I have that beautiful memories.

630
01:06:24,726 --> 01:06:27,017
I have the beautiful memories I keep in here.

631
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:30,309
If not, I'd be in ruins.

632
01:06:38,934 --> 01:06:44,934
I beg you, please,
give me a chance to talk to Cantika.

633
01:06:49,726 --> 01:06:51,559
What do we have to remind her?

634
01:07:23,851 --> 01:07:25,767
I want to have a discussion with you.

635
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:28,601
Whoever you are.

636
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:38,809
Do you still remember
how it feels like to be a mother?

637
01:07:40,392 --> 01:07:42,809
I know you're hurt.

638
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:47,767
Hurt for the loss.

639
01:07:49,684 --> 01:07:50,892
To kiss her forehead.

640
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,601
To kiss her unique aroma.

641
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:06,184
To feel how a little human being
depending her life on you as a mother.

642
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:12,809
But you'll never feel that anymore.

643
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:18,142
Because you betrayed her.

644
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:25,559
I know you feel pain, Cantika.

645
01:08:27,017 --> 01:08:28,642
Pain of loss.

646
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:34,809
I know that feeling, Cantika.

647
01:08:36,101 --> 01:08:37,934
Because I feel that too.

648
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:45,142
Stupid doctor!

649
01:08:46,517 --> 01:08:49,351
Is this your way to heal people?

650
01:08:53,517 --> 01:08:54,559
Cantika.

651
01:08:55,517 --> 01:08:57,142
I'm calling you, Cantika.

652
01:08:57,809 --> 01:09:01,601
Because there's only one Cantika, not her.

653
01:09:07,517 --> 01:09:10,517
I care about you, and I'm sure you know it.

654
01:09:13,976 --> 01:09:15,017
Care?

655
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:21,059
Do you really care about Cantika?

656
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,601
Look.

657
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:27,267
She's wounded because of you.

658
01:09:27,476 --> 01:09:32,684
This wound will never heal,
but you can still carry on with your life!

659
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:36,934
You and me in the end are the same, Olivia!

660
01:09:37,017 --> 01:09:38,726
Don't surrender, Cantika.

661
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:42,017
You're strong because you're a mother.

662
01:09:42,101 --> 01:09:44,601
You have to be much stronger than her!

663
01:09:49,392 --> 01:09:50,809
So, now...

664
01:09:51,976 --> 01:09:54,184
...you believe?

665
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:05,142
Cantika.

666
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:06,642
Cantika.

667
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:08,684
Remember Lea.

668
01:10:11,142 --> 01:10:12,184
Remember Alya.

669
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:19,559
Remember how they were in your womb
for nine months.

670
01:10:20,726 --> 01:10:24,351
Remember your pain for bringing them to the world.

671
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:31,476
You saw them grow up from babies to little kids.

672
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:33,309
Remember that feeling, Cantika.

673
01:10:33,684 --> 01:10:36,101
Remember that feeling, Cantika.

674
01:10:47,642 --> 01:10:48,684
Cantika?

675
01:10:48,934 --> 01:10:49,976
Yes.

676
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:53,392
My children...

677
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:57,142
Cantika, can you hear me?

678
01:10:58,476 --> 01:10:59,892
Look into my eyes, Cantika.

679
01:10:59,976 --> 01:11:01,392
No.

680
01:11:01,476 --> 01:11:03,892
What have I done, Doc?

681
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:06,017
No.

682
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:08,934
Lea...

683
01:11:09,184 --> 01:11:12,392
Look into my eyes. Can you hear me?

684
01:11:14,934 --> 01:11:17,559
My children, Doc.

685
01:11:18,101 --> 01:11:24,476
Lea. Alya.

686
01:11:24,767 --> 01:11:29,184
Cantika, can you hear me?

687
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:34,809
Doc.

688
01:11:36,684 --> 01:11:39,392
Your friend...

689
01:11:43,101 --> 01:11:44,392
I hope you're right, Liv.

690
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:21,809
What do you want?

691
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:23,684
Your friend...

692
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:28,142
Your friend will come with me.

693
01:12:49,476 --> 01:12:50,517
Your...

694
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:11,392
Marsha, my child

695
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:15,059
My love

696
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:18,184
- Stop!
- Don't cry

697
01:13:18,267 --> 01:13:21,684
Don't sing that song. Stop!

698
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:25,559
That's my song! It's not your song! Stop!

699
01:13:26,184 --> 01:13:27,851
Stop!

700
01:13:27,934 --> 01:13:30,517
Marsha, my child

701
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:33,267
My love

702
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:35,892
Don't cry

703
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:38,809
Your smile is sweet

704
01:13:40,476 --> 01:13:42,684
Marsha, my child

705
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:15,726
Who are you?

706
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:17,976
I'm...

707
01:14:19,101 --> 01:14:20,309
...the messenger...

708
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:23,642
...of the devil!

709
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:18,351
Liv?

710
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:24,017
Liv?

711
01:15:34,101 --> 01:15:35,934
- It has come...
- Freeze!

712
01:15:36,976 --> 01:15:38,017
That one has come!

713
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:40,726
It has come. That one has come.

714
01:15:40,809 --> 01:15:43,601
Disaster will come. As I said, right?

715
01:15:43,684 --> 01:15:45,101
Disaster will come!

716
01:15:45,267 --> 01:15:46,684
Disaster will come.

717
01:15:49,642 --> 01:15:51,934
It has come. That one has come.

718
01:15:52,017 --> 01:15:55,434
It has come!

719
01:16:48,142 --> 01:16:49,184
Olivia!

720
01:16:49,559 --> 01:16:50,601
Rendy?

721
01:16:57,226 --> 01:16:58,267
Ren?

722
01:16:59,476 --> 01:17:00,517
It's me.

723
01:17:01,392 --> 01:17:02,434
Rendy.

724
01:17:03,892 --> 01:17:05,101
Don't trust her.

725
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:10,684
Ren, you know me. It's me, Ren.

726
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:12,601
It's me.

727
01:17:13,559 --> 01:17:15,559
- Rendy.
- Don't move!

728
01:17:15,726 --> 01:17:16,934
She's the devil.

729
01:17:18,726 --> 01:17:19,767
Stay where you are.

730
01:17:20,517 --> 01:17:21,934
It's me, Rendy!

731
01:17:28,726 --> 01:17:31,559
The real Olivia will know
what we found in Cantika's house.

732
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:32,851
A book, right?

733
01:17:33,934 --> 01:17:35,059
Her diary.

734
01:17:36,017 --> 01:17:37,059
Am I right?

735
01:17:37,142 --> 01:17:38,184
Rendy!

736
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:41,101
It's me, Olivia!

737
01:17:41,226 --> 01:17:42,642
Trust me, Ren!

738
01:17:44,309 --> 01:17:45,351
Ren.

739
01:17:45,976 --> 01:17:47,809
You know me, Ren.

740
01:17:48,809 --> 01:17:50,434
It's me, Olivia, Ren.

741
01:17:51,726 --> 01:17:53,934
Lower your gun, Ren.

742
01:17:54,392 --> 01:17:55,434
Rendy.

743
01:17:56,517 --> 01:17:58,934
Remember, who she wants is Lea.

744
01:17:59,517 --> 01:18:00,559
Lea.

745
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:02,059
Lea is who she wants.

746
01:18:03,434 --> 01:18:07,726
Ren, it's me, Olivia.

747
01:18:07,809 --> 01:18:09,726
Look at me. Look into my eyes.

748
01:18:09,809 --> 01:18:13,434
It's me, Olivia. Lower your gun, Ren, please.

749
01:18:14,101 --> 01:18:18,934
Ren, it's me, Olivia. Lower your gun, Ren, please.

750
01:18:19,434 --> 01:18:20,476
Ren.

751
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:23,559
Stupid police!

752
01:18:54,309 --> 01:18:55,434
Ren...

753
01:18:55,767 --> 01:18:58,059
Your belly is wounded. You could die.

754
01:18:58,142 --> 01:18:59,559
Let me find you a remedy.

755
01:18:59,642 --> 01:19:01,059
No. Liv.

756
01:19:01,601 --> 01:19:04,351
I have to find a remedy for you! Hang on!

757
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:08,017
You have to know.

758
01:19:10,976 --> 01:19:12,267
About that diary.

759
01:19:12,934 --> 01:19:14,142
What about it?

760
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,642
We didn't finish reading it.

761
01:19:20,559 --> 01:19:22,184
I read it.

762
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:25,351
Cantika wrote in it...

763
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,267
...because slowly...

764
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:37,059
...she started to lose out to her emotions.

765
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:41,059
Each day...

766
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:44,059
...she felt that...

767
01:19:45,684 --> 01:19:47,517
...her consciousness was getting worse.

768
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:52,184
And several times...

769
01:19:55,809 --> 01:19:59,434
...she lost control of herself...

770
01:20:05,226 --> 01:20:07,642
...due to various terrors of hallucinations.

771
01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:15,267
So, she tried to remember
all the sweet memories...

772
01:20:17,851 --> 01:20:20,476
...and kept it in that diary while she could.

773
01:20:25,101 --> 01:20:27,517
The voices started to haunt me.

774
01:20:28,476 --> 01:20:29,892
My sleep is no longer in peace.

775
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:32,142
My life is no longer comfortable.

776
01:20:33,434 --> 01:20:35,517
My emotions are starting to be uncontrollable.

777
01:20:36,434 --> 01:20:40,976
Hunger for violence is starting
to tease me every day.

778
01:20:42,434 --> 01:20:46,142
And in my eyes, the world is no longer the same.

779
01:20:46,559 --> 01:20:49,559
I can no longer differentiate
the reality and the fake one.

780
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:53,976
It all began after I had looked at the symbol.

781
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,767
The symbol that made me...

782
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:14,059
You...

783
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,184
- What is this?
- Keep it.

784
01:21:17,601 --> 01:21:20,017
- What is this?
- Keep it, you'll know.

785
01:21:24,059 --> 01:21:25,184
The symbol...

786
01:21:26,434 --> 01:21:28,642
...represents the devil presence.

787
01:21:39,017 --> 01:21:40,226
We have to go now.

788
01:21:41,559 --> 01:21:43,517
I will divert her attention.

789
01:21:44,726 --> 01:21:46,142
- You run away.
- No.

790
01:21:46,934 --> 01:21:48,351
No.

791
01:21:48,434 --> 01:21:50,184
We can get out of here together.

792
01:21:50,267 --> 01:21:51,684
No.

793
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:53,059
- No.
- Listen.

794
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:55,767
Listen to me.

795
01:21:57,309 --> 01:21:58,726
Liv.

796
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:04,434
You have to end all of this.

797
01:22:08,017 --> 01:22:10,851
We can get out of here together, Ren.

798
01:22:12,851 --> 01:22:14,392
You run.

799
01:22:20,684 --> 01:22:21,726
Come on.

800
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:36,809
Leave, Liv.

801
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,226
Leave!

802
01:22:38,434 --> 01:22:39,476
Go!

803
01:23:48,351 --> 01:23:50,267
Hello, Olivia.

804
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:56,559
I want to have a discussion with you.

805
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:03,226
How are you feeling?

806
01:24:11,726 --> 01:24:13,351
Do you still remember...

807
01:24:14,476 --> 01:24:18,767
...how it feels like to be a mother?

808
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:26,017
To give birth?

809
01:24:29,767 --> 01:24:33,309
To hold her little hands?

810
01:24:36,809 --> 01:24:40,726
To kiss her unique aroma?

811
01:24:46,059 --> 01:24:50,059
Do you still remember Marsha?

812
01:24:53,267 --> 01:24:58,101
Marsha is waiting for you.

813
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:08,017
Marsha, my child

814
01:25:09,476 --> 01:25:12,892
My love

815
01:25:29,101 --> 01:25:31,934
Don't cry

816
01:25:34,851 --> 01:25:37,642
Because your smile is sweet

817
01:26:25,392 --> 01:26:26,434
Liv...

818
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:15,809
I'm Nabila.

819
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:21,017
I'm the doctor who will be with you
while you're here.

820
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:26,767
You don't need to be afraid.

821
01:27:28,226 --> 01:27:29,642
I only want to talk with you.

822
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:34,309
You can tell me anything.

823
01:27:43,517 --> 01:27:46,726
I want to know about your family.

824
01:27:47,892 --> 01:27:48,934
May I?

825
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:54,059
Marsha, my child

826
01:27:55,851 --> 01:27:58,392
My love

827
01:28:02,934 --> 01:28:05,351
Don't cry

828
01:28:07,392 --> 01:28:10,601
Because your smile is sweet

829
01:28:11,642 --> 01:28:15,767
May I know the relationship
between you and your child?

830
01:28:18,267 --> 01:28:20,976
Marsha, my child

831
01:28:22,226 --> 01:28:24,726
My love

832
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,017
Okay, then.

833
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:31,226
Don't cry

834
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:36,642
May I know what you meant to do with this paper?

835
01:28:36,726 --> 01:28:39,059
Sabda Medika Hosital
Room 505

836
01:28:49,017 --> 01:28:50,976
She will come.
