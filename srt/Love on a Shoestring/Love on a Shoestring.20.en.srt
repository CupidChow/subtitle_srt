[Episode 20]

4
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,520
Is this your home?

5
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,260
Yes.

6
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,660
It's perfect for me to live alone.

7
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,000
I think you'd have a hard time living here.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,830
Not at all.

9
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,479
I actually

10
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,800
like it here.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,240
Besides, I only need a place

12
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,090
to sleep.

13
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,229
What are you doing?

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,420
I'm packing up the vegetables that can't be consumed once.

15
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,340
I need to dry off the water

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,420
because too much moisture

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
will make the veggies spoil.

18
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,390
After drying them, putting them in a storage container

19
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,990
will keep them fresh longer.

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,449
So, you're frugal too?

21
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,590
Yes,

22
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,370
because I want to have my own house in Taipei.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,690
It's easier to achieve

24
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,430
that dream together than alone.

25
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,120
You could

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,390
reach your goal faster that way.

27
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,960
I can't do that.

28
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,880
You can't?

29
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,860
I'm not rich or handsome.

30
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,660
If you're with me,

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,210
we'll break up quickly.

32
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,990
So, you've never believed

33
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,430
that I genuinely like you

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,390
because my past targets

35
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,790
were all wealthy men.

36
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,160
I'm thinking

37
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,740
that the woman I love

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,370
should only love me.

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,470
Because

40
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
I will also

41
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,880
love her wholeheartedly.

42
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,470
So, the woman who is with me

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,260
must stay with me for life.

44
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,730
Then I need to live with you even more.

45
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,620
In this way,

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,220
you can see my true feelings.

47
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,440
Should I put it

48
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,710
in this container?

49
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,070
Dry the water off properly.

50
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,450
Are you doing your accounts?

51
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,080
Yes.

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,610
I've been spending more lately,

53
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,470
so I need to record every expense.

54
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,890
Are you happy

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,500
with Haikuo?

56
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,800
Yes, I'm happy.

57
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,070
Why do you ask?

58
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,230
Because you're still adjusting to each other.

59
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,100
I feel like

60
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,890
it's not as easy as you imagined.

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,060
Haikuo

62
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,170
is rich.

63
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,450
It's normal for him to spend money lavishly.

64
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,780
And habits are hard

65
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,700
to change.

66
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,260
It won't happen overnight.

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
It's not just habits.

68
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,950
It's values.

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,990
You've mentioned the issues between him and his dad.

70
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,570
I think deep down,

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,570
he despises money...

72
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,500
Really?

73
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,420
Money is so lovely.

74
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,600
Who would hate it?

75
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,590
Because he associates money

76
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,750
with his dad.

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,020
He resents his dad.

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
Hatred is an emotional issue

79
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,990
and can make a person irrational.

80
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,600
Haikuo is not irrational.

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,120
You're overthinking it.

82
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,250
Today, he would rather

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,110
donate all his money

84
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,460
to stick to his insistence on not leaving a single penny

85
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,370
behind.

86
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,210
That's an obsession.

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,210
Donating money

88
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,430
is charity.

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,160
How is that an obsession?

90
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,870
Besides, he's really trying to change for me.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
My dear.

92
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,510
Can you trust what someone says during the honeymoon phase?

93
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,590
Feelings should

94
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,140
be judged over time.

95
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,450
I think you should pay more attention

96
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,480
to the issues between Haikuo and his dad.

97
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,130
No.

98
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,690
I promised Haikuo

99
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,490
I wouldn't interfere between him and his dad.

100
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,750
I'll only support him.

101
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,190
If you don’t help Haikuo resolve his issues,

102
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,520
just supporting and cooperating with him

103
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,610
won't lead to a good outcome.

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,230
I'm not cooperating.

105
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,770
You're really not cooperating?

106
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,100
Really.

107
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,280
And the issues between Haikuo and his dad

108
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,550
can only be solved by them.

109
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,730
I can’t help anyway.

110
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,220
Really?

111
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,450
Yes.

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,230
Your daughter is so smart.

113
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,800
I won't let myself suffer.

114
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,790
Trust me.

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,380
Alright.

116
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,000
It's getting late.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,250
Hurry up and go to sleep.

118
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,800
-Time to sleep.
-Okay.

119
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,330
Hurry.

120
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,420
Good night.

121
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,380
Good night.

122
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,340
You really asked the right person.

123
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,080
Yes!

124
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,190
When opening a shop,

125
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,180
regardless of the decor and skills,

126
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,710
the most important thing is

127
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,850
location, location, and location.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,100
Location.

129
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,590
The important thing needs to be said three times.

130
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,590
But isn't rent

131
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,260
for a good location very expensive?

132
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,380
You can rent a smaller shop.

133
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,630
Have you recorded it?

134
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,290
Yes.

135
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,850
Like when I opened this shop,

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,650
I thought about it for a long time...

137
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,120
-And did a lot of preparations.
-What are you guys talking about?

138
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,050
Jiali wants to open a shop.

139
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,909
We’re asking Manager for advice.

140
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,690
Are you involved too?

141
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,240
Yes.

142
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,170
Jiali's shop is my shop.

143
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,750
And we’ve already discussed it.

144
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,070
In the future, Jiali will only be responsible for bread and desserts,

145
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,470
and I’ll handle the rest.

146
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,960
Then I wish you success with your shop.

147
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,740
Thank you.

148
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,630
We will definitely succeed.

149
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,510
We might even open a chain in the future

150
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,170
or make it into an international enterprise.

151
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,100
That's great.

152
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,060
Naive people are happy people.

153
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,310
We’ll leave now.

154
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,290
Manager, we won’t delay your work.

155
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,640
Qianqian, bye.

156
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,860
Manager, I've recorded everything.

157
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,430
Okay.

158
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,090
Thank you, Manager.

159
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:24,890
Good luck.

160
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,120
Ask me if you have any questions.

161
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,540
Sure.

162
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,150
Jiali.

163
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,440
Jiali.

164
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,160
Why are you leaving so soon?

165
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,080
We still have a lot of questions

166
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,990
to ask Manager.

167
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,480
Didn't you see?

168
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,690
I feel

169
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,950
she still cares about our relationship.

170
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,470
So, I thought it would be better to leave quickly

171
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,809
and not provoke her.

172
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,440
As you know,

173
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,780
she still likes you.

174
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,060
I don't think so.

175
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,050
You boys are so insensitive.

176
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
You know she’s very capable at work,

177
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,490
but ever since she found out

178
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,120
I like you,

179
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,180
she sometimes gets distracted

180
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,830
or makes small mistakes.

181
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,180
She still cares about you.

182
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,440
Now that we’re together

183
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,350
and the three of us

184
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,720
work in the same place,

185
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,320
we should be

186
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,770
more considerate of her feelings.

187
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,250
Okay, I got it.

188
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,200
I’ll be mindful.

189
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,200
President Wang,

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
thank you so much.

191
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,820
It’s our great honor for Trendee

192
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,950
to collaborate with such a large enterprise like yours.

193
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,640
[Trendee's General Manager, Ma Junwei, fawns to survive]

194
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
This order is just the beginning.

195
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,740
If the cooperation goes well,

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,830
there might be

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,280
more opportunities.

198
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,070
President Wang, don't worry.

199
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,360
We will do our best.

200
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,020
Any instructions from you

201
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,780
will be executed without fail.

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
Before giving the order,

203
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,090
President Wang has another request.

204
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,760
Elly,

205
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,540
what skincare product did you use today?

206
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,870
Your complexion looks great.

207
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,440
Your skin is so good.

208
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,410
You look so much more energized.

209
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,430
I didn't do anything special.

210
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm just staying at Michael Zhao's house.

211
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,250
Do you mean

212
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,370
it's the power of love?

213
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,190
Are you already showing off your relationship?

214
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,270
Neither.

215
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,390
It's because his lifestyle is so healthy

216
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,790
and regular.

217
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,430
This perfume

218
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
is the scent men like the most.

219
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,150
I want Michael Zhao

220
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,350
to remember my scent.

221
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,540
This way,

222
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,640
he'll gradually become attached to me

223
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,300
and won't want to push me away.

224
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,800
What's going on? Is there a power outage?

225
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,800
It's not a power outage.

226
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,750
It's time.

227
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,390
What do you mean?

228
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,680
It's 9:30 p.m.

229
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,550
It's my bedtime.

230
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,030
Early to bed and early to rise is good for your health.

231
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,150
What is this?

232
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,760
This is my favorite vegetarian meal.

233
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,640
I bought it from a supermarket.

234
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,170
Nutritious and delicious.

235
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,320
It's a vegetarian's three meals a day.

236
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,540
I want a cup of coffee.

237
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,780
This is...

238
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,830
Green latte.

239
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,650
It can treat fatty liver

240
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,820
and reduce body fat.

241
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,630
It's good for your health.

242
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,160
It's good.

243
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,190
Because he has such a healthy life,

244
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,750
my skin has become so good

245
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,670
that it looks like I've applied powder.

246
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,270
So having a boyfriend has this kind of benefit?

247
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,580
He's not my boyfriend.

248
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,040
Aren't you guys living together?

249
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,440
Isn't he your boyfriend?

250
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,920
I'm staying at his house

251
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,420
to prove my sincerity.

252
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,590
Don't worry.

253
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,130
I'm confident

254
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,120
that he will soon

255
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,120
believe in me, recognize me,

256
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,810
and then we will be together.

257
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,850
I'll have it with no ice, half sugar, and add bubbles.

258
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,760
Add bubbles?

259
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,440
Thank you.

260
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,470
Ten o'clock is too early.

261
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,030
Let me tell you.

262
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,390
I will win the bet.

263
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,780
Keke and Haikuo will definitely date

264
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,340
for over a year.

265
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,640
Why are you so sure?

266
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,890
Keke just ordered drinks with us.

267
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,520
And

268
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,200
she even asked to add bubbles!

269
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,550
Keke.

270
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,650
Are you crazy?

271
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,380
You even want to add bubbles.

272
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,420
Don't you know

273
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,560
it costs an extra ten NTD?

274
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,240
I think it's okay.

275
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,700
It's just a drink.

276
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,530
Aren't you ordering too?

277
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,810
So you're frugal too?

278
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,530
Yes.

279
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,150
because I want to have my own house in Taipei.

280
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,460
It's easier to achieve

281
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,260
that dream together than alone.

282
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,020
You could

283
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,490
reach your goal faster that way.

284
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,530
Drinks are bad for your health.

285
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,800
It's a waste of money.

286
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,770
I'd better drink water.

287
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,290
It's healthy and thrifty.

288
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,790
I feel like there's

289
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,890
a weird vibe here.

290
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,330
Did you hear that?

291
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,970
Elly said she wants to save money.

292
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,050
Keke said she wants to spend money.

293
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,420
Should you call

294
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,790
your grandma and ask?

295
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,640
Manager.

296
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
I have something to tell you.

297
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,460
What do you want to say?

298
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,390
Well...

299
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,820
Actually...

300
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,560
Wait.

301
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,340
Who is it?

302
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,610
Michael Zhao.

303
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,270
Help!

304
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,900
Help!

305
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,450
Haikuo. Help!

306
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,120
Please take me in.

307
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,680
Please.

308
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,240
Do you think my house is a hotel?

309
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,550
Look.

310
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,800
I can't stand it in just one night.

311
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,490
Look at the wrinkles around my eyes.

312
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,490
Did you see it?

313
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,750
What do you mean?

314
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,310
Let me have some water.

315
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,810
It's Elly.

316
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,170
She's staying at my house now.

317
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,620
I can't stand it anymore.

318
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,910
How about

319
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,670
tell her the truth?

320
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,580
Tell her

321
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,070
that if she sleeps next to you,

322
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,770
you can't sleep.

323
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,430
No.

324
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,230
Then she will know

325
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,730
that I care about her.

326
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,230
Since you care so much about her,

327
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,630
just accept her.

328
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,840
That's even worse.

329
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,630
If I accept her,

330
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
and fall in love with her,

331
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,280
as my love for her grows deeper

332
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,240
and stronger,

333
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,230
in the end,

334
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,460
when she gets bored

335
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,130
and wants to break up with me,

336
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,490
I won't be able to stand it.

337
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,490
I'll be very sad.

338
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,290
You really have a girl's heart.

339
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,089
Haikuo.

340
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,609
Please, I beg you.

341
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,220
Let me stay for one night.

342
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,079
Just one night.

343
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,530
Please.

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,390
Just say yes.

345
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,550
He looks pitiful.

346
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,040
Thank you.

347
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,650
Please.

348
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,080
Since you're so kind,

349
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,830
could you send a message to Elly for me

350
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,690
and tell her I won't be coming back to sleep tonight?

351
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,770
Elly.

352
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
Michael Zhao is sleeping

353
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,530
at my place tonight.

354
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,970
He won't be coming back.

355
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,910
Okay.

356
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,300
That's it?

357
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,350
He must be tired.

358
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,940
He can even sleep like this.

359
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,420
Okay, whatever.

360
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,460
So, what did you want to tell me?

361
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,960
Just the commission

362
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,770
from a multimillion-NTD order

363
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,030
could cover the down payment for a house.

364
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,380
Actually,

365
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,690
it's nothing.

366
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,030
I'll tell you next time.

367
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,790
Isn't that too loud?

368
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,150
If you want Michael Zhao

369
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,510
to never escape your grasp,

370
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,800
you need to play the long game.

371
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,470
That's not right.

372
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,870
True love can't involve these tricks.

373
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,380
You must be sincere.

374
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,640
He doesn't believe in sincerity.

375
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,300
So, of course, you have to change your strategy.

376
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,710
What if it backfires

377
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,410
and pushes Michael Zhao

378
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
further away?

379
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,370
To handle men,

380
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,590
you need to accommodate and cooperate with them,

381
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,050
break down their defenses,

382
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,810
and then

383
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,560
conquer them in one go

384
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,680
so that things cannot be undone.

385
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,970
True love shouldn't be forced.

386
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,970
In the battlefield of love,

387
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,320
we don't need saints or pure-hearted women

388
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,240
but

389
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,540
strategic and cunning women.

390
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,700
That's right.

391
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,030
To get what I want,

392
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,730
using some tactics

393
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,890
is necessary.

394
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,650
It's done.

395
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,330
Thank you.

396
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,680
-It’s done. Thank you.
-Thank you.

397
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,530
Yuanchong.

398
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,730
I see you have a regular schedule next month.

399
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,330
Yes, because the store is short-staffed.

400
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,420
I thought you'd have fewer shifts.

401
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,740
Haven't you been

402
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,770
helping Jiali find a shop recently?

403
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,690
You boys are so insensitive.

404
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,730
You know she’s very capable at work,

405
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,890
but ever since she found out

406
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,510
I like you,

407
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,630
she sometimes gets distracted

408
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,140
or makes small mistakes.

409
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,480
Hasn't that recent product line released

410
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
your favorite pasta?

411
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,970
Really?

412
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,650
Do you want to check it out?

413
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,310
Yuanchong.

414
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,240
My friend has a shop.

415
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,210
Do you and Jiali want to take a look?

416
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,060
Well...

417
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,570
Manager, I'll go restock the drinks.

418
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,080
I just restocked the drinks.

419
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll go restock the bread.

420
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,530
I just restocked the bread.

421
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,570
Why don't you and Jiali want to rent a shop anymore?

422
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,490
We...

423
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,520
Because

424
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,960
we're not opening a shop anymore.

425
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,170
Why not?

426
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,890
Is it because of funding?

427
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,900
No.

428
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,040
We...

429
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,270
We...

430
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,490
Did you guys have a fight?

431
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,420
Did you guys break up?

432
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,950
No.

433
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,320
-We...
-Did you guys break up?

434
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,870
Manager, it's okay.

435
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,730
Just stop.

436
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:13,920
You...

437
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,390
Come with me.

438
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,740
You and Jiali...

439
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,930
Jiali and I

440
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,620
are very stable now.

441
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,940
We won't break up.

442
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,190
That's not what I meant.

443
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,590
I really can't accept you.

444
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,270
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,260
Calm down...

446
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm a man who doesn't deserve to be loved.

447
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,800
I'm not as smart as you,

448
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,700
not as clever,

449
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,050
and not as agile.

450
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:42,890
You...

451
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,420
You deserve a better man.

452
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,830
So, definitely...

453
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,720
Definitely...

454
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,150
Sir.

455
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
Can you calm down?

456
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,830
If not,

457
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,750
I'll have to pour this entire bag of ice on you.

458
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
I'm already calm.

459
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,450
Very calm.

460
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,580
Listen.

461
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,460
I

462
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,060
don't like Li Yuanchong anymore.

463
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,050
So from now on,

464
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,910
you don't have to avoid

465
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,240
talking about you and Jiali in front of me.

466
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,130
But

467
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,800
that day, Jiali said

468
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,590
you didn't look well,

469
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,260
like you were heartbroken.

470
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,790
Heartbroken?

471
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,620
Please, that wasn't heartbreak.

472
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,310
That was foot pain, okay?

473
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,230
I sprained my ankle

474
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,970
hiking a few days ago, okay?

475
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,390
So

476
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,880
you don't like me anymore?

477
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,760
Well. Thinking about it,

478
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,620
you were right.

479
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,380
You're very ordinary

480
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,610
and plain,

481
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,840
so I didn't hold on too tightly.

482
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,300
I was sad for one night,

483
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,800
but I feel much better now.

484
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,820
I don't deserve to be loved.

485
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,690
That's great.

486
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,430
Now we can get along

487
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,870
as well as we did before.

488
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,540
Yes.

489
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,770
The next one

490
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,110
will be better.

491
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,980
That's right.

492
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,910
Tell me.

493
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,030
Why are you

494
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,240
being so mysterious?

495
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,570
No matter how I think about it,

496
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,370
I feel bad for hiding it from you.

497
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,570
But

498
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,140
I really had no choice.

499
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,380
Mr. Fang is my biggest client.

500
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,410
I couldn't do anything about it.

501
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,110
Is there something wrong?

502
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
Is there a problem with Mr. Fang?

503
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,690
Actually,

504
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,010
since your first day at the company,

505
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,940
Mr. Fang has been actively contacting me.

506
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,490
My performance improved

507
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,220
because he kept supporting me.

508
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,070
And he did all this

509
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
because your dad instructed him to.

510
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,590
So?

511
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,430
Actually, your dad has been

512
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,890
monitoring you all along.

513
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,730
I even

514
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,620
took Keke to see your dad

515
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,040
because he wanted to know her.

516
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,370
Keke really cares about you.

517
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,190
She knew you wanted a complete family,

518
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,180
so she agreed

519
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
to help reconcile you with your dad.

520
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,930
I see.

521
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,600
So, it was you.

522
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,470
Will you

523
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,760
never talk to me again?

524
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
It's okay if you think

525
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,180
I don't deserve to be your friend anymore.

526
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,030
I won't be upset.

527
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,960
But don't blame Keke.

528
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,340
She did it all for your sake.

529
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,390
I won't blame you two.

530
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,730
It's not your fault.

531
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,120
If you really want to apologize,

532
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,420
buy me a cup of coffee.

533
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,870
You really don't blame me?

534
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,860
Okay.

535
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,270
I'll go buy it now.

536
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I'll get two cups.

537
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,240
Two cups? We can't drink that much.

538
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,460
No, it's...

539
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,890
One for you and one for me.

540
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,970
Wait for me. I'll go get them now.

541
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,430
Wait for me.

542
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,840
What's up?

543
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,820
Feeling down?

544
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,420
I'm sorry.

545
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,460
Chen Shi told me everything.

546
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,670
I was too emotional and impulsive.

547
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,640
So I lashed out at you without understanding the situation.

548
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,570
It's all in the past.

549
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,690
It's okay.

550
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,060
Besides, you explained it to me.

551
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,460
It's understandable.

552
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,580
Thank you.

553
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,330
No matter what happens in this world,

554
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,110
having your warmth is enough for me.

555
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,150
Does someone need some warmth right now?

556
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,200
I do.

557
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,350
President Wang, please.

558
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,330
President Wang?

559
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,620
Well...

560
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,230
Why is President Wang here?

561
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,880
Manager...

562
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,170
President Wang.

563
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,620
We will inform the result

564
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,840
after our discussion.

565
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,870
[Division One]

566
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,200
I'll send it to your secretary

567
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,530
so you can double check.

568
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,680
The General Manager is looking for you.

569
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,320
Now?

570
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,930
Now.

571
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,050
Okay?

572
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,970
Okay.

573
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,850
No problem.

574
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,840
Let's schedule

575
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,060
another time then.

576
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,890
Is tomorrow okay?

577
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,130
We'll confirm everything tomorrow.

578
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,770
Okay.

579
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,020
He's not here.

580
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,470
Where is Mr. Wang?

581
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,820
The General Manager wanted to see him.

582
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,150
The General Manager...

583
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,630
Oh no.

584
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,670
That's terrible.

585
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,080
Come in.

586
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
General Manager.

587
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,550
Haikuo.

588
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,670
Come in.

589
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,580
Let me tell you.

590
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,870
I secured an extremely

591
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,360
important order today.

592
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,920
I thought long and hard,

593
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,080
and in this entire company,

594
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,570
only you, our top salesperson,

595
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,880
can handle this.

596
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,100
General Manager, please rest assured.

597
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,120
Any task you give me,

598
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,220
I will do my utmost to complete it.

599
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,460
I won't let you down.

600
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,320
Great.

601
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,030
I like your confidence

602
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,980
and your sense of responsibility.

603
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,620
President Wang, you can be at ease now.

604
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,250
Hello, President Wang.

605
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,210
I'm Wang...

606
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,300
This is

607
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,210
the head of the group we're collaborating with,

608
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,720
President Wang Changfa.

609
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,230
General Manager, I'm sorry.

610
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,690
I can't handle this order.

611
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,840
You...

612
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,810
President Wang...

613
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,040
I'm sorry.

614
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,750
What's wrong with you?

615
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,550
You can't just refuse like that.

616
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,170
I just remembered

617
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,120
I have a lot of cases on my plate.

618
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
I don't have the time.

619
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,310
Delegate those cases

620
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,130
to your subordinates.

621
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,420
This order from President Wang is enormous.

622
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,690
It directly impacts next year's company performance.

623
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,620
Weigh the pros and cons carefully.

624
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,290
There are many other excellent salespeople in the company.

625
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,620
It doesn't have to be me.

626
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,110
President Wang specifically requested you.

627
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,990
As a company employee,

628
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,310
for the sake of the company's future,

629
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,230
you can only accept it.

630
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,990
General Manager, I...

631
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,890
Enough.

632
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,300
You know how much

633
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,330
the company would lose

634
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,340
if this order doesn't go through.

635
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,980
Mr. Wang.

636
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,790
I look forward to a pleasant cooperation.

637
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:36,990
It will

638
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,020
definitely be a pleasant cooperation.

639
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,820
It will.

640
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,330
Did the General Manager call

641
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,540
Mr. Wang from Division One?

642
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,010
Is he in there now?

643
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,340
The General Manager did call him, but...

644
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,840
They're meeting an important client right now.

645
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,980
You can't go in.

646
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,120
The important client is President Wang, right?

647
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,870
He's a top salesperson, after all.

648
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,630
It's normal for him to have a bit of a temper.

649
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,760
Please be understanding

650
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,900
and forgive him.

651
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,780
Where is Haikuo?

652
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,550
Why are you here?

653
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,330
We urgently need to talk to Mr. Wang.

654
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,250
Chen Shi,

655
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,690
as Mr. Wang's subordinate,

656
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,290
go back and persuade him.

657
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,560
Tell him not to act on impulse.

658
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,420
He can't push work away like this.

659
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,790
What work?

660
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,300
It doesn't involve the Accounting Department.

661
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,390
President Wang, don't worry.

662
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,060
I will definitely talk to Mr. Wang.

663
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,350
He will accept it.

664
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,360
Please.

665
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,760
Haikuo hasn't picked up.

666
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,790
Where else would he be

667
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,120
other than the General Manager's office?

668
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,530
I was just coming to find you.

669
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,860
What's going on with Haikuo?

670
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,610
We don't know.

671
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,020
We can't find him either.

672
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,040
Yeah.

673
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,090
My cousin told me

674
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,490
Haikuo went to the HR department

675
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,760
to submit his resignation.

676
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,620
What?

677
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,990
Hello,

678
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,310
this is Mr. Li,

679
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,800
the one who went to see the shop on Houde Road.

680
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,630
We've decided

681
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,800
to rent that place.

682
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,290
So

683
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,700
this is how it feels like

684
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,170
to be cherished and loved.

685
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,550
Okay.

686
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,150
Let's meet tomorrow at 1 PM.

687
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,590
Okay.

688
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,130
Okay, thank you.

689
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,640
Done.

690
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,820
What's wrong?

691
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,210
Luckily I met you.

692
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,889
I feel

693
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,460
so happy.

694
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:30,960
Can I?

695
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,960
What?

696
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,790
Can I

697
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,699
kiss you?

698
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:44,600
Yes.

699
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,800
Jiali.

700
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,650
Here.

701
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,290
Yuanchong.

702
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,600
This chicken is delicious.

703
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,210
I marinated it myself.

704
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,370
Try it.

705
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,810
Thank you, Grandma.

706
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,610
Jiali.

707
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,920
Have some meat.

708
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,850
Alright.

709
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,770
I'll clean it up.

710
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,660
Where are you at?

711
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,030
We

712
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,270
decided to go to Houde Road tomorrow.

713
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,080
What?

714
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,150
Going to a hotel?

715
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,110
Grandma, don't you like it?

716
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,090
But Jiali likes it there.

717
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,840
What do you mean Jiali likes it?

718
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,260
You men...

719
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,330
You just started dating,

720
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,920
and you want to take her to the hotel?

721
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,880
Grandma, no.

722
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,790
We haven't done anything.

723
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,310
I saw you two

724
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,230
all over each other,

725
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,090
and now you say nothing happened.

726
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,520
We...

727
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,420
We just...

728
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,570
We just kissed.

729
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,820
That's all.

730
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,680
Nothing else.

731
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,370
Nothing else. Really.

732
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,410
Really?

733
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,150
Yes.

734
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,440
Yes.

735
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,690
Morning sickness?

736
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,740
It's not mine.

737
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,290
-Not mine.
-What did you say?

738
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,950
If it's not yours, whose is it?

739
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,390
You bad boy.

740
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,660
You appear to be a good guy,

741
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,820
-It hurts.
-but you're actually rotten.

742
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,660
Grandma!

743
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,350
It hurts.

744
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,990
Grandma.

745
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,160
You act like you didn't do anything.

746
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,060
You think

747
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,280
-I don't know?
-Grandma, it hurts.

748
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,810
-You lied to me!
-Grandma.

749
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,900
What's wrong?

750
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,340
Why are you hitting Yuanchong?

751
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,140
I'll tell you, this guy is dirty.

752
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,640
I must have been blind

753
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,720
to let you two date.

754
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,920
Grandma, I'm sorry.

755
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
I know I was wrong.

756
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,470
I'll take responsibility for my child.

757
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,000
What are you talking about?

758
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,750
You two

759
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,710
caused a pregnancy,

760
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,000
and you're still hiding it from me?

761
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm not pregnant, Grandma.

762
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,910
Then why were you throwing up in the bathroom?

763
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,980
I was brushing my teeth

764
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,710
and my tongue.

765
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,500
That should be enough.

766
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:07,440
Keke.

767
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,970
Why are you here?

768
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,090
I called your phone.

769
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,740
But it was off all day.

770
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,410
So I thought I'd come to your place and wait for you.

771
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,440
Let's go inside first.

772
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,320
Are you really going to resign?

773
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,390
Yes.

774
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,030
I've already submitted my resignation.

775
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,560
And I've found another job.

776
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,610
Haikuo.

777
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,500
I know what's on your mind.

778
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,140
I understand how you feel.

779
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,410
But isn't quitting

780
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,780
a bit of an overreaction?

781
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,710
I don't want to work under his control.

782
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,620
He uses his power to make me bow down.

783
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,980
I won't give in to his demands.

784
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,090
So you're going to resign?

785
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,830
What if he keeps coming after you?

786
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,690
Will you just keep quitting jobs?

787
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,250
That would be his fault.

788
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,540
There are countless jobs out there.

789
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,470
I don't believe he has influence in every single one.

790
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,660
Even if I have to be a driver, a waiter,

791
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,020
or set up a street stall,

792
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,140
I can do it.

793
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,750
Are you really willing to give up your expertise

794
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,630
just to avoid his control?

795
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,530
Is that necessary?

796
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:39,080
Keke.

797
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,690
You are my family.

798
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,350
Don't worry.

799
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,730
I'll work hard to make money,

800
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,590
and I'll learn how to save.

801
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,550
No matter how hard it gets for me,

802
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,600
I won't let my family suffer.

803
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,100
Do you really consider me family?

804
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,930
Of course.

805
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,680
If you see me as family,

806
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,160
why didn't you discuss

807
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
such an important decision with me?

808
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,620
Even if you consulted me,

809
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,050
I might try to persuade you,

810
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,580
but in the end, I would respect your decision.

811
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,370
Haikuo.

812
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,880
Being family doesn't mean making decisions alone

813
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,080
or just informing me of your decisions.

814
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,210
And you made me worry all day

815
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,940
without being able to find you.

816
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,010
All day.

817
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,470
All day.

818
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,430
[Preview]

819
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,860
How did I get home last night?

820
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,190
How come I don't remember anything?

821
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,790
It took me a lot of effort

822
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,720
to bring you home.

823
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,850
This is my insurance policy from childhood.

824
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,340
This is my bankbook.

825
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,050
I've transferred everything to Keke's name.

826
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,300
I want to propose

827
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,300
to Keke.

828
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,000
Mom.

829
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,220
100,000 NTD is not enough.

830
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,080
Not enough? That's your problem.

831
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,840
I forbid you to see Jiali again.

832
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,810
What's wrong?

833
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,950
I saw someone who looked a lot like my mom.

834
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,710
Jian Keke.

835
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,980
Will you marry me?
