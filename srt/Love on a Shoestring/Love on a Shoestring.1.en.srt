00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,140
How about buying you a cake?

376
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,710
No, I don't really like sweet food.

377
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,930
Mr. Wang, let's friend each other.

378
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,800
If you need me,

379
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,060
I'll be there anytime.

380
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,210
Do you...

381
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,930
want me to do you a favor?

382
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,970
Mr. Wang.

383
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
You...

384
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,120
Sorry. Am I wrong?

385
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,500
No.

386
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,930
You're right.

387
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,460
I do want to ask you for a favor.

388
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,370
When the manager of Division One resigned,

389
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,130
he took all his members away.

390
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm the only one left.

391
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,300
Because I'm an underperforming employee.

392
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,180
Sorry, your name is...

393
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,890
My name is Chen Shi.

394
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,130
Your name fits you.

395
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,790
Good. This is an advantage.

396
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,250
But for business,

397
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,860
it may not be good.

398
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,510
It's okay.

399
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,570
Let's work hard together.

400
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,510
I'm sure we can be the No. 1 in performance.

401
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,100
Okay.

402
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,470
Gentlemen, what would you like?

403
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,460
A large cup of iced Americano, please.

404
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,410
Is that all?

405
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,150
Mr. Wang, are you sure...

406
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,730
No need. You go ahead.

407
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,010
That's 65 NT dollars.

408
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,680
Okay.

409
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,730
Mr. Wang, do you have...

410
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,810
one buck?

411
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,030
Yes.

412
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,820
The guy in blue business suit.

413
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,490
Those who look down on one buck

414
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,110
will cry over it eventually.

415
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,710
Keep it.

416
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,570
Wait.

417
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,240
I'm going to pay with my mobile phone.

418
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,040
Two large cups of iced Americano.

419
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,700
Okay.

420
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,300
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

421
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,250
Are you ready?

422
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,050
Yes.

423
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,490
I'm getting started then.

424
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,770
Okay.

425
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,990
Ready.

426
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,600
Go!

427
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,030
8.4 seconds.

428
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,700
Impressive.

429
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,490
Who am I?

430
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,870
The Queen of saving electricity.

431
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,730
Of course.

432
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,420
Done.

433
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,260
Done?

434
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,000
Beautiful, right?

435
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,000
What is it?

436
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,850
A handmade bag.

437
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,690
It's for my beautiful and lovely daughter.

438
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,650
It's so cute.

439
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,220
You said you want to buy a bag.

440
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,610
You said it a few times.

441
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,190
You didn't find anything you like when you went to the thrift shop.

442
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,930
So today, I used something

443
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,820
to make a knitted bag for you personally.

444
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,980
Amazing.

445
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,800
You know knitted bags are popular this year?

446
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,090
Right? I'm your father.

447
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,040
Also, this color is very special.

448
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,610
Taro purple, right?

449
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,040
So cute.

450
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,100
Beautiful, right?

451
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,880
Thank you.

452
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,590
Now I'm going to buy

453
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,170
your favorite stinky tofu.

454
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
No need for that.

455
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,200
Mom made Stir-fried Beef with Scallions,

456
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
Fried Eggs with Onions,

457
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,590
and soup.

458
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,450
That's enough.

459
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,410
It's different.

460
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,630
You've been working so hard.

461
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,630
Of course I should buy your favorite

462
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,870
stinky tofu.

463
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,730
It's very stinky.

464
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm sure you'll like it.

465
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,960
No need for that, really.

466
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,370
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

467
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,110
Alright, your dad loves you.

468
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,720
Just let him go.

469
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,130
Okay, see you later.

470
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,050
My precious daughter.

471
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,600
Have a seat.

472
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,140
In order to make this bag for you,

473
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,650
your father hasn't slept for a few days.

474
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,440
I don't want him to be so tired.

475
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,620
Because

476
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,460
he thinks he...

477
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,890
feels sorry to you, so...

478
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,630
Stop talking about

479
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,630
feeling sorry.

480
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,490
He didn't do anything wrong to me.

481
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,700
Anyway,

482
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,740
he should take up the responsibilities for his own mistakes.

483
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,070
No matter how hard it is,

484
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,520
he can't implicate his daughter.

485
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,420
He's responsible now.

486
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,280
Just now, his shoes looked so old,

487
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,940
but he didn't even want to buy a new pair of shoes.

488
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,020
It's okay.

489
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,290
Alright.

490
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,830
You're the best.

491
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,070
Look. It's cute.

492
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,370
A promotion?

493
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,640
Is your news corrret?

494
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,740
I'm the HR manager.

495
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,560
Whether it's about promotion, salary increases or dismissal,

496
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,520
they have to inform me.

497
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,940
Am I right?

498
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,500
On what grounds can she get promoted?

499
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,610
She saved some money for the company last year

500
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,430
and helped the Accounting Department improve its KPI a lot.

501
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,530
Besides, this time,

502
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,890
the Vice President of the Marketing & Public Relations Department

503
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,290
highly praised her, too.

504
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,760
Do you think she should be promoted?

505
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,330
Cousin, even you approve of her promotion, too.

506
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,300
Then I have nothing to say.

507
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,930
It's rare to get a promotion and a raise in salary.

508
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,600
As her colleague,

509
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,100
I should give her a gift to congratulate her.

510
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,390
A gift?

511
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,160
What do you want to give her?

512
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,610
Look.

513
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,220
Isn't it amazing?

514
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,500
In order to save money,

515
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,630
now his craftsmanship is really good.

516
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,490
Uncle Jian definitely doesn't hope that

517
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,530
you'll have to save money all the time

518
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,440
and can't buy the things

519
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,210
you like,

520
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,160
because someone cheated him out of his money.

521
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,090
That's why he has been improving his craftsmanship.

522
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,370
So I've decided that

523
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,700
I'll quit saving money.

524
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,630
I want to buy a pair of

525
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,050
better shoes for him.

526
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,400
I'll share the cost with you.

527
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,700
I'll pay half of the cost.

528
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,800
No need.

529
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,730
You just need to attend his birthday party,

530
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,070
and he'll be very happy.

531
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,700
How is it going with your plan of looking for the location for your shop?

532
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,800
Do you have any ideal choices?

533
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,080
Well...

534
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,330
Sun Jiali.

535
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,930
Did you lend him the money again?

536
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,090
No.

537
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,520
No?

538
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,440
You must have lent him the money.

539
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,900
As you know, if it weren't for him,

540
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,490
you would have opened your shop.

541
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,410
When people are in a relationship,

542
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,130
at most, they will just spend a small amount of money.

543
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,990
But you're losing money in it.

544
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,730
You're losing money in it.

545
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,860
-You're losing money...
-Your mobile phone is ringing.

546
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,970
Who is that?

547
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,960
It's Joan from the Marketing & Public Relations Department.

548
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,000
She wants to add me to her friend list.

549
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,330
Then aren't you going to agree?

550
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,340
Of course not.

551
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Your wedding will be held at a five-star hotel?

552
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,870
That must cost a lot.

553
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,240
I've heard that the food in this hotel is very delicious.

554
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,340
I'll definitely attend your wedding.

555
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,660
So everyone, please help me

556
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,230
get the guest list for my wedding

557
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,270
before 5 p.m. today.

558
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,330
In this way, it'll be easier for me to count the number of the guests.

559
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,750
-Okay.
-Okay.

560
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,320
Jian Keke, you're back.

561
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,680
Yes, what's wrong?

562
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,270
Nothing.

563
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,170
Previously, there was a rumor in the company that

564
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,530
you didn't get along well with Joan.

565
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,260
Now Joan is going to get married

566
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,720
I think you'll attend her wedding

567
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,540
so as to squash the rumor, right?

568
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,240
What do you want now?

569
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,600
Joan.

570
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,050
Send the electronic wedding invitation letter to Keke now.

571
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,330
But she didn't add me to her friend list.

572
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,300
She didn't add you to her friend list?

573
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,870
It's okay. She's already here.

574
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,180
Just give it to her directly.

575
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,960
Before I can use the bonus I've earned

576
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,530
to buy a pair of shoes for my father,

577
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,190
I have to give it to Joan as a gift for her wedding?

578
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,740
Jian Keke, where are you going?

579
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
I'm going to work.

580
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,640
Jian Keke.

581
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,850
Why did you run away?

582
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,730
I'm in a hurry to deliver documents.

583
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,120
That evil Elly

584
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,540
even wanted to attack me with a red bomb.

585
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,650
That's strange.

586
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,170
We took the elevator.

587
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,390
I don't think we would be much slower than her.

588
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,250
Where is she?

589
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,230
It'll be time to get off work soon.

590
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,490
But I still asked you to go with me to have a meeting with a client.

591
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,690
Thanks for your hard work.

592
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,020
I'll treat you

593
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,180
to karaoke tonight.

594
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,060
Manager, you've just joined our company,

595
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,160
and you're going to treat us to karaoke so soon?

596
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,530
Manager, you're really generous,

597
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,700
unlike the other two managers,

598
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,800
who are so stingy.

599
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,260
-Right. They are very stingy.
-Very stingy.

600
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,580
I forgot to take my mobile phone.

601
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,650
I'll go upstairs to get my mobile phone.

602
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,780
Wait for me in the lobby first.

603
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,840
I'll be right down.

604
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,200
Okay.

605
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,620
Just hang in there for a while again.

606
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,280
Then the bomb will be defused.

607
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,320
I'm happy.

608
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,580
Hello.

609
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,260
My name is Wang Haikuo.

610
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,080
I'm the manager of the No. 1 Business Department.

611
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,940
Hello.

612
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,110
Elly asked us to find Keke.

613
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,390
Where is Keke?

614
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,400
Let me tell you.

615
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,490
Of course she has to hide herself well.

616
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,420
For Keke, red bombs

617
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,590
are on the same level as nuclear bombs.

618
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,200
We're in the Business Department now.

619
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,860
Let's go inside to take a look.

620
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,390
Maybe she's hiding inside.

621
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,360
Look at that man.

622
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,440
He's handsome.

623
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,010
Right?

624
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,350
Let's go over there to get to know him.

625
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,030
No.

626
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,170
We're here to look for Keke.

627
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,330
It's okay.

628
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,730
I've never seen him before.

629
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,800
He doesn't look like a manufacturer.

630
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,090
Maybe he's a newcomer.

631
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,970
Let's get to know him.

632
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:27,670
Let's go.

633
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,640
Can you do me a favor?

634
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,900
What favor is it?

635
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,470
Put it on.

636
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,770
Put it on now.

637
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,700
Hurry up.

638
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,260
What is he doing?

639
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,460
Is he weak?

640
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,990
Why is he wearing a blanket?

641
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,240
Turn around.

642
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,380
Turn.

643
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,480
Is he playing the role of Superman?

644
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,050
Are people of the Business Department that free?

645
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,680
So he's having a Cosplay?

646
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,030
Is it possible that our company

647
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,030
is holding a stage play event?

648
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,690
Hurry up.

649
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,860
Let's go.

650
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,010
Where are we going?

651
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,200
Anywhere is fine.

652
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,160
Just take me away from here.

653
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,840
Let's go!

654
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,550
Let's go now!

655
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,330
Left, right.

656
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,230
What is he doing?

657
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,190
He's walking

658
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,350
in such a weird way.

659
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,910
He's walking towards us.

660
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,500
Right.

661
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,870
Is he approaching us now?

662
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,900
Where's his face?

663
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,850
Why is he walking like this?

664
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,150
Should we run away?

665
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,770
Will our lives be in danger?

666
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,170
Well...

667
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,240
What should we do?

668
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,840
My feet are weak. I have no strength to walk now.

669
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,540
It's okay.

670
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,530
He's approaching us.

671
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,030
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

672
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,110
He smiled at me.

673
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,490
It's okay.

674
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,890
I'm a little nervous, too.

675
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,680
He left, didn't he?

676
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,890
What a pity for such a handsome man.

677
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
I think

678
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,750
God is fair.

679
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,140
It seems that we have a good tacit understanding.

680
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,160
Not bad.

681
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,650
But thank you.

682
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,300
So you don't recognize me?

683
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,270
Should I recognize you?

684
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,400
But after you mentioned that,

685
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,520
you seem to look a bit familiar to me.

686
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,500
Have I seen you somewhere before?

687
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,670
One buck!

688
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,699
What are you doing?

689
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,470
Katy said that they didn't see Keke

690
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,790
in the Business Department.

691
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,130
Where is she now?

692
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,380
People are so bold nowadays.

693
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,850
How dare they date in the office?

694
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,730
That's right. They are just not worried that when they break up,

695
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,530
they'll feel very embarrassed.

696
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,630
What's wrong? Who sent you a message?

697
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,990
Did they find Keke?

698
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,850
People of the Administration Department also said that they didn't see Keke.

699
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,430
There are only these several departments in our company.

700
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,530
So where is Keke now?

701
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,830
Calm down. We'll find her eventually.

702
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,870
It's safe now.

703
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,450
Thank you for your help.

704
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,290
You're welcome.

705
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,470
Was...

706
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,560
I

707
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,480
too close to you just now,

708
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
which made you feel uncomfortable?

709
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,080
No.

710
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,890
No.

711
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,460
Or did my abrupt question scare you,

712
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,790
which made you unhappy?

713
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,610
No, I'm not unhappy.

714
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,240
Really?

715
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,170
Then why aren't you looking at me

716
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,720
if you're not unhappy?

717
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,910
I looked at you for a long time just now.

718
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,870
You looked at me for a long time indeed.

719
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,340
But I don't want to look less at you at all.

720
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,080
One Buck, well...

721
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,990
I mean, thank you for your help.

722
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,970
I have to get back to work.

723
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,290
Bye.

724
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,520
I don't know your name yet.

725
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,860
Jian Keke.

726
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,690
Nice to meet you, Jian Keke.

727
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,910
That was close.

728
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,130
So you really wasn't forced to attend

729
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,170
Joan's wedding?

730
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,140
It's true.

731
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,420
Come on. Be careful. It's still hot.

732
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,490
Okay.

733
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,990
-This looks so delicious.
-Coming.

734
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,170
Be careful. Come on.

735
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,700
What are you talking about? You look so happy.

736
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,080
Your daughter saved some money again.

737
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,060
Really?

738
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,960
By the way, I opened the mailbox just now,

739
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,220
and there was a wedding invitation letter for Keke inside.

740
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,980
[Jian Keke]

741
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,420
Is it possible that Keke is screaming right now?

742
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,920
Probably.

743
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,880
Jian Keke could never anticipate that

744
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,630
I would put the invitation letter in the mailbox of her home directly.

745
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,430
She even hid herself for so long.

746
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,670
However,

747
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,860
how did she manage to finish the work

748
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,320
while hiding herself?

749
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,720
That's not the point.

750
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,450
Most importantly,

751
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,720
even if Keke might not attend Joan's wedding,

752
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,890
she must give her a red packet this time.

753
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,200
Her wedding will be held at a five-star hotel,

754
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,000
so the red packet you're going to give her

755
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
can't contain a very small amount of money.

756
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,690
How much should it be?

757
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,580
At least 2,000 NT dollars.

758
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,580
2,000 NT dollars?

759
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,370
It's a five-star hotel after all.

760
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,400
It means that I have to give all my bonus

761
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,000
to her directly, doesn't it?

762
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,360
Why did you open the mailbox for no reason?

763
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,940
Well...

764
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,470
Auntie Jian, it's not Uncle Jian's fault.

765
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,000
How about this?

766
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,340
If you're not quite close

767
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,380
to Joan,

768
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,370
in fact, you don't have to attend

769
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,420
the wedding or give her a red packet.

770
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,920
That's not okay!

771
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,560
Her wedding invitation letter has been sent here.

772
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,410
They even work in the same company.

773
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,990
It's rude not to give her a red packet.

774
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,240
I didn't expect that Elly, who is such a crafty woman,

775
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,270
would have a tactic like this.

776
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,850
I even asked that man for help.

777
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,020
I even jumped onto him.

778
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,270
I even walked for so long.

779
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,670
I walked all that long distance in vain.

780
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,800
That man?

781
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,100
You even jumped onto him?

782
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,060
Which man?

783
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,700
What?

784
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,020
Did I say anything just now?

785
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,680
What?

786
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,510
Why do you look so shy?

787
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,040
I...

788
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,990
I don't look shy.

789
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,770
N--No.

790
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,850
Then why are you stuttering?

791
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,270
Well...

792
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
I... I'm going to take a shower first

793
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,920
in order to change my mood.

794
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,590
She didn't answer our questions,

795
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,280
and she even ran away.

796
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,780
I think it's the effect of hormones.

797
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,630
Why didn't I just answer their questions directly?

798
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,030
I even said that I was going to take a shower.

799
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm starving now.

800
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:38,130
[Money-saving Bank—Account Balance: 100,520 NT dollars]

801
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,310
Figures can make people feel calm indeed.

802
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,300
For the money which Elly has made me lose,

803
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,300
I must take it back.

804
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,040
The assistant of the Business Department

805
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,570
sent me photos of them singing

806
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,420
last night.

807
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,960
Let me see the photos.

808
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,820
He's handsome.

809
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,620
But his action seems weird.

810
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,160
Being weird or not is not the point.

811
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,260
Anyway, he's handsome, and that's good.

812
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,490
I've also heard that this new business manager

813
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,000
is a rich bachelor.

814
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,290
He comes from a good family.

815
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,270
He's very rich.

816
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,910
Rich people

817
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,860
are extremely attractive to Elly.

818
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,360
I've heard that the Business Department

819
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,090
held a welcoming party last night.

820
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,410
After that, they went singing to go on having fun.

821
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,810
Do you know how much it cost

822
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,960
in the end last night?

823
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,460
52,000 NT dollars!

824
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,030
He paid all the costs himself.

825
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,760
It's more than my salary.

826
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,410
52,000 NT dollars.

827
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,260
It's half of my monthly salary.

828
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,690
He spent such a large amount of money.

829
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,760
One Buck.

830
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,380
Hello, everyone.

831
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,900
I'm Wang Haikuo, and I've just joined the Business Department of our company.

832
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,860
I specially bought some snacks

833
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
to say hello to all the departments.

834
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,160
From now on, for the accounts of the Business Department,

835
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,930
I wish that you guys from the Accounting Department

836
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:11,940
wouldn't give us a hard time

837
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,200
and would help us more.

838
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,170
No problem.

839
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,160
Hello, my name is Elly.

840
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,090
If you need anything,

841
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,550
you can come to me anytime.

842
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,760
Hello. Thank you.

843
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,170
But I prefer to ask those who I know for help,

844
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,920
as I'm more familiar with them.

845
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,180
You know someone from our Accounting...

846
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,580
Hi, Jian Keke.

847
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,170
Have you forgotten me so soon?

848
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,090
How would I forget you?

849
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,210
In order to celebrate your joining our company,

850
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,140
I'll treat you to lunch.

851
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,100
Really?

852
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,440
Okay. Then...

853
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,050
12 o'clock on the first floor of our company.

854
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:20,890
Okay.

855
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,530
It turns out that you two know each other so well.

856
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,730
How long have you known each other?

857
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,870
How did you get to know each other?

858
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,820
Over ten years.

859
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,830
-Over ten years?
-Over ten years?

860
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,150
Let me teach you to massage an acupoint.

861
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,470
It can help you refresh yourself.

862
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,180
It can also improve your health and reduce fatigue.

863
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,930
When you need to handle the reimbursement for the business costs...

864
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,900
You buy whatever you want,

865
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,000
and you eat whatever you want.

866
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,430
What if you can't pay the salaries?

867
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,960
It's so late now. Let me call a taxi for you.

868
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,040
A few days ago,

869
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,050
the borough warden said that a girl was stalked.

870
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,730
It's not about whether he came to pick you up or not.

871
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,260
The point is that he always made you wait until midnight.

872
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,000
Why are you so nice to Keke?

873
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,360
Because I think that

874
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,820
she is an interesting girl.

875
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,090
Did you miss your appointment with Vice President Zhang

876
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,630
because of the car accident that day?

877
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,600
This matter

878
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,050
is none of your business.
