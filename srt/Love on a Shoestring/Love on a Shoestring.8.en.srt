I'm sorry.

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,810
If people can just say sorry

13
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,490
when they bump into someone,

14
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,580
why do we need police in this society?

15
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,920
You seem fine.

16

I don't think you're hurt.

since you're injured,

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,060
how about I call an ambulance for you?

38

Or should I take you to the nearby hospital?

Don't bother.

The stomach ulcer tastes good.

82
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,410
No.

83
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,490
I mean it's good for stomach

84
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,880
ulcers.

Yes.

Drinking water can't make me feel less hot.

It makes me feel comfortable.

No need.

109

The ice is too cold.

110
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,410
The temperature of your hand is just right.

111
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,480
Are you

112
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,750

You're blushing.

114

116
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,890
I want to

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
use the restroom.

118
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,390
You'll blush when you want to go to the restroom?

119
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,010
Right.

120
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,720
Because I...

121
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm in a hurry.

122

I can help you.

130
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,590
Did I say I wanted anything?

131
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,650
Because we might need to sell these

132
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,880
to other customers.

133
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,670
It might not be proper

134
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,060
for you to pinch each one like this.

135
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,300
Would you like to choose one first before taking it?

136
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
How do I know

137
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,460
your bread is made of quality ingredients

138
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,620
if I don't pinch it?

139
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,990
You don't have to worry.

140
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,250
All the bread in our shop

141
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,540
is made fresh daily,

142
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,620
and the fillings inside are very rich and solid.

143
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,820
You can rest assured.

144
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,090
So, are you saying

145
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,290
I'm nitpicking?

146
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,910
Is this how you do business?

147
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,770
-You’re rude.
-I didn't mean it that way.

148
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,840
Excuse me, sir.

Why did you push my girlfriend?

152
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,420
Can you bully

153
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,180

154
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,090
Zhigang.

155
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,380
I can handle it myself.

156
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,420
Do people who work part-time

157
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,860
bring their bodyguards nowadays?

158
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,300
No wonder you're so arrogant.

159
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,390
What are you talking about?

160
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,730
-You’ve never been beaten, right?
-What do you want?

161
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,950
-You've never been beaten, right?
-Enough.

162
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,110
Stop fighting.

163
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,600
You're being ridiculous.

164
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,700
Jiali.

165
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,280
Are you alright?

166
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,290
How dare you hit her!

167
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,260
-So what?
-Enough.

168
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,760
-I’ll get even with you.
-Enough.

169
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
-Zhigang.
-Unbelievable.

170
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,190
-Enough.
-I’ll get even with you today.

171
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,450
Enough.

172
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,350
Calm down.

173
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm the Manager here.

175
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,460
Let me handle this,

176
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,630
okay?

177
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,650
You'll handle it?

178
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,530
I'm not buying anything anymore.

179
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,090
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

180
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,350
Please come again.

181
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,740
The conflict today

182
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,670
is really upsetting.

183
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,830
I'm really sorry.

184
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,650
I told you last time

185
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,040
if something similar happened again,

186
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,860
I could only ask you to leave.

187
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,230
Manager.

188
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,280
Please don't fire me.

189
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,560
I really need to stay here to learn.

190
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,880
You know

191
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,070
my dream is to run my own bakery.

192
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,350
I know.

193
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,880
But I already gave you a chance last time.

194
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm really sorry.

195
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,640
I promise it won't happen again.

196
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,840
I have no choice.

197
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,870
Every shop has its own rules.

198
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,590
I have to set an example for other employees.

199
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,580
If everyone caused trouble like you

200
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,310
and begged

201
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,500
for mercy,

202
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,170
how would this shop run?

203
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,070
You should go.

204
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,620
Jiali.

205
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,300
Jiali!

206
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,340
You know

207
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,110
I saw you being bullied just now,

208
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,930
so I stepped in

209
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,280
to protect...

210
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
We've broken up.

211
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,270
I don't need your protection.

212
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,730
And I can handle it myself.

213
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,590
Jiali.

214
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,920
I really don't want to break up.

215
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,470
These days without you by my side,

216
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,410
I really...

217
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,760
I really need you.

218
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,450
Can you come back to me?

219
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,020
We're really over.

220
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,820
Jiali. Jiali.

221
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,820
What exactly do you want?

222
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,130
You hit your hand just now.

223
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,170
I went to buy some medicine.

224
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,430
Remember to apply it.

225
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,100
Yufen.

226
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,350
I need to use the restroom.

227
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,740
Can you answer the incoming calls for me?

228
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,300
Go ahead.

229
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
Thank you.

230
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,220
Are you hot?

231
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,250
You're blushing.

232
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,420
Because I...

233
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,820
I...

234
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,700
I need to

235
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,730
use the restroom.

236
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,630
That's my bedroom.

237
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,660
Why would I mistake Haikuo's bedroom

238
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,180
for the restroom?

239
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,520
Why am I thinking about this?

240
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,300
This drink

241
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,480
is so cold.

242
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,050
There are so many ice cubes.

243
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,300
It makes me feel comfortable.

244
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,530
The ice cubes are too cold.

245
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,280
Your hand's temperature is just right.

246
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,560
What am I even thinking?

247
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,820
Jian Keke.

248
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,490
Jian Keke.

249
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,830
Jian Keke.

250
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,740
Why are you getting so close to me?

251
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,490
I've been calling you for a while, and you're ignoring me.

252
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,490
I... I'm thinking about something.

253
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,510
What are you thinking about?

254
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,150
I'm thinking about discounted items.

255
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,920
You know I love saving money.

256
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,300
Really?

257
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,210
One moment you're lost in thought,

258
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,950
the next you're sighing.

259
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,450
What's wrong?

260
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,590
I've organized these receipts

261
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,550
for you to check.

262
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,050
Thank you.

263
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,070
Something doesn't feel right.

264
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,380
My intuition tells me

265
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,230
Keke must have a problem.

266
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,720
What's the problem?

267
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,180
She's too cold to Haikuo.

268
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,350
That's because she doesn't love Haikuo.

269
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,180
But when Haikuo was taken away in the ambulance,

270
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,690
she was the first one to rush over

271
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,140
and seemed very anxious.

272
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,560
It was me.

273
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,180
I was the first one to rush over.

274
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,690
And I helped lift him onto the stretcher

275
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,160
with the paramedics.

276
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,140
My point is,

277
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,020
if Keke was so worried about Haikuo,

278
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,630
but now that he's not at work,

279
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,560
she doesn't seem concerned at all.

280
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,100
But when she's at work, she's not focused,

281
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,250
and her emotions fluctuate greatly.

282
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,540
Her expressions are as varied as...

283
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,610
As what?

284
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,200
As someone deeply in love.

285
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,010
Keke is in love?

286
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,290
Keke has finally fallen for me.

287
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,520
But I didn't even know.

288
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,380
But I don't blame her.

289
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,360
Because when Haikuo isn't around,

290
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,460
Keke can't show her love

291
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,390
for me properly.

292
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,910
What are you talking about?

293
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,550
When Haikuo was around,

294
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,330
Keke would occasionally show me kindness,

295
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,390
like giving me a cup of coffee.

296
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,580
But now that Haikuo is absent,

297
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,110
Keke's love

298
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,450
and special treatment towards me

299
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,650
have disappeared.

300
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,860
Little fool.

301
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,339
Keke is so naive.

302
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,329
She is easily getting shy.

303
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,740
Can you stop being so narcissistic?

304
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,690
What's wrong with being narcissistic?

305
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,550
Think about it.

306
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,890
In this world,

307
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,790
if you don't love yourself,

308
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,780
then nobody will love you.

309
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,720
I've decided to track Keke

310
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
after work today.

311
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,180
Why?

312
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,750
Because she'll definitely

313
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,280
contact Haikuo privately.

314
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,720
So we can find out

315
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,120
where Haikuo is staying.

316
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,880
That's right.

317
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,760
Geat.

318
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,330
I can finally know where Haikuo is.

319
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,260
Cheers.

320
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,110
Cheers.

321
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,940
Do you want to take on more shifts?

322
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,870
I will stop working at the bakery.

323
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,630
I can work on weekdays now.

324
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,130
Please help me.

325
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,770
That would be great. I need more hands.

326
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,570
And there's one more thing.

327
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,890
Can I trouble you?

328
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,810
What's the matter?

329
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,010
Can you try not to

330
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,490
schedule me and Yuanchong

331
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,300
to work at the same time?

332
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,600
Is it because Yuanchong is hard to deal with

333
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
or did he hit a nerve with your taboo?

334
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,930
It's my own issue.

335
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,300
Yuanchong is usually distant from people.

336
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,920
Everyone doesn't want to

337
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
work with him now.

338
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,390
And now you too.

339
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,110
It's really not about him.

340
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,660
He works very diligently.

341
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,360
I'm not blaming you.

342
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,990
I just think Yuanchong's luck

343
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,920
has been particularly bad lately.

344
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,410
What happened?

345
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,900
A while ago, he had a dispute

346
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,090
with a customer.

347
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,380
He was too straightforward in speaking.

348
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,780
The customer got so angry, they called the police.

349
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,670
That serious?

350
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,860
-Luckily, I was...
-I was wondering...

351
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,140
if you quit just to avoid

352
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,510
compensating me deliberately.

353
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,010
Now that I've found you,

354
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,630
you better compensate me.

355
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,500
It's ridiculous that treating a minor injury costs ten thousand NTD.

356
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,700
I asked you to show me the medical certificate,

357
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,670
yet you didn't.

358
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,710
How do you expect me to compensate you?

359
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,460
You're really blind.

360
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,340
My hand was dislocated.

361
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,840
What certificate do I need

362
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,170
since it's already wrapped up like this?

363
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,270
Stop babbling.

364
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,320
Just compensate me.

365
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,650
-Okay, okay, calm down.
-Don't...

366
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,410
Don't get physical.

367
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,110
Well.

368
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,730
It's useless to talk to him nicely.

369
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,790
Tell him to pay the medical expenses.

370
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,480
Guang?

371
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,680
You've mistaken me for someone else.

372
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,120
We're not done yet. Where are you going?

373
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,610
What are you doing? Let go!

374
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,940
Why are you here?

375
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,530
Are you here to pick a fight with Yuanchong?

376
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,820
What are you talking about?

377
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,200
I don't know him.

378
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,160
He bumped

379
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,070
into me

380
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,440
and hurt me.

381
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,700
I even saw your post yesterday

382
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,030
saying you went swimming.

383
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,430
Your hand seemed fine.

384
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,240
Why is your hand injured today?

385
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,150
Well...

386
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,170
That is...

387
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,160
This...

388
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,640
Zhigang asked you to come, right?

389
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,320
No, no.

390
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,020
It's okay.

391
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,780
It's okay if you don't tell me.

392
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,530
I'll call him now.

393
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,530
No need to call me.

394
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,370
I just wanted to pick a fight with this guy.

395
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,230
How about that?

396
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,240
You've already cost me

397
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,570
my job at the bakery.

398
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,740
Now you even want me to lose my job

399
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,200
at the convenience store?

400
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,730
You lost your job at the bakery?

401
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,080
Yes.

402
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,010
It was all because of you.

403
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,820
It was because you, an irrelevant person,

404
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,900
kept pestering Jiali,

405
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
like a fly that can't be shooed away.

406
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,440
I'm not an irrelevant person.

407
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,810
I like Jiali.

408
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,350
I don't like anyone.

409
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
Listen.

410
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,210
We won't get back together.

411
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,410
Can you stop bothering me?

412
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,220
Okay, Jiali.

413
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,290
I know you're angry.

414
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,080
I can leave now.

415
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,720
But let me tell you,

416
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,490
I will never give up.

417
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,510
Zhigang.

418
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,210
Wait for me!

419
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,080
You'd better remember it.

420
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,060
Zhigang.

421
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,340
Sorry for the trouble.

422
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,000
Yuanchong.

423
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,850
You have work to do. Where are you going?

424
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,150
I'll take her home. I'll be right back.

425
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,130
He really likes her?

426
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,230
When did it happen?

427
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,820
Why didn't I know?

428
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,620
Jiali.

429
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,640
Let me take you home.

430
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,930
Don't be sad.

431
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,550
This scumbag is not worth it.

432
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,920
It was because you, an irrelevant person,

433
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
kept pestering Jiali.

434
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,790
like a fly that can't be shooed away.

435
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,320
I'm not an irrelevant person.

436
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,530
I like Jiali.

437
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,200
I can't get Yuanchong involved anymore.

438
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,970
Go back to work.

439
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,920
No need for you to escort.

440
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,300
You need it.

441
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,600
What your ex said just now...

442
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,140
I don't think he was joking.

443
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,170
It's none of your business.

444
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,590
Just like he said,

445
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,890
you're not involved.

446
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,320
I'm still going to take you back.

447
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,650
Didn't you hear what I just said?

448
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,000
I did hear you.

449
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,290
Although I'm not involved,

450
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm still going to

451
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,470
get the shoes.

452
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,680
What?

453
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,540
I want to buy this bag.

454
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,370
Isn't this purple one really nice?

455
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,620
I think the blue one is better.

456
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,460
Elly, what do you think?

457
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,720
Look.

458
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,730
I think it's strange.

459
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,740
Strange?

460
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,480
I think it looks good.

461
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,020
It's alright.

462
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,950
I'm not talking about the bag.

463
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,220
I'm talking about Keke.

464
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,900
Keke?

465
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,420
Keke is totally normal.

466
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,580
Keke will definitely

467
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,580
get off work on time today.

468
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,390
It's almost the end of the month.

469
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,990
Keke usually works overtime around this time.

470
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,800
No.

471
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,890
Keke absolutely won't work overtime today.

472
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,560
Even if there's last-minute work,

473
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,460
she'll postpone it until tomorrow.

474
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,480
Impossible.

475
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,690
Keke

476
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,460
never leaves before finishing work.

477
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,440
Well,

478
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,760
let's wait and see.

479
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,620
Five.

480
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,720
Four.

481
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,090
Three.

482
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,060
Two.

483
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,470
One.

484
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,480
Action.

485
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,230
Keke.

486
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,110
I'll do it for you tomorrow.

487
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,640
I have to leave early today.

488
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:55,960
Bye.

489
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,330
She really left.

490
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,900
Unbelievable.

491
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,400
It's hard to believe, right?

492
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,090
I'll go find the answer for you.

493
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,240
The target has left the office.

494
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,920
Over.

495
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,130
Hello, Chen Shi.

496
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,590
I'm off work now.

497
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,320
Do you need me to buy you dinner?

498
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,530
No.

499
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,990
Jian Keke will cook for me.

500
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,590
Jian Keke from the Accounting Department?

501
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,370
Is there another Jian Keke

502
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,170
in the Business Department?

503
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,360
Did you win her over?

504
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,800
Not yet.

505
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm working on it.

506
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Then why would she cook...

507
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,620
I've got another call.

508
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,160
Hello.

509
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,050
I'm at the supermarket.

510
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,580
What do you want for dinner?

511
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,150
Anything is fine.

512
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,170
Pork or beef?

513
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,750
Whatever.

514
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,750
Are you allergic to shrimp?

515
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,760
No.

516
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,490
Are you working?

517
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,760
Am I interrupting you?

518
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,830
I'm a bit busy.

519
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,030
Sorry.

520
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,640
I'll buy the stuff and come right back. Bye.

521
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,210
Hello?

522
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,630
Sorry to keep you waiting.

523
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,150
It sounds like you're smiling.

524
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,730
Did Keke call you?

525
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,340
She asked me what I wanted for dinner

526
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,800
and offered to cook for me.

527
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,050
I suddenly feel a bit sorry for Keke.

528
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,600
Why?

529
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,720
If she becomes my girlfriend,

530
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,520
I will make her happy.

531
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,330
When are you going to start work?

532
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,700
After Jian Keke moves out of my house.

533
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,550
Move out?

534
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,420
You are living together?

535
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,510
Hello?

536
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,920
He hung up on me.

537
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
What did you just say?

538
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,390
Keke is living with whom?

539
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,220
Please

540
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,760
keep this secret for me.

541
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,370
Who asks people for favors

542
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,300
while standing so high and mighty?

543
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,090
Is this low enough?

544
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,000
Please.

545
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,830
Otherwise, I'm really screwed.

546
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,310
I'll think about it.

547
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,860
-Lower.
-Please.

548
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,850
Lower.

549
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,930
Is this low enough?

550
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,540
Please.

551
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,210
Toilet paper.

552
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,850
Paper towel.

553
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,950
Vegetables.

554
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,950
It's too homely.

555
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,790
Is she really going to her boyfriend's house?

556
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,790
This tastes good.

557
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,400
Yes.

558
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,070
-It's called Four Seasons Flowers
-What is this?

559
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,330
The one with the largest quantity.

560
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,520
I thought it was longan honey.

561
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,720
Longans are here.

562
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,050
Longans are only available in March and April.

563
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,120
-How much is this?
-What are you doing?

564
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,130
Keke is behind us.

565
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,190
I'm buying this honey for Haikuo.

566
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,960
This soothes the throat and lungs.

567
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,450
-It's good for his health.
-If Keke sees us,

568
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,380
we can't go to Haikuo's house then.

569
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
I know.

570
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,840
Didn't you notice I'm standing with my back to her?

571
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,240
There's always a chance.

572
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,550
Don't drink it for now.

573
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,480
Thank you.

574
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,620
-Let's go.
-Buy two and get one free.

575
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,180
-Let's go.
-It's a good deal.

576
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,430
I'll be back later.

577
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,060
Let's go.

578
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,990
The beef here is so cheap.

579
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,180
Forget about the beef.

580
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,350
We're doomed if Keke finds out.

581
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,830
These contact lenses are too dry.

582
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,290
What are you doing?

583
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,720
Get up.

584
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,900
You are heavy.

585
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,740
-Lower your voice.
-Get up.

586
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,040
What's that sound?

587
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,360
Breaking news!

588
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,050
Chen Shi said

589
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,260
Keke is now living in Haikuo's house.

590
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,110
I knew it.

591
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,290
A man and a woman living together...

592
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,090
I won't let you two have your way.

593
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,630
Get up!

594
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,950
You're really heavy.

595
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,650
Help me up!

596
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,480
Zhigang

597
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,190
is really bad.

598
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,100
He got you fired.

599
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,690
Alright, don't be angry.

600
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,820
I'll find a new job soon.

601
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,410
It's okay.

602
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,680
Take your time.

603
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,810
Don't worry.

604
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,460
Didn't you tell me you'd be right back?

605
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,600
Yuanchong.

606
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,700
Do you want to stay

607
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,200
and have dinner with us?

608
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,710
Sure.

609
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,300
Don't you need to go back to work?

610
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,390
You're not off work?

611
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,600
No.

612
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,700
Then you'd better go back.

613
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,490
You'll have a lot of chances

614
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,530
to work with Jiali in the future.

615
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,820
Are you short of money?

616
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,280
If not, work fewer shifts.

617
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,900
Because Jiali doesn't want to work with you.

618
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,820
I'm not short of money.

619
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,280
Even if you're not short of money

620
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,670
you should go to work when you need to.

621
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,230
Young people need to be responsible.

622
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,400
We can't give up halfway.

623
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,660
That's not good.

624
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,160
All right.

625
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,390
Go back now.

626
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,800
Don't delay your work.

627
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,330
It makes it hard for others.

628
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,930
Go back now.

629
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,350
Jiali.

630
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,150
Stop looking.

631
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,840
There will be many opportunities in the future.

632
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,870
Didn't Jiali just say?

633
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,290
The manager agreed to

634
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,250
schedule her for more shifts.

635
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,310
The manager told me.

636
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,150
I'm not short of money.

637
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,820
You just do your job well.

638
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,010
But

639
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,420
I'm afraid I might not see you much in the future.

640
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,130
This kid

641
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,420
is really loyal and righteous.

642
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,790
He seems reluctant to leave.

643
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,020
So cute.

644
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,230
You didn't change your shoes.

645
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
You're still wearing our slippers.

646
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,450
Hit him!

647
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,170
Hurry!

648
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,140
Get him! Get him!

649
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,590
Back off!

650
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,130
Why are you so angry?

651
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,780
I'm upset.

652
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,580
How about

653
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,500
we go to karaoke tonight?

654
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Do you have money?

655
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,350
Of course

656
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,040
not.

657
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,740
Don't you have many girlfriends?

658
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,170
Just find one to pay for it.

659
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,990
I've broken up with the others.

660
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,920
Now I only want to be with Jiali.

661
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,170
Are you serious?

662
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,220
I won't let Jiali leave me easily.

663
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,800
Actually, you don't have to

664
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,949
wait here.

665
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,310
When dinner's ready,

666
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,110
I'll call you.

667
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,760
You went to buy groceries for me after work.

668
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,889
Now you're helping me prepare dinner.

669
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,699
How could I just sit there and wait?

670
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,850
I want to help too.

671
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,880
You've already helped me a lot just now.

672
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,210
It was nothing.

673
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,710
This water isn't cold enough; I'll get some ice.

674
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,570
Keep flushing.

675
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,260
Will this be too cold?

676
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,920
Or should I wrap it with gauze?

677
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,560
No need.

678
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,010
You...

679
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,190
Why are you looking at me?

680
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,110
Because you're looking at me.

681
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,750
I'm sorry.

682
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,690
Do you need to use the restroom?

683
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,810
No.

684
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,560
Then why are you blushing?

685
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,270
I...

686
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,600
That's because

687
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,830
the kitchen is hot.

688
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,990
It's so hot.

689
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,610
So your face is red

690
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,020
because the kitchen is too hot,

691
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,840
not because you need to go to the restroom.

692
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,490
Yes, because the kitchen is too hot.

693
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,550
Or is it because you've fallen for me?

694
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,260
Someone's here. I'll get the door.

695
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,860
No, this is your house.

696
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,920
You go get the door.

697
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,300
Haikuo.

698
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,930
Are you okay?

699
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,340
You're fine.

700
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,670
Keke.

701
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,740
Why are you here?

702
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,790
I'm Haikuo's colleague.

703
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,350
I'm here to take care of him.

704
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,130
Then why didn't you call me?

705
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,450
I love getting along with colleagues.

706
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,360
I never thought

707
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,090
my palm strike was so powerful.

708
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,430
I shouldn't have done this that day.

709
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,220
No.

710
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,350
I should use this hand.

711
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,390
I ended up causing you so much pain.

712
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm sorry.

713
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,350
I fainted because of my bad stomach,

714
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,010
not because of your strength.

715
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,470
Look.

716
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,360
Look.

717
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,790
Why is he so nice?

718
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,290
Despite being so seriously injured,

719
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,510
he insists he's fine.

720
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,040
Such a nice person.

721
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,170
You two,

722
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,860
why are you at my house?

723
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,530
Rumor has it that you two are cohabiting.

724
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,450
I came to check in person.

725
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,450
We are not living together.

726
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,100
I'm just staying here temporarily.

727
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,920
Once he gets better and goes back to work,

728
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,720
I'll leave.

729
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,210
In that case,

730
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,640
why don't you count me in?

731
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,140
Taking care of him alone will be more tiring.

732
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,090
We can share the burden together.

733
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,450
Me as well.

734
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,680
I want to make amends.

735
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,640
Count me in.

736
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,810
Count me in.

737
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,090
Someone as warm as you

738
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,850
should find someone who truly treats you right.

739
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,460
You should know

740
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,890
true happiness is waiting for you.

741
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,530
The manager told me.

742
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,410
I'm not short of money.

743
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,020
You just do your job well.

744
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,050
But

745
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,220
I'm afraid I might not see you much in the future.

746
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,290
Yuanchong.

747
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,730
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,430
I really don't know how to face you.

749
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,550
If we just stay friends,

750
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,140
can I

751
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,710
continue working with you?

752
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,260
Is there really no hope

753
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,510
for me and Jiali?

754
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,130
Your cooking skills are at the level

755
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,860
of a five-star hotel head chef.

756
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,670
You wouldn't guess,

757
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,690
but I have a Class B chef's license.

758
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,870
Besides,

759
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,720
I ranked sixth

760
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,670
in an all-Asia

761
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,990
home tidiness contest.

762
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,790
Cooking is my hobby.

763
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,600
I like to cook for myself at home.

764
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,710
Because it's cleaner.

765
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,170
Eating out is unsanitary.

766
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,060
You're just like me.

767
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,590
I also like cooking at home.

768
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,100
Besides being cleaner,

769
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,670
it's also more economical.

770
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,860
I didn't expect we'd be so similar.

771
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,160
Maybe next time we can cook together.

772
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,710
Really?

773
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,790
-Of course.
-Great.

774
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,850
How much money can you save with this?

775
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,700
Making money is what matters.

776
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:09,940
Yes.

777
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,670
Haikuo is right.

778
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,920
Because

779
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,430
I don't earn as much as Haikuo.

780
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,240
My sales performance is not as good as his.

781
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,190
That's why Haikuo is

782
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,500
the manliest of men.

783
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,340
Please applaud if you agree.

784
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,620
Eat while it's hot.

785
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,910
These ingredients are all high-quality.

786
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,700
Very delicious.

787
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,100
Come on everyone. Dig in.

788
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,880
Haikuo.

789
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,330
There's only

790
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,020
one room here.

791
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,890
Are you and Keke

792
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,420
sharing a bed?

793
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,890
No.

794
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,720
I brought a sleeping bag.

795
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,280
I sleep in the living room.

796
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,960
But

797
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,970
I didn't bring a sleeping bag.

798
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,020
So?

799
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,100
After we finish eating,

800
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,820
please go home. Thank you.

801
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,580
Everyone, please quiet down for me.

802
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,620
Please be quiet.

803
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,120
Hello, Mom.

804
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,190
I'm still at the office.

805
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,510
Your dad says

806
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,270
he misses you.

807
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:45,690
Keke.

808
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,300
Are you doing well?

809
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,730
Did you have dinner?

810
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,190
Yes, I did.

811
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,920
There's lots of delicious food near the company.

812
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,760
Don't worry...

813
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,890
Why do I hear a man's voice?

814
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,790
Are you really at the company?

815
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,560
Well...

816
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,090
There are other male colleagues in the office.

817
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:13,970
Is that so?

818
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,720
Yes.

819
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,430
Turn on the video.

820
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,160
I'm telling you. Turn it on now.

821
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,650
You want to video call?

822
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,360
I can't.

823
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,080
No.

824
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,520
I'm busy now.

825
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,590
And there are other colleagues here.

826
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,050
It's not just me.

827
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,860
You'd be disturbing them.

828
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,080
You can sleep in the living room with Keke.

829
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,390
Jian Keke, why are you still on the phone?

830
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,830
The work isn't finished yet.

831
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,310
Don't slack off.

832
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,420
Mom, my colleague is calling me.

833
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,350
I'll go back after I finish work.

834
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,090
Don't worry.

835
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,020
Put more strength into it.

836
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,930
[Preview]

837
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,660
Did you sleep well?

838
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:51,990
With you holding me,

839
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,280
of course I did.

840
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,760
Jiali took a sudden leave.

841
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,800
Please let me go.

842
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,320
How many times have I told you?

843
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,860
I don't want to break up.

844
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,220
I need to talk to you.

845
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,970
It's about Haikuo's family.

846
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,060
How would I know?

847
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,610
I think tonight

848
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,490
we can do some hand care together.

849
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,010
You keep avoiding my gaze.

850
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,470
Is it because...

851
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,770
What happened to me just now?

852
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,170
Why would I have feelings for him?
