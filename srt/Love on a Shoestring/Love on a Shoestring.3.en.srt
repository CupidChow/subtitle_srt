This dried turnip is delicious.

5
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,870
My mom made this.

6
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,330
Your mom made it?

7
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,070
Yes.

8
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,640
Mr. Zhang, listen.

9
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:37,630
Nowadays, we can

10
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,289
buy any kind of food outside.

11
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,140
But only the food made by our mothers

12
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,080
is irreplaceable.

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,890
Also, we'll miss it after eating it.

14
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,890
So I believe your fermented bean curd

15
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,330
should be what everyone misses.

16
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,030
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so popular

Fermented bean curd?

21
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,700
Maybe they can create a new flavor.

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,320
Maybe.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,090

There is no one in the store now.

297
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,950
The owner next door told me

298
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,790
there's no employee in the store now.

299
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,250
I'll go back immediately.

300
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,660
Thank you for taking Jiali to the hospital.

301
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,860
Did your manager punish you after that?

302
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,750
After he knew what happened to Jiali,

303
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,880
he was also worried.

304
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,490
So he didn't say anything.

305
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,050
That's good.

306
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,670
Jiali became like that

307
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,000
because she waited for her boyfriend on the street at night.

308
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
She waited 56 minutes and 8 seconds.

309
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,320
It's safer to call a taxi.

310
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
A few days ago, the borough warden told me

311
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,780
a girl was followed.

312
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,690
So it's better to be careful.

313
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,820
It's okay.

314
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,860
My boyfriend will come to pick me up.

315
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,470
Your boyfriend hasn't come yet?

316
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,200
Not yet. I'm waiting for him to pick me up.

317
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,610
Let me take you home.

318
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't bother.

319
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,640
Let me take you home.

320
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,600
Your boyfriend is here. I'm leaving.

321

He's not my...

323
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,780
What took you so long?

324
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,910
When her boyfriend showed up,

325
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,550
he blamed her for getting off work so late

326
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,680
because she took someone else's shift.

327
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,420
In the end,

328
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,650
she kept apologizing to her boyfriend.

329
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,630
Sun Jiali really gives me a headache.

330
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,570
You stayed to wait for her.

331
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,230
Why did you hide

332
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,310
instead of accompanying her openly?

333
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,520
We are not familiar.

334
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,950
I was worried...

335
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,850
she would feel uncomfortable.

336
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,680
You're so thoughtful.

337
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,540
Could it be that you like Jiali?

338
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,250
No way.

339
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,770
I was just saying.

340
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,840
This is for Jiali.

341
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,250
Please help me give it to her.

342
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:49,850

-Isn't that Mr. Zhang?
-to do my best to achieve a win-win situation

352
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,270
and shorten the time spent on the contract.

353
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,510
Haikuo offended him before, right?

354
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,360
When did their relationship

355
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,580
become so harmonious?

356
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,980
I'm very satisfied with this cooperation.

357
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,670
I'll introduce some of my good friends

358
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,610
to you.

362
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,530
Then we'll give it to your company to stamp a seal to complete the contract signing.

363

364
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,610
By the way,

-He's giving him a gift.
-It's

368
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,150
my family's heirloom.

369
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,860
-Mr. Zhang is giving a gift to Haikuo.
-Thank you.

370
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,110
Not at all.

-What's going on?
-On behalf of Keke,

I thank you, Mr. Zhang.

373
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,110
But

374
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,860
I'm very curious.

375
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,390
You're in the Business Department.

376
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,300
Keke is in the Accounting Department.

377
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,760
Last time, you stood me up

378
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,880
because of her.

379
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,700
Then

380
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,250
you came with her to apologize to me.

381
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,660
You're in a good relationship, right?

382
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,680
We're just friends for now.

383
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,300
But I like her.

384
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,530
I'm pursuing her.

385
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,080
You have a crush on her?

386
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,190
I will make her fall in love with me.

387
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,880
Very good.

388
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,880
That's what a man should do.

389
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,350
Don't

390
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,550
hide your love.

391
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,050
If you like someone, just say it bravely.

392
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,870
Right?

393
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,130
-Right?
-Yes.

394
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,260
Also,

395
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,460
I should put it into practice

396
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,840
and be perseverant.

397
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,460
You really don't know

398
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,040
how scary Jian Keke is.

399
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,960
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

400
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,040
Let me walk you out to your car.

401
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,010
No.

402
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,200
I insist.

403
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,350
Haikuo is really amazing.

404
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,470
He offended Mr. Zhang

405
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,170
and messed up the collaboration not long ago.

406
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,570
It's only been a few days.

407
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,270
I didn't expect their relationship to be so harmonious.

408
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,560
He even gave a gift.

409
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,790
That's right.

410
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,190
Could it be

411
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,250
that it was actually a rumor

412
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,710
that he offended Mr. Zhang?

413
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,190
Or are they relatives?

414
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,300
Otherwise, why did he give a gift?

415
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,160
Whatever.

416
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,310
That's not the point.

417
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,220
The point is

418
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,300
whether Haikuo will know we're gossiping about him like this,

419
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,140
considering what happened last time.

420
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,830
Anyway,

421
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,750
we're not the only ones gossiping about him.

422
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,150
It should be okay, right?

423
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,550
You're right.

424
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,600
Tonight,

425
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,690
the Business Department will have a celebratory get-together.

426
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,980
I'd like to invite everyone in the Accounting Department

427
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,070
to join us.

428
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,000
The Business Department's get-together?

429
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,330
Why do you want to invite us from the Accounting Department?

430
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,860
We managed to secure

431
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,810
the contract this time

432
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,330
because Jian Keke helped us a lot.

433
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,240
I get paid.

434
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,000
It was my duty.

435
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,880
Then... Jian Keke will confirm the number.

436
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,240
After I book a restaurant,

437
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,640
I'll text you guys the time and the address.

438
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,710
Who wants to go?

439
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,940
I want to go.

440
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,820
Me, too.

441
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,740
Elly, aren't you going?

442
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,050
No, I'm not going.

443
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,870
Okay.

444
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,890
Do you know what kind of help Keke offered?

445
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,630
No, I don't.

446
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,220
That's strange.

447
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,620
There was a chance to get to know a rich guy,

448
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,420
but she didn't seize the chance.

449
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,500
That's strange.

450
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,450
It's a bit strange indeed.

451
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,870
Judging from her personality,

452
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,490
I don't think

453
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,590
she would give up the chance so easily.

454
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,110
Right?

455
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,320
Has her appetite changed?

456
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,930
Or does she have a bigger appetite now?

457
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,740
Does she think that he's not rich enough?

458
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,200
There's something fishy about it.

459
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,770
I don't think the case is simple.

460
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,130
Eat it now.

461
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,760
The lunch break will be over soon.

462
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,360
Is your grandma angry?

463
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,620
Actually, she's not really angry.

464
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,990
I think that she's just

465
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,270
worried about me.

466
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,780
Of course.

467
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,920
You're her dear granddaughter.

468
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,850
Of course she's worried about you.

469
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,050
By the way,

470
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,000
your colleague asked me to give it to you.

471
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,290
My colleague?

472
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:57,960
A tall guy.

473
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,930
What's his name?

474
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,620
Yuanchong.

475
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,880
No wonder he specially came to see me.

476
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,910
He probably wanted to give this to me.

477
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,040
Have you been working with him for a long time?

478
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,770
He has just joined our company.

479
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,910
Actually, I don't know him well.

480
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,170
He doesn't talk much

481
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,340
and is silent.

482
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,090
You two don't know each other well, but he cares about you.

483
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,960
Good.

484
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,480
I think this is okay.

485
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:20,900
What is okay?

486
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,560
It's okay that he can be your new boyfriend.

487
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,090
Miss Jian Keke.

488
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,430
Why not?

489
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
I think he's good.

490
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,550
He's tall and cute.

491
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,060
I think he's upright and considerate.

492
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,810
He's 100 times better

493
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,540
-than your useless boyfriend.
-Hurry up and eat.

494
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,780
I really think that he's good.

495
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,040
If you go on talking about it,

496
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,910
-I'll introduce him to you.
-Then I'll…

497
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,550
No need.

498
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,720
You seem to like him a lot.

499
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,050
No need. I'm short of money, but I'm not short of a boyfriend.

500
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,050
He's really good.

501
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,080
You're so early.

502
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,330
I think, as a salesman,

503
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,860
it's a basic rule to arrive ahead of time.

504
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,290
Please give me a cup of iced Americano.

505
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:34,890
Thank you.

506
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,920
I got your message today.

507
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,530
I thought you sent it to the wrong person.

508
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,090
I know that we barely associate with each other

509
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,950
in the company at ordinary times.

510
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,990
So I asked you out today

511
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,920
to tell you something good.

512
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,310
I believe you know that

513
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,120
Wang Haikuo, the newcomer in our company,

514
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,860
has recently persuaded Mr. Zhang to cooperate with him.

515
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,590
I still remember that Mr. Zhang

516
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,060
once severely criticized the proposal

517
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,290
put forward by you.

518
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,420
Don't look so angry.

519
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,360
Otherwise,

520
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,720
how can I continue to talk about

521
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,660
Jian Keke?

522
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,700
Jian Keke.

523
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,490
That's interesting.

524
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,460
I think you know that

525
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,430
Jian Keke is obsessed with money.

526
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,150
But for an unknown reason,

527
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,130
recently, she has taken the initiative to spend 30 bucks

528
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,260
buying the milk which Haikuo gave her.

529
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,780
Jian Keke took the initiative to spend money?

530
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,870
So,

531
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,890
I want to cooperate with you.

532
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,130
For what?

533
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,650
Do you still

534
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,520
have feelings for Jian Keke?

535
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,990
It's my treat today.

536
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,420
So everyone,

537
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,710
please order as much as you want.

538
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,310
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

539
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,620
[Price of Food]

540
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,490
This is too expensive.

541
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,390
Why don't you just treat us to some stir-fried food?

542
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,450
What are you treating us to barbeque?

543
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,390
Then the bonus will be used up.

544
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,980
I want three portions of Wagyu beef, please.

545
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,790
Three portions of Wagyu beef.

546
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,650
Three portions of Wagyu beef cost 7,500 NT dollars.

547
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,650
What's wrong?

548
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,430
Nothing.

549
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,340
Girls will gain weight easily if they eat too much meat at night.

550
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,200
But I'm not trying to lose weight.

551
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,220
Eating meat will make you fat.

552
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,030
Then let's order some seafood.

553
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,020
Two portions of lobsters.

554
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,950
-Two portions of lobsters. Okay.
-Alright.

555
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,460
-I want three portions of lobsters, please.

556
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,060
Three portions of lobsters.

557
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,980
With their way of ordering the food like this,

558
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,180
I think I'll have to spend two months' salary on this meal.

559
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,940
It's okay.

560
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,530
When I booked a table, I also ordered some food.

561
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,030
Later, if the food isn't enough,

562
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,110
we can order again.

563
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,610
You're so considerate.

564
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,350
You're so generous.

565
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,010
It's burnt.

566
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,550
Congratulations to you on getting a big order, Mr. Wang.

567
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,540
Congratulations, Mr. Wang.

568
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,420
Congratulations!

569
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,310
Thank you.

570
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,250
Mr. Wang.

571
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,480
So many people are drinking a toast to you, so you should drink it up.

572
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
Of course.

573
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,690
Mr. Wang can really drink a lot.

574
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,560
Awesome!

575
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,890
It's all thanks to you guys this time.

576
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,540
So,

577
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,260
eat as much as you want and drink as much beer as you want.

578
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,220
-Okay.
-Right. Let's eat as much as we want.

579
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,010
Mr. Wang, that piece of beef is very delicious.

580
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,860
Eat more.

581
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,200
Mr. Wang,

582
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,290
this shrimp is very chewy.

583
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,860
Come on. Taste it, too.

584
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,800
Thank you.

585
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,100
Keke, you're too thin.

586
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,870
Eat more.

587
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,640
Thank you.

588
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,390
You should eat more, too.

589
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,090
Don't drink too much.

590
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,040
Drinking alcohol is bad for your health.

591
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,070
You're right.

592
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,270
Health is important.

593
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,990
Mr. Wang.

594
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,790
I don't mean that

595
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,330
you shouldn't drink at all.

596
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,130
I mean, when others drink a toast to you, you just need to

597
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,580
drink a little to show courtesy.

598
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,240
There's no need to drink it up.

599
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,010
That makes sense.

600
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,540
Health and manners are both important.

601
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,240
Mr... Mr. Wang.

602
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,030
How obedient.

603
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,480
No woman can resist a man who is so loyal like a dog.

604
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,460
I got this first.

605
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,470
It's obvious that I got it first.

606
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,740
Just eat something else.

607
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,870
You're so petty.

608
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,700
No wonder your performance ranks last.

609
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,060
Get closer to each other.

610
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,490
Those who stand at the back, don't be blocked.

611
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,820
Come on. Smile happily.

612
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,750
Three, two, one.

613
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,260
It's done.

614
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,630
Thank you.

615
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,510
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

616
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,300
-Mr. Wang.
-Thank you, Mr. Wang.

617
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,720
Then we'll go to the KTV to get a room first.

618
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,280
See you later. Bye.

619
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,720
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

620
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,410
Bye.

621
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,460
-Let's go.
-Bye.

622
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,440
Keke.

623
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,540
What?

624
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,360
Will you also go to the KTV later?

625
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,600
No.

626
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,240
I have to go back to put the desserts in the refrigerator.

627
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,330
Then let me give you a ride.

628
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,060
No need. It's too troublesome.

629
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,320
Actually, I have something to tell you.

630
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,390
What is it? Just tell me now.

631
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,870
I have to tell you here?

632
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,270
How about

633
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,010
telling me about it when you come to work tomorrow?

634
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,070
I'll go back first.

635
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,980
Don't force anything.

636
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,830
This shows that God gives you more time to think about it.

637
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,720
Mr. Wang.

638
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,680
It's not too late to repent now.

639
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,590
You're right.

640
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,840
I'm too impatient.

641
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,430
I should take it step by step.

642
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:32,600
No.

643
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,720
That's not what I mean.

644
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I...

645
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,280
-I mean...
-Make her have a crush on me first.

646
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,010
In that case, the chance of success for my confession of love

647
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,000
is 1,000 percent.

648
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,280
Mr. Wang, no.

649
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,130
Mr. Wang.

650
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,389
It's so good that I can

651
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,520
see you again.

652
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,030
[The amount of this transfer transaction: 100,000 NT dollars]

653
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,030
[Note: Education fees. Remittance failed.]

654
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,570
Why did I have such a nightmare?

655
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,550
Is this a warning?

656
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,150
[Trendee]

657
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,840
It's such a large bouquet.

658
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,080
It's so beautiful.

659
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,810
These are real flowers.

660
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,380
So romantic.

661
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,830
Seeing Elly smile like that,

662
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,100
I think there must be something wrong.

663
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,300
Why are you all standing around my desk?

664
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,660
Keke.

665
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,630
You're finally here.

666
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,800
I've just checked it online.

667
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,350
The Taurus will have luck for love today.

668
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,200
Cupid is ready to shoot his arrow.

669
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,950
Go and see who gave you the flowers.

670
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,800
Who gave you the flowers?

671
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,630
Keke.

672
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,760
I think you must have been a carbonated beverage in your previous life.

673
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,950
Otherwise, why am I so happy with love bubbles

674
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,130
whenever I see you?

675
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,250
Michael Zhao!

676
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,440
Is everything okay with Mr. Zhang's project?

677
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,030
Yes.

678
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,160
Keep an eye on it closely.

679
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,240
Don't make them feel slighted.

680
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,300
Then help me make an appointment with Mr. Sun.

681
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,730
Mr. Sun

682
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,200
seems to have decided on his cooperation partner.

683
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,660
I know he has decided on it.

684
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,790
But just help me make an appointment.

685
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,850
Okay. Got it.

686
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,910
Mr. Zhao.

687
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,810
-You're back from your vacation?
-Mr. Zhao.

688
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,220
[Michael Zhao, Manger of Division Three of the Business Department, a very confident man who is handsome in a non-mainstream way]

689
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,630
I'm sorry.

690
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,940
I'm used to it.

691
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,580
Hello.

692
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,010
I'm Wang Haikuo from Division One.

693
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,240
The skin of your hands is so rough.

694
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,200
Does Keke like this type?

695
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,910
The skin of my hands

696
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,770
is just too tender and too soft.

697
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,330
You look stern with an angular face.

698
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,720
You have dark and deep eyes,

699
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,460
thick eyebrows,

700
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,510
a high nose,

701
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,850
and a perfect lip shape.

702
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,030
You're really the same as people said.

703
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,460
You're as good as me.

704
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,150
Mr. Zhao, what can I do for you?

705
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,120
Call me Michael Zhao.

706
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,070
Michael Zhao.

707
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,580
What can I do for you, please?

708
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:30,910
Nothing.

709
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,820
I went on a vacation previously.

710
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,600
I haven't had a chance to say hello to you.

711
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,690
We finally met each other.

712
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,250
Hello.

713
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,050
I'm thinking

714
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,940
in the future, we'll

715
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,870
have many chances to communicate with each other.

716
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,180
That's strange.

717
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,820
Mr. Zhao's business objects

718
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,710
are usually some chairwomen

719
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,130
or rich married women.

720
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,550
Why do I feel that

721
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,150
he's targeting you now?

722
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,870
Really?

723
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,750
I think

724
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,320
it's just a competition between men.

725
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,000
A competition?

726
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,540
Really?

727
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,300
Michael Zhao.

728
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,440
Why did Michael Zhao suddenly appear?

729
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,360
Keke.

730
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Why are you looking at me in that way?

731
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,300
Nothing. I'm thinking about something.

732
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,280
What's wrong?

733
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,240
This is the reimbursement form of the Design Department.

734
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,320
It was among the Business Department's receipts

735
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,780
which you gave me just now.

736
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,560
I'm sorry.

737
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:04,930
Thank you.

738
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,570
Jian Keke.

739
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,900
What should I do?

740
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,060
What's wrong with Keke?

741
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,540
This shows that

742
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,690
she's scared.

743
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,540
I'm afraid

744
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,060
she's under a lot of pressure now.

745
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,610
Jian Keke, what are you doing?

746
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,960
There seems to be something wrong with this account.

747
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,060
Check it for me.

748
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,200
I'm sorry.

749
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,770
This one.

750
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,930
Check it for me.

751
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,070
Okay. I...

752
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,790
I'll check it again later and then give it to you.

753
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,690
-Thank you.
-Thanks for your hard work.

754
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,800
Okay. I'm sorry.

755
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,950
Keke, is there something urgent?

756
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
How come you have that kind of smell?

757
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,920
It's so disgusting.

758
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,420
What smell do I have?

759
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,660
I think that's the smell.

760
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,610
It's Michael Zhao's smell.

761
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,870
Michael Zhao's smell?

762
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,620
Yes.

763
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,340
You probably don't know that

764
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,430
Keke is very scared of Michael Zhao.

765
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,330
Because Michael Zhao

766
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,370
once pursued Keke crazily.

767
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,540
Very crazily.

768
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:28,170
I'll go wash my hands first and then attend the meeting.

769
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,190
Ten bucks.

770
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,660
Jian Keke.

771
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,470
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

772
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,340
Seeing your expression, I know that

773
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,160
you haven't forgotten me.

774
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,390
[Preview]

775
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,790
I'm not the one who Michael Zhao likes.

776
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,370
I didn't force him to chase you, either.

777
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,520
Please don't waste everyone's time.

778
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,110
We still have work to do. Get lost!

779
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,370
You're not saying what you really think.

780
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,850
Why do you like to take away someone else's boyfriend so much?

781
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,500
Why are we wearing the same bracelets?

782
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,580
There are many swindlers now.

783
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,730
Some cheat others for money, and some cheat others for sex.

784
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,040
Who are you calling a swindler?

785
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,260
So you want to chase Jian Keke again?

786
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,730
I like Jian Keke, too.

787
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,050
Let's compete with each other fairly.

788
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,350
Later, when I throw the bridal bouquet,

789
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,700
you must catch it.

790
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,790
I like you.

791
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,300
Will you be my girlfriend?
