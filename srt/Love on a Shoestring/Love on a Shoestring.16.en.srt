4
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,890
Good night, Manager.

5
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,150
Good night, Manager.

6
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,259
Manager.

7
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,910
Good night.

8
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,050
Good night.

9
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,979
Excuse me, why are you

10
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:45,740
all here

11
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,100
so late?

12
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,400
Manager.

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,550
We really feel that something bad is going to happen,

14
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,930
so we came to you so late.

15
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,870
So, what's going on?

16
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,550
Everyone in the group chat is saying

17
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,620
that Keke is going to give us a hard time.

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,720
She won't approve any of our department's

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,990
budget requests.

20
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,550
Manager, just go apologize.

21
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,350
If your apology

22
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,990
can calm Keke's anger,

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,060
I'll go with you to apologize.

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,820
I'll even kneel if necessary.

25
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,720
That's just a rumor.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

27
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,490
I've been threatened by Keke before.

28
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,550
She will do anything

29
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,170
to achieve her goals.

30
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,990
This is definitely not a rumor.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,550
Chen Shi, you...

32
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,790
Misunderstood.

33
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,690
Keke is not like that.

34
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,030
Manager, one apology.

35
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,310
Just one apology,

36
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,100
please.

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,420
Let our department have a way to survive.

38
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,350
Manager,

39
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,620
I have parents to support,

40
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,460
and two younger brothers and two younger sisters.

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,320
I really can't lose this job.

42
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,990
Manager, please.

43
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,890
Manager, please.

44
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,090
I really like this job.

45
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,030
I don't want to give it up.

46
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,329
Manager.

47
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,690
-Please.
-Wait a minute.

48
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,430
Please.

49
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,690
Please. Manager.

50
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,760
Hold on. Okay.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,360
My head, my head is spinning.

52
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,300
Alright.

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,310
I'll go apologize.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,890
I'll lower my head.

55
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,790
I'll admit my mistake.

56
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,960
I'll beg Keke to let our department go.

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,620
Just let me go first.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Seriously?

59
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,820
Yes.

60
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,290
Wait a minute.

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,810
Let's

62
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,079
pinky swear.

63
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,270
Pinky swear.

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,710
-Pinky swear.
-Promise.

65
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,490
Promise.

66
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,320
Promise two.

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,920
Promise three.

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,350
Okay, get out of here.

69
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,420
Go back and rest.

70
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,200
It's late.

71
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,490
What are you doing?

72
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,220
I thought

73
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,680
people were only interested in love gossip.

74
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,360
I didn't expect they could

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,890
make up so many stories about mutual harm too?

76
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,800
What stories?

77
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,710
Tell me.

78
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,190
The latest one

79
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,090
is from your department.

80
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,370
It says you're already planning to have someone kidnap me.

81
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,170
The more updated one

82
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,820
says you colluded with my family cupboard

83
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,950
to hit me on the head.

84
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,690
You're so cute.

85
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,890
How could I possibly bear to kidnap you?

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,110
What should we do?

87
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,520
Things are getting more and more out of hand.

88
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,650
How are we going to get along in the company in the future?

89
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,659
What to do indeed?

90
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,900
Yeah, what to do?

91
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,100
Whoever stirred this up should solve it.

92
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,120
I didn't think things would turn out this way.

93
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,290
Neither did I.

94
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,920
Please.

95
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,220
Think of a way.

96
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,840
I know I was wrong.

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
Using the same trick?

98
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,010
One trick should be enough, right?

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,120
Please!

100
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,340
Think of a way.

101
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,910
You're so smart.

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,830
I'm begging you.

103
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,580
Please.

104
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,940
Alright, I have an idea.

105
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,670
Really?

106
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,290
I knew you were the smartest.

107
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,130
Please enjoy.

108
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Why such thoughtful service?

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,390
Not bad, right?

110
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,150
It could be even more thoughtful.

111
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,880
Thanks.

112
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,960
How are you eating?

113
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,840
There's sauce all over your nose.

114
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,580
Gosh.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,159
Let's eat.

116
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,610
Are they dating?

117
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,680
I'll keep recording.

118
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,600
They were just here, weren't they?

119
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Where did they go?

120
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,300
Are you... are you

121
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,950
really dating?

122
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,670
That was so disgusting just now!

123
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,690
Did you get it on video?

124
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,820
Yes.

125
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,290
Are our

126
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,790
faces clear?

127
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,480
Very clear.

128
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,140
Alright.

129
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,980
As our witness,

130
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,040
your big moment is coming up.

131
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,960
My big moment?

132
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,820
You need to go back

133
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,120
and upload what you just recorded

134
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,330
to the company group chat.

135
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,430
And make sure

136
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,060
it spreads from one to ten, ten to a hundred,

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,390
a hundred to a thousand,

138
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,420
so the whole company

139
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,840
knows we're dating.

140
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,970
Okay?

141
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,190
Okay.

142
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,570
Do it.

143
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,480
Then you two continue eating.

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,650
I drank too much coffee this morning.

145
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,570
Now we put our hands together in front of our chest.

146
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,890
Slowly open our eyes.

147
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,990
And that's the end of today's class.

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,660
Namaste.

149
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,130
Thank you, everyone.

150
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,500
Thank you, teacher.

151
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,520
Goodbye, teacher.

152
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,360
Bye-bye.

153
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,190
You didn't fall asleep today.

154
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,520
Nice, making progress.

155
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,990
-Thank you.
-Do you and our teacher

156
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,150
know each other?

157
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,300
We're friends.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,830
Probably more than just friends, right?

159
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,010
When you fell asleep that day,

160
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,020
the teacher specifically asked us

161
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,420
not to wake you up.

162
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,320
How long did you keep the teacher waiting that day?

163
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,650
About

164
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,780
two hours.

165
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,070
That's too long.

166
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,260
The teacher is really

167
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,090
patient with you.

168
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,230
You might be the teacher's type.

169
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,390
Please, everyone, stop speculating.

170
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,120
I like her.

171
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,370
I'm currently

172
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,310
pursuing her.

173
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,560
But the teacher

174
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,350
only cares for me as a friend,

175
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,520
nothing more.

176
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Teacher, why don't you like him?

177
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Yeah, teacher.

178
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,790
Why don't you like him?

179
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,440
Because

180
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,130
I don't think I can

181
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,190
make her happy yet.

182
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,310
But...

183
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:07,870
Jiali,

184
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,480
give me a little more time,

185
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,960
I will definitely become

186
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
someone you like

187
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,540
and rely on.

188
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,290
So handsome.

189
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,680
So passionate.

190
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,050
Can I add you as a friend?

191
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,290
Me too.

192
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,360
I want to add you too.

193
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,020
Add me first.

194
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,520
-Where's your phone?
-Add me.

195
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,750
Add me.

196
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,960
-Where’s your phone?
-Jia...

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
Where is your phone?

198
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,220
Add me first.

199
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,110
Add me first. Where's your phone?

200
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,660
Is she angry?

201
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,140
Why are you here?

202
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,870
I was just about to message you to apologize.

203
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,350
Why do you want to apologize to me?

204
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,360
I thought

205
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,330
I made you upset by saying I like you

206
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,830
in front of everyone,

207
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,100
so you ran off.

208
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,610
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

209
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm not mad at you.

210
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,340
I just didn't know

211
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,120
how to respond to you.

212
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,700
So...

213
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,460
You don't need to respond to me,

214
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,790
and you don't need to feel pressured.

215
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,270
I just didn't want everyone

216
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,530
to misunderstand you.

217
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,710
Are you free now?

218
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,550
Yes.

219
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,910
Can you

220
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,390
take me somewhere?

221
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,310
Sure.

222
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,940
This may just be an ordinary park,

223
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,130
but it

224
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,350
holds

225
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,060
my happiest memories.

226
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,230
So

227
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,500
you lived nearby when you were a child?

228
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,170
And you brought me here today because...

229
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,620
Because I want to

230
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
apologize to you.

231
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,060
Why are you apologizing to me?

232
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,990
You didn't do anything wrong to me.

233
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,530
Qianqian was right.

234
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,350
I shouldn't

235
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,500
have judged your choices.

236
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,720
And I shouldn't have assumed

237
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,410
I knew what was best for you.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,250
I know you meant well.

239
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,770
You made me

240
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,180
really think

241
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,350
about my dream.

242
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,540
I should thank you.

243
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,850
But

244
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,870
having a dream

245
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,720
isn't anything great.

246
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,690
When I think about it,

247
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,860
maybe my dream

248
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,650
was forced upon me.

249
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,740
What do you mean?

250
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,850
Baking is my interest,

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,280
but my drive

252
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,600
to achieve a goal

253
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,770
and gain a sense of accomplishment

254
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,740
comes from

255
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,560
wanting my parents' attention.

256
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,130
I want them to be proud of me.

257
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,790
I often imagine

258
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,170
them holding

259
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,410
one of my cakes

260
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,750
and showing it off to the neighbors,

261
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,090
saying their daughter made it.

262
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,440
So I've been working hard in that direction.

263
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,720
I even wanted to open a bakery.

264
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,650
But I realized that inside,

265
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,900
I'm not very strong.

266
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,220
I need a goal

267
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,800
to strive for.

268
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,830
If I don't even have a dream,

269
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,870
then I'd have nothing.

270
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,350
No,

271
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,070
you won't have nothing.

272
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,520
You still have your grandma,

273
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,350
Keke,

274
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,050
and me.

275
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,270
I know.

276
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,950
But it's different.

277
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,170
They're my parents.

278
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,900
They used to love me so much.

279
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,950
Sometimes I wonder

280
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,790
what I did wrong.

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,990
Why

282
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,460
did their love for me

283
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,760
suddenly disappear?

284
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,400
I really

285
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,770
miss them sometimes.

286
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,610
Don't be sad.

287
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm not your parents.

288
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,360
So

289
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,900
I don't know why love would disappear.

290
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,840
But I can promise you

291
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,080
that I won't

292
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
suddenly disappear from your life.

293
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,750
So,

294
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,380
before I find my dream,

295
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,730
I want to do what I want to do.

296
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,960
So I'll still go to the charity sale that day.

297
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,790
Even though

298
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,280
I can't help you bake cakes,

299
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,110
I can

300
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,600
help you sell things and carry stuff.

301
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,660
Leave everything except cake-making

302
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,500
to me.

303
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,070
Hurry up and put on your sweater.

304
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,310
This

305
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,360
is for you.

306
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,380
Are you following me?

307
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,580
Who is following you?

308
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,390
I thought you were following me.

309
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,270
I don't have that much time to follow you.

310
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,130
I'm going on a date with Eric

311
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,110
I’m turning right.

312
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,510
I’m going home to take care of my inner beauty.

313
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,970
I’m turning left.

314
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,490
You need to go back

315
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,620
and upload what you just recorded

316
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,000
to the company group chat

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,190
And make sure

318
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,690
it spreads from one to ten, ten to a hundred,

319
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,020
a hundred to a thousand,

320
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,090
so the whole company

321
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,280
knows we're dating.

322
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,000
For immediate effect,

323
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,500
I should send it to someone who can spread it quickly.

324
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,700
Who should I send it to?

325
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,300
Yes.

326
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,440
Her.

327
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,730
Why is he messaging me?

328
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,700
Could it be

329
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,450
that he wants to ask me out?

330
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,800
I'm so smart.

331
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,160
Cheers.

332
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,820
Cheers.

333
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,190
I saw Eric

334
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,120
with another girl at the restaurant yesterday.

335
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,220
He has many girlfriends.

336
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm afraid you'll be cheated by a scumbag.

337
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,330
Are you trying to use a rumor

338
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,760
to drive a wedge between Eric and me?

339
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
What are you up to?

340
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,220
I have proof.

341
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,280
Michael Zhao!

342
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,930
Could Michael Zhao

343
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,240
be telling the truth?

344
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,100
Baby.

345
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,150
What's wrong?

346
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,760
Nothing.

347
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,360
Here's the thing.

348
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,660
My colleague said

349
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,560
he saw you having a meal

350
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,570
with a girl at a restaurant

351
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,490
and you seemed very close.

352
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,670
Your colleague must have misunderstood.

353
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,370
She’s

354
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,260
a very important banking client.

355
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,460
And you know that in our line of work,

356
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,380
such socializing is common.

357
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,730
I'm sorry, this was my fault.

358
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,380
From now on,

359
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,610
I’ll be more careful.

360
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,650
I knew she was a client.

361
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,480
My colleague really makes a fuss over nothing.

362
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,560
So annoying.

363
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,950
I'm sorry, baby.

364
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,870
It's okay.

365
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,680
Your colleague cares a lot about you.

366
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,300
I'm glad the misunderstanding is cleared up.

367
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,680
This is for you.

368
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,510
Open it.

369
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:53,910
You...

370
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,490
How did you know I wanted this scarf?

371
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,070
Of course I knew.

372
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,720
Because you’re the only woman in my heart.

373
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,320
Thank you.

374
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,350
I’ve also arranged everything

375
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,750
for the wedding cookies.

376
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,020
You just need to decide

377
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,890
where you want to go for the honeymoon.

378
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,190
Whether it’s Greece,

379
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,140
Dubai,

380
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,410
or the Maldives,

381
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,410
it’s up to you.

382
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,080
But won’t that

383
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,640
be too expensive?

384
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,070
Did you forget what I do for a living?

385
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,200
Besides, I have an investment project

386
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,380
that’s about to profit.

387
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,710
I calculated it.

388
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,590
The profit

389
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,020
is about threefold.

390
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,030
What kind of investment is that profitable?

391
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,580
Why didn’t you introduce it to me?

392
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,810
I'll handle

393
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,930
the money-making.

394
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,990
You just need to trust me.

395
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,000
And...

396
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,630
Just be my Mrs. Su.

397
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,540
OK?

398
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,350
Sure.

399
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,500
Cheers.

400
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,070
Cheers.

401
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,630
To be honest,

402
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,590
I’m more suited

403
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,800
to be with

404
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,280
a guy like Eric.

405
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,120
My client told me

406
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,730
Eric is very promiscuous.

407
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,860
He has many girlfriends.

408
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,680
If you don’t want to see me happy,

409
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,420
please leave my sight.

410
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,800
Go as far away as possible.

411
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,710
Never

412
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
speak to me again.

413
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,660
Elly still loves Eric.

414
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,510
I can’t ruin that for them.

415
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,820
You can’t go on like this.

416
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,770
Trash needs to be cleaned out.

417
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,100
If you leave it,

418
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,660
it will mold and attract cockroaches.

419
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,640
It will be a disaster.

420
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,030
Yes, you're right.

421
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,860
This is the Eric I told you about last time.

422
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,950
He’s very promiscuous.

423
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,530
He changes girlfriends every few days.

424
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,130
He’s deceiving girls again.

425
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,850
Yes.

426
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,350
You're right.

427
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
It will be a disaster and attract cockroaches.

428
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
Please take care of the trash for me.

429
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
I’m going to deal with the disaster.

430
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,410
Isn't it too fast?

431
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,020
Is this really okay?

432
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,920
What are you worried about?

433
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,790
I've found the best person

434
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,660
and made the right choice.

435
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,670
My future is shining with happiness.

436
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,660
You need to know when to cut your losses.

437
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,120
Stop thinking about that narcissistic guy.

438
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,700
Baby.

439
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,640
Are you done showering?

440
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,740
So fast?

441
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,840
On such a romantic night,

442
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,490
How can I keep my baby

443
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,620
waiting for so long?

444
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,160
I haven't showered yet.

445
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,330
I'll go take a shower first.

446
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,800
Okay.

447
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,940
Take your time.

448
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,450
Anyway, tonight

449
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,840
is all about us.

450
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,220
I'll wait for you.

451
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,490
That woman trusts me now.

452
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,780
I'll get the money soon.

453
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,840
Elly even ordered room service?

454
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,140
What is it?

455
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,030
Elly!

456
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:37,860
What are you doing?

457
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,280
-Elly.
-Who are you?

458
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,180
What are you doing?

459
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,640
Go away!

460
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,420
Elly!

461
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,190
How could you just

462
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,850
-barge in like this?
-Elly!

463
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,410
-What are you doing?
-Elly!

464
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,710
You...

465
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,980
Why are you here?

466
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,520
And why are you dressed like that?

467
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,060
I'm here to deal with the trash.

468
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,650
Come with me.

469
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,570
Hold on.

470
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,490
You just burst in here,

471
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,480
attacked me,

472
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,510
and slandered me.

473
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,850
I can sue you, you know?

474
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,660
You scammer!

475
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,590
I won't let you deceive Elly

476
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,120
for money or anything else.

477
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,040
Enough!

478
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,920
You said Eric is a player.

479
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,290
Fine, I won't argue about that.

480
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,630
But now you're saying he's a con artist?

481
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,700
What do you want?

482
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,430
This guy is married

483
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,670
and proposed to you.

484
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,660
What do you call that

485
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,460
if not deceit?

486
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,920
Married?

487
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,510
No.

488
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,960
Elly, don't listen to his nonsense.

489
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
He's just jealous

490
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,990
that I have you.

491
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,990
He's just here to stir up trouble.

492
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,870
Don't listen to him.

493
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,840
Ignore him.

494
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,040
Funny!

495
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,600
Jealous of you?

496
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,570
About what? Your body?

497
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,780
Maybe your body is a bit better than mine,

498
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,730
but your skin

499
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,830
is nowhere close.

500
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,770
Why would I be jealous of you?

501
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,360
If you don't admit it, fine.

502
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,490
Let the evidence speak for itself.

503
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,540
Why are you here?

504
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,650
Ma'am, sorry

505
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,200
to meet like this in a hotel room.

506
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,510
Ma'am?

507
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,910
I'm Eric's wife.

508
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,640
What skincare do you use?

509
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,620
I already asked.

510
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,690
It's not about skincare.

511
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,640
She's the friend of one of my clients.

512
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,620
Next year,

513
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,220
she's turning 66.

514
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,740
Sixty.

515
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,140
Sorry.

516
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,820
Do you have a mother complex?

517
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,000
No,

518
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,660
he just loves my money.

519
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,890
Once I give him all my money,

520
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,610
he plans to divorce me.

521
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,520
I won't agree

522
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,310
and he's left home.

523
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,990
Now

524
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,930
he's seeing you,

525
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,370
a young girl.

526
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,050
You despicable man.

527
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,780
Listen.

528
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,520
Stop playing the victim.

529
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,360
You came here with me.

530
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,640
You aren't any better.

531
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,810
Bastard!

532
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,690
Honey!

533
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,850
Don't talk about Elly like that.

534
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,590
Honey!

535
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,140
Honey, wake up!

536
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,260
Are you okay?

537
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:36,990
Wake up!

538
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,970
Don't look. It's dirty.

539
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,650
Let's go home.

540
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,910
Honey!

541
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,130
Are you okay?

542
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,120
Wake up!

543
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,840
Honey.

544
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,260
He deceived so many women.

545
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,650
He tarnished our reputation.

546
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,420
I'll teach him a lesson.

547
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,610
He has to be punished by the law.

548
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,540
Don't be afraid.

549
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,330
If you need to call the police

550
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,360
and need a witness, I can testify for you.

551
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,190
If one person isn't enough,

552
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,120
the whole company will back you up.

553
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,870
What's wrong?

554
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:12,940
Are you

555
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,550
in shock?

556
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,440
Are you okay?

557
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,490
Are you okay?

558
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:19,890
You...

559
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,190
Stop shaking me.

560
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,930
I'm so dizzy.

561
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,210
I'm glad you're okay.

562
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,690
Thank goodness you were here.

563
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,640
We need to teach that scumbag a lesson.

564
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,840
Let's go to the police station after this.

565
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,500
No.

566
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,600
We need to go to the emergency room first.

567
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,420
Why?

568
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,690
My hand.

569
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,530
I think I broke it

570
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,380
hitting that jerk.

571
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Can you drive?

572
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,280
Yes.

573
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,140
Help me.

574
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,570
Get in the car.

575
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,280
Hurry!

576
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,430
Help me!

577
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,270
It hurts.

578
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,390
She's Haikuo's girlfriend.

579
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,090
Jian Keke.

580
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,570
She's 25

581
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,030
and works in the Accounting Department at Haikuo's company.

582
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,030
An only child.

583
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,750
Her father Jian Fuyun is the borough warden.

584
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,590
And her mother Zhang Chunjiao is a homemaker.

585
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,090
They have no criminal record.

586
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,540
A decent family.

587
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,750
A decent family?

588
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,000
A decent family

589
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,700
means nothing special.

590
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,100
And that's the girl he likes?

591
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,800
This girl

592
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,010
doesn't match our family.

593
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,250
Keke.

594
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,900
Didn't I tell you

595
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,990
not to date someone from work?

596
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,250
-I…
-Why didn't you listen?

597
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,800
You're about to fall into the abyss.

598
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,140
-You...
-You.

599
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,380
Yes, you.

600
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,500
You're too naive.

601
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,670
Too naive.

602
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,560
Even though it's not what I imagined,

603
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,130
at least now everyone knows

604
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,450
I'm dating Haikuo.

605
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,250
It should stop the rumors.

606
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,850
Yes.

607
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,160
Congratulations on beating Elly

608
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,660
and becoming Haikuo's girlfriend.

609
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,650
Now, tell me,

610
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,500
how deep is your love for Haikuo?

611
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,160
When were you here?

612
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,310
Why are you asking me this?

613
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,170
That's not important.

614
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:35,860
Just answer me.

615
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,730
How much do you love Haikuo?

616
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,360
How long will it last?

617
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,760
Can you promise forever?

618
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,630
I...

619
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,420
Can you?

620
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,490
-Answer me.
-I...

621
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,180
I asked Haikuo.

622
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,090
What did he say?

623
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,070
He said,

624
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,610
"This is between me and Keke.

625
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,810
Our love doesn't need to be explained."

626
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,700
Our love?

627
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,510
Sounds pretty firm.

628
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,360
Oh no,

629
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,740
I only bet three months.

630
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,260
What three months?

631
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,520
It's definitely more than three months.

632
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,890
I need to get my wallet.

633
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,060
-I need to change it.
-What three months?

634
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,380
What three months?

635
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,460
What's going on?

636
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,000
I'll change it to one week.

637
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,020
One week?

638
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,400
I think it will be a year.

639
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,990
Wait,

640
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,920
give me a moment.

641
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,260
I'm indecisive.

642
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,660
What are you doing?

643
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,300
No, wait.

644
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,270
More than a week.

645
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,810
They're placing bets.

646
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,030
On what?

647
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,890
The whole company

648
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,890
is betting on how long you and Haikuo will be together.

649
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,730
Why would they bet on that?

650
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,140
Because one of you loves spending money,

651
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,490
and the other is super thrifty.

652
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,310
You're totally different.

653
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,660
Your relationship

654
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,430
is very unpredictable.

655
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,190
So the three months

656
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,990
you mentioned

657
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,160
is about us not lasting

658
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,490
more than three months?

659
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,500
Not just three months.

660
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,310
Someone even bet on a week.

661
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,360
But don't worry,

662
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,960
some people have faith in you

663
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,120
and bet on one year.

664
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,220
Haikuo and I will be together

665
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,590
for a very very very long time.

666
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,220
The kind that you can't bet on.

667
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,630
Are you sure about a very very very long time?

668
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,890
Then I'll place my bet.

669
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,250
Didn't you say office romances are cursed?

670
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,780
Then why are you doing this?

671
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,090
I don't support office romances,

672
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,850
but

673
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,950
a bet is a bet.

674
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,990
Elly, did you bet too?

675
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,630
I didn't participate.

676
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,970
You didn't?

677
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,120
Your relationship with Haikuo

678
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,590
is none of my business.

679
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,020
Whether it's

680
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,420
a day, a year,

681
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,430
or a lifetime,

682
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,650
I wish you happiness.

683
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,970
Really?

684
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,240
Because

685
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,820
I've found my own love

686
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,640
and I'm confident in it.

687
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,860
So,

688
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,230
I sincerely wish you and Haikuo

689
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,280
happiness.

690
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,590
Thank you.

691
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,690
It seems like you and your fiancé

692
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,870
are very happy.

693
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,980
Congratulations.

694
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,840
See this?

695
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,860
See this?

696
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,270
This is my pride,

697
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,969
my badge of honor,

698
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,840
and my symbol of bravery.

699
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,070
It's your badge of honor,

700
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,219
but I feel uncomfortable

701
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,030
seeing your middle finger.

702
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,469
Really?

703
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,040
Thank you so much.

704
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,810
You did a great job.

705
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,000
You stood up for all women

706
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,650
and most importantly,

707
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,030
you saved Elly.

708
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,240
So, you and Elly are good now?

709
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,630
Of course.

710
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,680
Look.

711
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,670
All these are from her:

712
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,790
oatmeal,

713
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,150
fresh juice,

714
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,890
yogurt,

715
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,870
fruit,

716
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,980
and salad.

717
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,370
More importantly,

718
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,130
look.

719
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,600
[Thank you, Michael Zhao. Have a great day, Elly]

720
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,360
And this card.

721
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,980
It smells like Elly.

722
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,100
Look.

723
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,090
It's all

724
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,250
my favorite

725
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,880
healthy food.

726
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,540
And the layout is so exquisite.

727
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,090
Elly knows me too well.

728
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,360
Excuse me.

729
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,010
Why are you still standing here?

730
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,010
You can leave now.

731
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,740
I won't share it with you.

732
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,710
Enjoy.

733
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,830
Go.

734
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,240
Don't need to be here.

735
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,550
Fresh.

736
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,110
Sunny.

737
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,180
Getting up early is like...

738
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,370
Why are you here?

739
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,410
Waiting for you.

740
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,140
Waiting for me?

741
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,080
You want to know

742
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,390
if I liked the breakfast you sent?

743
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,260
No.

744
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,780
I'm here to apologize.

745
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,760
Sorry,

746
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,400
I overreacted the other day

747
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,340
and misunderstood you,

748
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,760
thinking you were badmouthing Eric.

749
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,790
It's okay.

750
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,100
I was just concerned for

751
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,670
a friend

752
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,580
and a colleague.

753
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,270
I wasn't trying to slander him.

754
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,640
Just

755
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,380
concerned?

756
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,100
Not jealous of me and Eric?

757
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,880
Jealous?

758
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,280
Why would I be jealous of Eric?

759
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,150
Besides,

760
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,020
I'm much better than Eric.

761
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,980
Alright.

762
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,160
I forgot that

763
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,930
you only have eyes

764
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,600
for yourself.

765
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,300
You sound

766
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,270
upset.

767
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,280
Not at all.

768
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,720
You think too much.

769
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
I'm just

770
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,540
very grateful to you.

771
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,170
No.

772
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,920
My intuition tells me

773
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,040
otherwise.

774
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,370
Fine.

775
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,780
I'll prove

776
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,280
I'm not mad at you at all.

777
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,900
Is your phone more interesting than me?

778
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,640
Yes.

779
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,880
I need to see

780
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,230
what everyone is saying in the group chat.

781
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,410
But I think

782
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,070
it's a wise decision.

783
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,790
In this way,

784
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,100
we don't have to hide

785
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,370
and we can date openly in the office.

786
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,710
How open can office romance be?

787
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,670
For example,

788
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,110
can I hold your hand in the office?

789
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,070
Yes.

790
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,490
Can I kiss you?

791
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,260
Of course not.

792
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,770
According to my dad's rules,

793
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,670
Party B cannot kiss Party A.

794
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,900
Got it.

795
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,100
No. You don't.

796
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,650
Come here. Let me

797
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,130
tell you a secret.

798
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,720
Why are you so surprised?

799
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,580
According to my dad's rules,

800
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,280
Party B can't kiss Party A.

801
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,370
But there is no rule

802
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,520
saying that A can't kiss Party B.

803
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,840
So,

804
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,830
I can kiss you,

805
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,120
but you can't kiss me.

806
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,510
What?

807
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,040
Well,

808
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,960
can you kiss me more?

809
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,590
I need to think about it at home.

810
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,150
Why at home?

811
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,240
Because we're here.

812
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,750
Go home quickly.

813
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,950
You should go home now.

814
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,000
Go home.

815
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,250
Go home.

816
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,270
Go.

817
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,960
Okay.

818
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,720
Bye.

819
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,510
Bye.

820
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,770
Excuse me, Miss.

821
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,410
Do you live here?

822
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,680
Yes.

823
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,460
I'm looking for

824
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,020
Lane 47, Alley 16

825
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,720
but can't find it.

826
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,820
Lane 47, Alley 16?

827
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,480
Go straight,

828
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,470
past two alleys,

829
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,350
then turn left

830
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,290
at the white sign.

831
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,550
You can see it, right?

832
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,000
Then go straight to the end

833
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,890
and turn right.

834
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,290
You'll see

835
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:28,990
a convenience store.

836
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,250
Go a little further and turn left.

837
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,220
That's it.

838
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,690
Okay.

839
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,020
I'll go straight.

840
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,710
The second alley.

841
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,060
Yes.

842
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,670
Turn left.

843
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,120
-Yes, and keep going.
-Turn left.

844
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,850
Go to the end.

845
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,750
Yes.

846
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,560
-And then...
-Then the convenience store.

847
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,190
How about this?

848
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,320
I'll take you there.

849
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,180
Is it too much trouble for you?

850
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:43,730
No.

851
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,580
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

852
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,900
Keke.

853
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,130
Why are you back?

854
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,610
Who is this?

855
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,270
He needs directions to Lane 47, Alley 16.

856
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,980
I'll take him.

857
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,090
No, I'll take him. Go home.

858
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,800
You take him?

859
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,140
Go home now.

860
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,400
Okay then.

861
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,460
Bye.

862
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,570
Bye.

863
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,220
Bye.

864
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,810
Thank you.

865
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,730
Young man.

866
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,180
Let's go.

867
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,060
What do you want now?

868
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
It's been 12 years

869
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,390
since

870
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,940
we had a proper meal

871
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,790
together.

872
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,600
Strangers don't eat together.

873
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,450
No matter what,

874
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,810
I'm your father.

875
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,810
You have my blood.

876
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,620
That's a fact

877
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,240
you can't change.

878
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,570
Strangers?

879
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,770
Cutting ties?

880
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,070
You made those willful decisions.

881
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,480
I never agreed.

882
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,880
Willful?

883
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,020
When Mom was in the hospital,

884
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,550
you never visited her once.

885
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,250
I felt bad too about your mom's illness.

886
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,180
Did Mom feel good?

887
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,090
Did I?

888
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,060
Let me remind you.

889
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,160
When Mom passed,

890
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,290
you were busy fighting for the estate.

891
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,760
Everything I did

892
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,520
is for your future.

893
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,750
Spare me

894
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,070
the "loving father"

895
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,940
act.

896
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,050
It's

897
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,510
unconvincing.

898
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,250
[Preview]

899
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,320
This is

900
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,350
the money I've saved over the years.

901
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,020
One million?

902
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,320
Your cupcakes were a hit

903
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,140
at the bazaar,

904
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,700
so I'm

905
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:13,390
investing in you

906
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,560
as a shareholder.

907
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,570
To deal with Michael Zhao,

908
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,230
we need to work together.

909
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,610
Let's invite him to a BBQ.

910
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,100
I'll make you fall in love with me.

911
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,250
Since my mom passed away,

912
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,050
no one has cared for me like this.

913
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,000
Keke.

914
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,460
Someone wants to see you.

915
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,200
Aren't you the one who asked for directions that day?

916
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,200
Leave my son.
