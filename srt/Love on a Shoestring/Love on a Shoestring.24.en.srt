[Episode 24]

4
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,920
I can only care about my son secretly.

5
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,060
But even with such deep longing for you,

6
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,380
I still resolutely refuse to admit my mistakes.

7
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,020
Because I always thought

8
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,759
that one day you would understand

9
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,490
my good intentions as a father.

10
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,970
Son.

11
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,400
I was wrong.

12
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,610
My stubbornness as a father

14
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
has made us miss out on so many years.

15
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,590
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,950
I shouldn't have left you alone

17
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,480
with your mother back then.

18
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,139
I didn't notice your unease and sadness.

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,120
I believed that family wealth is the most important protective tool.

21
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,300
But I made you and your mother

22
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,440
have irreparable regrets.

23
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,570
I was wrong.

24
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,340
I was really wrong.

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,370
Haikuo.

26
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,510
You don't need to choose

27
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,070
between me and your mother.

28
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,690
Because you are the motivation and hope

29
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,700
of our lives.

30
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,700
This is a letter your mother left for me.

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,560
She probably had an intuition in her heart.

32
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,690
She knew she wouldn't be able to see me before she passed away.

33
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,350
So she wrote this letter to me.

34
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,340
I thought

35
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,880
she would blame me

36
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,390
and resent me.

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
But in her letter,

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,610
every word

39
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,540
was reminding me,

40
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,329
telling me not to stay up late,

41
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
not to be so busy that I forget to eat,

42
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,090
and not to eat liver foods

43
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,570
because she was afraid my cholesterol would be too high.

44
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,720
She told me to watch my diet.

45
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,410
She was just that good,

46
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,130
always so gentle.

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,170
That's right.

48
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,700
She was the person who treated me

49
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,959
the best in this world.

50
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,070
She loved me.

51
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,310
She forgave me.

52
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,710
She always thought about me in everything she did.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,670
But...

54
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,370
But I didn't go to see her one last time.

55
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,420
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,570
Kid.

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,310
Don't make the same mistakes as I did.

58
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,360
What do you mean?

59
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,840
I know you broke up with Keke.

60
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,030
After you broke up,

61
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,840
Keke came to see me.

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,170
She still defended you,

63
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,350
spoke for you,

64
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,820
and blamed me for you.

65
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,659
So I hope

66
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,440
you won't have the same regrets as me,

67
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,120
losing the person who loves you the most.

68
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm the manager of the Business Department?

69
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,310
Yes.

70
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,030
Ellly's cousin is the HR manager.

71
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,030
He said that.

72
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,050
The HR order will be issued soon.

73
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,760
How is that possible?

74
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,220
How could it be me?

75
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,700
Why?

76
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,470
A big client who is about to sign

77
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,180
a long-term cooperation deal with us.

78
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,320
Their superior specified

79
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,450
that you should be the contact person.

80
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,250
Is the big client you just mentioned

81
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,010
Haikuo's father's company?

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,900
Yes.

83
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,370
Strange.

84
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,420
Why would President Wang specify me?

85
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
Could it be to make up for something?

86
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,110
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,950
Are you trying to harm me secretly?

88
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,550
Keke.

89
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,600
You really keep your word.

90
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,620
President Wang has already agreed to cooperate.

91
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,820
He's ready to sign the contract with us.

92
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,540
Really?

93
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,010
Of course, it's true.

94
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,320
His representative will be here shortly

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,520
to sign the contract.

96
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,610
Keke.

97
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,290
You are really the lucky star of our company.

98
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,870
You are the savior.

99
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,610
Savior.

100
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,960
I don't think I did anything.

101
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,000
I was surprised that they decided to sign the contract.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,080
If it weren't for you,

103
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,810
why would President Wang

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,850
name you

105
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,910
as the representative for signing the contract?

106
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,880
Me as the representative?

107
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,710
I'm not even in the Business Department.

108
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,980
As long as we can sign the contract,

109
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,260
everything's fine.

110
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,330
General Manager, the representative from TV Group is here.

111
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,930
Good, please let them in.

112
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,510
Come in.

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,240
Haikuo?

114
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,530
Hello.

115
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,230
I represent President Wang Changfa of TV Group

116
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,040
to discuss our cooperation.

117
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,190
You represent President Wang to discuss the contract?

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,290
Please, have a seat.

119
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:13,900
Thank you.

120
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,650
Have some tea.

121
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,840
Thank you.

122
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,930
Keke, have a seat.

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,010
Here, have some tea.

124
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,450
But, General Manager,

125
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,560
I'm from the Accounting Department.

126
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,350
I'm really not familiar with the details of the business.

127
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,760
You handle the signing.

128
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,059
For the follow-up,

129
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,030
I'll have Sales Manager Chen Shi of Division One assist you.

130
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,559
Chen Shi is the Sales Manager of Division One?

131
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,350
General Manager, this arrangement

132
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,340
is really great.

133
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,320
Well.

134
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
General Manager.

135
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,660
This means I'll have to do

136
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,520
two jobs,

137
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
but only get paid for one.

138
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,190
If you do two jobs,

139
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,780
well,

140
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,150
of course, you'll get paid for two jobs.

141
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,340
Well...

142
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,110
Here, have some tea.

143
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,840
Thank you.

144
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,730
You all planned this, didn't you?

145
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,380
Brilliant move.

146
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,890
You caught Keke off guard.

147
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,610
Keke must be surprised out of her wits.

148
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,570
More than Keke,

149
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,550
I was also surprised out of my wits.

150
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,300
The workload will increase now.

151
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,170
Keke's work

152
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,860
won't just be shared with you.

153
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,990
Why are you sighing?

154
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,930
But the parts Keke is responsible for

155
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,190
are more complicated.

156
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,490
It's just the Business Department's documents.

157
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,290
I'll help you with the accounts.

158
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,890
But this means

159
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,150
you can't leave work on time.

160
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,610
You have to work overtime.

161
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,950
Overtime is fine.

162
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,110
I can get paid for overtime.

163
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,310
Making more money

164
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,480
can increase our house purchase fund.

165
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,550
Since you represent President Wang's company,

166
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,210
does this mean you've reconciled with your dad?

167
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,280
It's hard to say.

168
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,820
But now we have

169
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
a regular monthly dinner together.

170
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,130
So what's your arrangement with me and Keke

171
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,180
supposed to mean?

172
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,000
Isn't it obvious?

173
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,420
He wants to get back together with Keke.

174
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,220
Manager Chen.

175
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm May from the Planning Department.

176
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,130
This drink is buy one get one free.

177
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,190
Here's one for you.

178
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,190
That's impressive.

179
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,150
You're quite lucky with the ladies.

180
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,950
Someone even bought you a drink.

181
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,070
It looks like Chen Shi

182
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,430
might get into a relationship soon.

183
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,820
Congratulations.

184
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,990
Congratulations.

185
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,250
Yu Fen.

186
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,890
What are you doing?

187
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,020
Mi.

188
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,890
Can you take

189
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,950
three days of annual leave next week?

190
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,150
Sure.

191
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,370
Why?

192
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,050
My parents know we're dating.

193
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,320
So they want me to take you back to Singapore

194
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,270
to meet them.

195
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,990
Okay?

196
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,180
Yu Fen.

197
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,940
My mom said

198
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,740
we shouldn't play with food.

199
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,220
Although we haven't really started making money yet,

200
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,730
we're almost breaking even.

201
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,260
I think in a few more months,

202
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,480
we'll be in the black.

203
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,670
That's pretty soon.

204
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,820
What's wrong?

205
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,700
My mom messaged me.

206
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,590
She said

207
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,370
she wants to meet me tomorrow

208
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,250
to give me the money in person.

209
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,660
Why go to all that trouble?

210
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,460
She could just transfer the money to your account.

211
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,390
Are you going to see her?

212
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,220
You have to run the business.

213
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,150
How do you have time during the day?

214
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,960
I should meet her anyway.

215
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,300
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,400
It's okay.

217
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,880
Yu Fen.

218
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,220
Are you free tonight?

219
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,280
Would you like

220
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,130
to have dinner together?

221
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,850
Manager Chen.

222
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,240
Manager Chen, let me help you pick it up.

223
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,990
No.

224
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,750
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

225
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,920
I dropped it myself.

226
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,680
Yu Fen.

227
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,860
Manager Chen.

228
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,840
Can I have dinner with you tonight?

229
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,700
I just remembered

230
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,920
I have something to do tonight.

231
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,970
I'll leave now.

232
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,980
What about tomorrow?

233
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,910
I'm free tomorrow.

234
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,790
If not tomorrow, the day after is also fine.

235
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,660
Manager Chen.

236
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,840
Jiali.

237
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:54,820
Mom.

238
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,210
This

239
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,490
is to repay the money I owe you.

240
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,810
Aren't you going to count it?

241
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,040
It's okay.

242
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,890
No need.

243
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,420
Is there something we need to meet about?

244
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,550
You should open it and check.

245
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,510
Count it.

246
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,490
Okay.

247
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,890
What's in the paper bag?

248
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,330
I don't know.

249
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,400
But Jiali looks shocked.

250
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,820
Could it be fake money?

251
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,350
Fake money?

252
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,350
No way.

253
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,600
I need to go check.

254
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,860
Grandma, no.

255
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,230
You'll be discovered.

256
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,260
I remember you liked this photo a lot.

257
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,100
I found the negatives.

258
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,190
So I had it printed for you.

259
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,060
Mom.

260
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,960
What's going on now?

261
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,170
I don't know.

262
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,020
Jiali, I'm sorry.

263
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,330
I know I've been selfish.

264
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,200
Can you forgive me?

265
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,030
Can I come visit you often from now on?

266
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,150
Of course.

267
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,580
Look at you. You've grown so much.

268
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,820
It's hard to run a shop now.

269
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,430
Take good care of yourself.

270
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,180
Got it?

271
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,540
You too.

272
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,310
I have something to do later.

273
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,950
I have to go now.

274
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,580
Remember to take your stuff.

275
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,690
Keep in touch.

276
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,650
Keep in touch.

277
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,460
Bye.

278
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,240
Grandma.

279
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,230
Jiali.

280
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,599
What's in there?

281
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,859
Grandma, why are you here?

282
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,530
It's this.

283
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,160
Isn't this your most cherished family photo?

284
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,490
She said she found the negatives.

285
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,370
So she printed one for me.

286
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,810
She also apologized to me just now.

287
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,880
She said she knows she's been selfish.

288
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,410
She hopes I can forgive her.

289
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,990
She also said we should keep in touch.

290
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,380
So,

291
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,750
did you promise her?

292
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,240
After all, she's my mom.

293
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,950
She's just feeling guilty for now.

294
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,890
After a while, she'll disappear again,

295
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,950
with no news at all.

296
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,780
Grandma, it won't happen.

297
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,900
And even if that's true,

298
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,040
I still have you and Keke.

299
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,480
Alright, Grandma, don't be mad.

300
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,270
Okay.

301
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,280
I'm not mad.

302
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,480
Not mad.

303
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,740
So obedient?

304
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,590
Grandma asked you to go to the café, and you went?

305
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,250
Because she's my grandma too.

306
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,150
Listening to Grandma is the right thing to do.

307
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,820
Come on.

308
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,690
I'll take you somewhere.

309
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,860
Do you particularly like any of them?

310
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,650
I...

311
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,520
Excuse me, Miss.

312
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Can I take a look at this?

313
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,910
Okay.

314
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,800
Thank you.

315
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,660
Take your time. Tell me if you like any of them.

316
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,340
Thank you.

317
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,730
Why are you so nervous?

318
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,580
But buying a ring

319
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,180
means what I think it means, right?

320
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,990
What do you mean?

321
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,640
It means

322
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,730
a commitment or something like that.

323
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,650
It can be.

324
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,420
But it also doesn't have to be.

325
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,230
I want to secure you.

326
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,620
I want to be your future wife.

327
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,840
I won't

328
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,490
let you pay for this ring.

329
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,980
I'm willing to pay.

330
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,490
Even if you are willing to pay,

331
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,980
I won't let you.

332
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,290
One must pursue their own happiness.

333
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,420
Even though we've only been together

334
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,380
for a short time,

335
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,520
I clearly know

336
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,600
that you're the one I want to spend my life with.

337
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,910
I know you might not be

338
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,280
thinking about marriage at your age.

339
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,010
But I'm selfishly

340
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,550
wanting to secure you first.

341
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm thinking

342
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,260
that once my mom or I

343
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,200
repay the 500,000 NTD

344
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,450
you lent,

345
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,000
we can get married.

346
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,190
So this ring

347
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,930
will be our token of love.

348
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,090
A symbol of our promise.

349
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,910
Do you want to spend your life with me?

350
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,200
I do.

351
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,350
Even if the money isn't repaid, it's okay.

352
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,010
I want to be with you for life.

353
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,450
Congratulations.

354
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,280
Congratulations to both of you.

355
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,600
They've all been sold out?

356
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,220
Do you have any questions

357
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,680
about the contract terms?

358
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,400
I need to think about it.

359
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,680
And selling them

360
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,790
would greatly increase

361
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,150
our house fund.

362
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,800
What do you think about the progress

363
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,400
of the cooperation project?

364
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,480
I need to think about this too.

365
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,420
If you're free tonight,

366
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,520
we can meet up

367
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,400
to discuss it thoroughly

368
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,690
and have dinner.

369
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,840
It's okay.

370
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,620
If you need more time to think,

371
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,570
I can discuss it with you next time.

372
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,590
A month is a bit too long.

373
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,190
In fact, one night is enough.

374
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,510
The power of love is amazing.

375
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,330
You've been

376
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,020
avoiding me lately.

377
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,070
Yeah.

378
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,270
I don't want to become the enemy of all women.

379
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,900
Right now, you're the golden bachelor

380
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,160
in the eyes of every woman in the company.

381
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,830
Your future is limitless.

382
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,250
Since I'm so popular,

383
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,960
why are you avoiding me?

384
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,490
You don't like me?

385
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,020
You're out of my league now.

386
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,810
Let go!

387
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,450
When we all went out before,

388
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,970
did you

389
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,510
have feelings for me?

390
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,060
There are people here.

391
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't talk about this.

392
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,250
We haven't finished our work yet.

393
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,130
Let's go back to the office first.

394
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,410
But they...

395
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,850
Let them deal with their own business.

396
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,520
Even if I had feelings for you,

397
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,540
I know my place.

398
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,890
I won't bother you

399
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,280
or cause you trouble.

400
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,900
But...

401
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,240
I don't feel troubled at all.

402
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,810
Yu Fen.

403
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,470
I like you.

404
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,360
Would you be my girlfriend?

405
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,780
She doesn't give me any chances.

406
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,470
Except for work invitations,

407
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,250
she rejects everything else.

408
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,680
Could it be that her feelings for you

409
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,460
have faded?

410
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,750
That's unlikely.

411
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,630
I think that

412
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,720
she still likes me,

413
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,870
I remember you told me

414
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,420
Keke loves her parents very much.

415
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,070
Maybe

416
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,970
you can start from there.

417
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,580
I've already tried that.

418
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,190
Keke

419
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,350
is very independent.

420
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,160
We can't persuade her

421
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,090
on many things.

422
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,070
You want to invite Keke to dinner?

423
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,160
Then all these groceries I bought will go to waste.

424
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,090
They'll spoil if they sit too long.

425
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,930
And

426
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,280
I can't invite you to our house for dinner.

427
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,140
You two broke up.

428
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,020
It would be awkward.

429
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,420
Their defenses are strong.

430
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,680
Any other

431
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,790
suggestions?

432
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,490
Looks like you'll have to play the long game.

433
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,070
He even helped me carry the groceries home.

434
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,740
I deliberately

435
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,020
bought a week's groceries.

436
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,570
Do you know how heavy it is?

437
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,670
Look.

438
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,600
I didn't even really help him.

439
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
But he still left the fruits behind,

440
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,910
showing how generous he is.

441
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,870
Alright,

442
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,140
stop defending him.

443
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,750
So what if we do?

444
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,850
He and his dad have made up.

445
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,300
You two get along fine.

446
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,810
I don't know what you're holding on to.

447
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,590
Are you worried that

448
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,840
their reconciliation won't last?

449
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,950
Yes.

450
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,760
I think if I drag this out,

451
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,070
they'll have more time to get along.

452
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,930
After so long without seeing each other,

453
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,840
they need time to adjust.

454
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,990
But isn't it bad

455
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,650
to keep him hanging like this?

456
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,380
That's true.

457
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,270
but I've been

458
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,750
holding this high ground for so long,

459
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,350
I don't know how to back down.

460
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,390
No way out now.

461
00:28:59,130 --> 00:28:59,590
Mi.

462
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,040
It's not even 9:30,

463
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,580
going to bed so early?

464
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,220
Mi.

465
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,210
I know

466
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,670
I'm not the first person you've liked.

467
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,740
But I hope

468
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,130
in the future,

469
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,920
when you are in pain,

470
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,690
I'll be the first person

471
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,100
you think of to confide in.

472
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,730
When you're happy,

473
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,760
I'll be the first person

474
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,620
you want to share it with.

475
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,840
When you're frustrated,

476
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,580
I hope

477
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,850
I'll be the first person

478
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,110
you think of to rely on.

479
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,050
I also hope

480
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,950
I'll be the first

481
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,750
and only person

482
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,960
you want to spend your life with.

483
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,740
I know I'm ordinary.

484
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,350
I don't have money.

485
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,580
I know

486
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,700
our future life

487
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,810
will be just about everyday needs.

488
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,570
But rest assured.

489
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,070
When you are hungry,

490
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,570
I'll be your food.

491
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,850
When you are thirsty,

492
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,180
I'll be your tea.

493
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,310
When you are angry,

494
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,400
I'll be your punching bag.

495
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,270
Dear,

496
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,240
will you marry me?

497
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,360
I will.

498
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,350
I will.

499
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,240
You proposed to Elly?

500
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,530
You two are progressing

501
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,300
really fast.

502
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,110
Isn't it sincere?

503
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,990
I think

504
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,980
it's a bit inappropriate.

505
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,630
What's inappropriate about it?

506
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,820
Next week,

507
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,790
you're going to Singapore with Elly

508
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,920
to meet her parents for the first time.

509
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,210
And you're meeting them

510
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,980
with wedding invitations?

511
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,100
Is it appropriate?

512
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,260
Right.

513
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,390
Getting married without her parents' consent,

514
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,860
and handing out wedding invitations at the first meeting,

515
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,220
it seems

516
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,370
pretty frivolous.

517
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,390
[5,000 KG]

518
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,050
To fathers,

519
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,290
their daughters are treasures to them.

520
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,610
He might dislike you

521
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,300
for taking his daughter away.

522
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,490
A frivolous man.

523
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,889
I heard that

524
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,770
you have dinner with your dad every month.

525
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,020
I recommend this restaurant. It's very good.

526
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,820
Let's go together this weekend.

527
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,190
The braised beef brisket here

528
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,020
is the best I've ever had.

529
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,090
So today, I invited you two

530
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,500
to try it personally.

531
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,300
Mr. Jian, you're an elder.

532
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,370
It's not right for an elder to pay for dinner.

533
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,170
Let me treat you.

534
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,170
That's right. Let the kid pay.

535
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,790
You just order the food.

536
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:46,920
Really?

537
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,090
Well...

538
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,610
Thank you.

539
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,190
Aren't you going to order?

540
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,960
Here's the thing.

541
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,030
I invited you two here today

542
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,920
mainly to discuss

543
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,340
something about Keke.

544
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,210
Keke told me

545
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,170
that Haikuo

546
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
had started pursuing her again.

547
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,040
Yes.

548
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,820
I really like Keke.

549
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,540
So,

550
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,470
I'm still pursuing her.

551
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,770
That's right.

552
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,580
Great.

553
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,500
Let me tell you.

554
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,190
From what I know about Keke,

555
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,480
just go straight to our house

556
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,550
and propose.

557
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,620
Isn't that too soon?

558
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,570
Of course not.

559
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,060
Of course not.

560
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,390
But I don't want to pressure Keke too much.

561
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,020
I'm afraid she'll be unhappy.

562
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,730
She won't.

563
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,790
Why would she be unhappy?

564
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,760
She won't be unhappy.

565
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,320
She won't be unhappy.

566
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,440
But Mr. Jian, didn't you say

567
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,050
Keke has a strong will of her own

568
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,690
and she's not easily influenced?

569
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,710
I...

570
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,680
Did I say that?

571
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,400
Yes.

572
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,930
Haikuo told me

573
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,370
Keke has been rejecting his invitations lately.

574
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,830
I think we shouldn't rush.

575
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,770
Don't rush?

576
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,450
Then...

577
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,400
Well...

578
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,440
How slow will you go?

579
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:27,990
Maybe

580
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,010
a year.

581
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,080
A year?

582
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,410
Well...

583
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,190
Isn't a year too short?

584
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,540
Then...

585
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,760
Then two years.

586
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,770
Okay.

587
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,320
Wang Haikuo.

588
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,450
You don't really expect me to wait two years, do you?

589
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,550
Do you know how long two years is?

590
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,280
Two years...

591
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,660
Two years...

592
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,820
You can have two children in two years.

593
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,080
Right.

594
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,270
You...

595
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,270
Why are you here?

596
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,210
[Dear Wife]

597
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,210
Let me tell you.

598
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,910
The braised beef brisket here

599
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,770
is the best I've ever had.

600
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,530
So I invited you two here...

601
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,530
We've been in the next room the whole time.

602
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,730
We heard everything

603
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,960
you said.

604
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,290
I told you

605
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,120
my daughter

606
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,760
is in a hurry.

607
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,070
Yes.

608
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,010
Isn't it

609
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,670
too fast?

610
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,760
If you think it's too fast,

611
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,730
then I'll leave.

612
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,550
No.

613
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,090
No matter what,

614
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,510
I just want you to know

615
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,310
because it's you,

616
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,580
even if

617
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,370
it's ten years, twenty years,

618
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,350
or even

619
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,900
thirty years,

620
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,330
I'm willing.

621
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,430
In this lifetime,

622
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,410
I'll only love you.

623
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,560
Young man,

624
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,460
you haven't even proposed,

625
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
and you want to kiss my girl already?

626
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,650
Let's eat.

627
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,940
The food's getting cold.

628
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,110
Okay.

629
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:07,840
Let's eat.

630
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,180
Baby,

631
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,090
let's leave the engagement ring

632
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,920
at home.

633
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,450
I'm afraid it might get lost on the plane.

634
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,230
Don't worry.

635
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,440
I won't lose it.

636
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,790
I will guard it with my life.

637
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,530
By the way,

638
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,200
about our engagement,

639
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,520
I think it's better not to mention it yet.

640
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,900
Why?

641
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,060
I'm afraid it might be too much for your parents.

642
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,830
After all,

643
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,230
I haven't met them yet.

644
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,480
Telling them about the engagement

645
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,260
the first time we meet

646
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,660
might be a bit

647
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,330
too...

648
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,660
Too abrupt?

649
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,580
Why would it be?

650
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,260
Are you afraid my dad won't agree?

651
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,120
Considering how much your dad loves you,

652
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,620
I'm worried he might dislike me.

653
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,870
Don't worry.

654
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,490
They will think

655
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,150
you are very responsible.

656
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,220
Responsible?

657
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,910
What do you mean?

658
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,380
I...

659
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,460
My period is late.

660
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,080
I went to the clinic for a check-up and...

661
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,490
What's wrong with your period?

662
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,420
Why did you need to go to the clinic?

663
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,180
[Ob-GYN Clinic Diagnostic Report]

664
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,010
Well?

665
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,450
Happy?

666
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,600
Surprised?

667
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,240
We're having a baby!

668
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,920
We're having a baby!

669
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,470
We're having a baby!

670
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,940
So don't worry.

671
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,690
I think my parents

672
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,520
will support us being together.

673
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,130
Okay.

674
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,580
Wait a moment.

675
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,750
I need to make a call.

676
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,790
Who are you calling?

677
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,160
My insurance agent.

678
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,030
I need to increase my accidental death and dismemberment coverage.

679
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,690
I think your dad might kill me.

680
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,720
No, he won't.

681
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,080
-He will.
- No, don't call.

682
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,550
Peng, I have a question.

683
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,150
Well,

684
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,850
what's the maximum payout

685
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,810
for disability?

686
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:27,990
Yes.

687
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,880
And what about a broken leg?

688
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,940
We chose today to propose

689
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,670
after careful consideration.

690
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,260
The date is propitious,

691
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,730
blessing the future couple with happiness.

692
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,990
Thank you.

693
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,470
We can also

694
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,060
discuss the dowry today.

695
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,790
Yes.

696
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,700
In-law,

697
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,060
please don't be modest,

698
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,270
if you have any requests,

699
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,400
feel free to mention them.

700
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,510
We'll

701
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,720
fully cooperate.

702
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,280
Here's the thing.

703
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,850
We don't want anything.

704
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,800
Nothing.

705
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,590
I only have one small request,

706
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,790
which is that

707
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,710
they must not

708
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,580
have any intimate relations

709
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,510
before the wedding.

710
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,930
What did you say?

711
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,430
When we were...

712
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,560
Well...

713
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,490
No problem, Mr. Jian.

714
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,620
I've kept your rules

715
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,160
very well until now.

716
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,160
Good job.

717
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,920
Fine.

718
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,020
Here they come.

719
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,400
You're so beautiful.

720
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,670
Thank you.

721
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,370
You're welcome.

722
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,910
Haikuo.

723
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,190
Haikuo!

724
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,620
Haikuo!

725
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,420
Haikuo.

726
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,130
Quick, have Keke come over and sit.

727
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,130
Let's start discussing

728
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,960
the wedding ceremony details.

729
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,360
Okay.

730
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,250
Okay about what?

731
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,480
We don't have

732
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,640
any opinions

733
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,100
as long as they are happy.

734
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,400
Yes.

735
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,090
I go with whatever Keke wants.

736
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,130
I don't have any opinions either.

737
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,510
But

738
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,870
the red envelopes and restaurant should balance out,

739
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,030
so we can break even.

740
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,070
And don't spend too much on the decorations.

741
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,410
Silly girl.

742
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,670
A wedding happens only once in a lifetime.

743
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,670
It's not our money.

744
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,570
It's theirs.

745
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,870
What are you saving for?

746
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,530
Mom.

747
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,770
They can hear you, you know?

748
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,270
Even I heard everything.

749
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,150
No problem.

750
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,650
Keke.

751
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,770
Don't worry

752
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,230
about the money, okay?

753
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,270
No.

754
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,140
Even for a wedding, we need to save money.

755
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,350
That's my principle.

756
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,170
Alright, we'll do as you say.

757
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,810
-Okay.
-Now the details are finalized,

758
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,030
Let's take a group photo.

759
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,990
-Okay.
-I'll help take the photo.

760
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,840
Okay.

761
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,970
Okay.

762
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,450
Everyone, look here.

763
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,130
-Here.
