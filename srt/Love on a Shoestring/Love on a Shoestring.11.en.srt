[Episode 11]

5
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,420
Are you willing to join?

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,840
Are you...

7
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,190
Are you asking me?

8
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,900
Yes, I'm asking you.

9
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,250
Considering how good-looking we are,

10
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,450
we can definitely

11
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,240
make this journey unforgettable.

12
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,759
With us,

13
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,690
the scenery along the way

14
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,710
will be more beautiful.

15
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,300
We can stay away from the city.

16
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,560
The wind,

17
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,100
sunlight,

18
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,640
and air in nature

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,540
will help

20
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,110
relax our skin.

21
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,260
You're right.

22
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,110
But...

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,050
I'm in a dilemma.

24
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,900
No need for that.

25
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:35,020
Don't you want to enjoy

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,790
a hot spring experience that can beautify our skin

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,610
and eat delicious food with much collagen with me

28
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,640
in a forest full of phytoncide?

29
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,200
Oh my God.

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,100
I'll look five years younger.

31
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,710
Then...

32
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,230
Okay.

33
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,850
I'll go.

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,090
I'll go.

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,730
He's Haikuo, right?

36
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,540
Haikuo.

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,480
Yes, he's Haikuo.

38
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,570
No.

39
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,900
Why do I think

40
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,570
he's like Michael Zhao?

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
I also think so.

42
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,250
Do you think

43
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,400
he has been influenced by Michael Zhao

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,030
or possessed by him?

45
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,600
Then...

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
see you this weekend.

47
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,070
Bye bye.

48
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,200
Thank you so much.

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
Thanks to your help,

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,830
Elly agreed to travel with us.

51
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,840
It was thanks to Mr. Wang.

52
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,410
It's no big deal.

53
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,480
If I hadn't seen your rehearsal before,

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,410
I really couldn't have said a word.

55
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,110
Considering how good-looking we are,

56
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,240
we can definitely

57
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,300
make this journey unforgettable.

58
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,430
With us,

59
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,970
the scenery along the way will be more beautiful.

60
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,100
We can not only

61
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,900
relax our bodies by traveling.

62
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,040
The wind

63
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,940
and sunlight in nature

64
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,600
and staying away from the city

65
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,860
can also

66
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,560
help relax our skin.

67
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,080
In terms of confidence and acting skills,

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,830
I can only

69
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,330
salute you.

70
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,790
It's weird.

71
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,970
Why does Elly

72
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,770
treat you and me so differently?

73
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,150
What makes Elly hate me?

74
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,300
Don't think too much.

75
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,640
During this trip,

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,700
let's try our best to find the answer.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,110
Why do women like you so much?

78
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,000
Is it because I haven't done enough in skincare?

79
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,510
Can you not be so close to me?

80
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,640
I can hardly see you.

81
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,230
Okay.

82
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,880
Could it be that she finds it hard to disclose the reason?

83
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,890
Or does she have a secret?

84
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,270
Anyway,

85
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,710
she has agreed to go with us.

86
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,170
We'll try our best to find the answer for you.

87
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,870
Okay.

88
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,610
I'm here.

89
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,790
Yuanchong, I'm sorry

90
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,500
for making you work for an extra hour.

91
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,930
It's okay. I'm willing.

92
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,690
Okay. You can get changed and go home.

93
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,290
Thank you.

94
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,159
Jiali,

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,570
I'm off work.

96
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,420
Thank you. Bye bye.

97
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,240
Bye bye.

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,620
Jiali,

99
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,640
you're saving money, right?

100
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,810
We're having a promotion

101
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,120
for some collections.

102
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,820
Many products are 35% off.

103
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,740
Do you want to buy some

104
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,270
as breakfast for tomorrow?

105
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,690
I think I do.

106
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,970
I'm going to pick some.

107
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,040
Okay, over there.

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,100
Over there.

109
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,860
Pick some yourself.

110
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,530
Qianqian.

111
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,320
You waited an hour for Yuanchong

112
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,610
to get off work.

113
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,980
Aren't you unhappy?

114
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,260
I'm not unhappy.

115
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,200
He was covering your shift, right?

116
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,240
Well, Yuanchong works here.

117
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,580
Many people said he's very cold

118
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,440
and it's not easy to get along with him.

119
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
What do you think?

120
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,010
Yuanchong is not cold.

121
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,960
He's just aloof from the world.

122
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,130
He just doesn't care about the outside world.

123
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,310
But after spending time with him,

124
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,000
you'll find

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,600
he's really shy and really cute.

126
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,030
Really cute?

127
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,310
Is he?

128
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,610
After spending time with him,

129
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,970
you'll find there's a new side of him.

130
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,170
It'll make you wonder

131
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,050
how there can be

132
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,810
such a cute boy in this world.

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,700
Let me ask you directly.

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,870
Do you like him?

135
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,170
Why are you asking me this?

136
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,660
Sorry, I...

137
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,860
I asked too directly.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,200
You don't have to answer this question.

139
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,840
No.

140
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,140
It's very obvious.

141
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,470
Why are you even asking?

142
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,210
Be more confident.

143
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,120
Of course

144
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,250
I like him.

145
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,960
Sorry that I kept you waiting.

146
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,330
Actually, you don't have to

147
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,480
commute with me.

148
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a waste of your time.

149
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
It's not a waste.

150
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,130
Waiting for the person I like

151
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,680
is romantic.

152
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,630
The person you like?

153
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,900
Could it be...

154
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,490
I advise you not to be a mistress.

155
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,340
Our manager is a married man.

156
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,480
Yuanchong, you're so cute.

157
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,540
The person I like...

158
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,130
is the person I kissed.

159
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Young people nowadays are so brave.

160
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,940
Look.

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,640
I've been using this to order food these days.

162
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,840
The reward has reached 600 NT dollars.

163
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,600
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

164
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,890
No need for that.

165
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,030
Just use the money

166
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,100
to buy midnight snacks

167
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
for your parents.

168
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,900
Now, a few midnight snacks are enough for him.

169
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,840
He has a small appetite.

170
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,370
Because he has a bland diet.

171
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,640
It must be hard for him to eat like this these days.

172
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,130
He loves delicious food so much.

173
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,300
Not just hard.

174
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,070
It's very painful.

175
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,770
That's why I wanted to buy something

176
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,210
to make him feel better.

177
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,170
It's Haikuo.

178
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,060
Hi, Keke.

179
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,770
I...

180
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,730
called you just now, but you didn't answer it.

181
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,760
Why are you here?

182
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,970
I bought steamed dumplings

183
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,030
as midnight snacks for your parents.

184
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,700
We also bought midnight snacks for them.

185
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,560
I also want to explain.

186
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,010
Explain what?

187
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,680
I...

188
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,570
I asked Elly out today

189
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,640
because Michael Zhao told me

190
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,400
he really wants to participate

191
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,330
in the networking event with Elly.

192
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,010
Why...

193
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,830
are you explaining this to me?

194
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,070
I don't care.

195
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,500
I...

196
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,700
I know you don't care.

197
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,330
It's just my wishful thinking.

198
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,370
It doesn't matter even if you think I'm annoying.

199
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,000
But I still want to tell you

200
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,190
I really care about your feelings and emotions.

201
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,470
So,

202
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,710
I don't want anything

203
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,170
that will make you unhappy

204
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,530
to happen.

205
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,000
Anyway,

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,870
I'm still glad

207
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,070
that I can go on a trip with you tomorrow.

208
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,620
Thank you.

209
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,230
Then... I'm leaving.

210
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,250
You...

211
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,350
go home now.

212
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,560
Bye bye.

213
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,880
Bye bye.

214
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,870
Why didn't you talk to him?

215
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,290
Something happened.

216
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,030
I think I really have fallen in love with Wang Haikuo.

217
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,900
Today is our first day of being together.

218

Order whatever you want.

219
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,510
Anything is fine

as long as I can eat with you.

221
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,730
Me too.

222
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,770
I don't think

223
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,700
street food can cost me much money.

224
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,760
Here comes your food.

225
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,040

The original price is 8,999 NT dollars.

231
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,800
Now it only costs 6,999 NT dollars.

232
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,360
Please enjoy.

233
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,990
The price is 2,000 NT dollars less.

234
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,060
Isn't it cost-effective?

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,290
Isn't this a street vendor?

236
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,770
How come there is haute cuisine like this?

237
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,120
You said...

238
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,870

What's wrong? What happened?

241
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,970
Why were you screaming so loudly?

242
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,210
What's wrong?

243
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,080
No.

244
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,850
My savings can't be less than 100,000 NT dollars.

245
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,510
What?

246

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,660
I thought too much.

250
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,950
It was not true.

251
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,120
My precious daughter,

252
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,470
you screamed so loudly for no reason.

253
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,600
I almost had a heart attack.

254
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,590
I think I'm in love with someone.

255
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,830
What did you say?

256
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,710
You're in love with someone?

257
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,100
Who?

258
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,150
Is it...

260
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,160

W-What Haikuo?

W-What Haikuo?

263
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,610
It'll be too pretentious if you keep pretending.

264
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,330
Haikuo ignored you back then.

265
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,410
It was a blow to you.

266
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,200
I...

267
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,600
It... It wasn't a blow.

268
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,030
It wasn't a blow at all.

269
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,430
How could it be a blow?

270
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,030
It wasn't a blow to me at all.

271
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,910
No?

272
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,800
-No.
-Well…

273
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,670
You said you're in love with someone.

Who is that person?

275
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,690
I was acting like they do in dramas.

276
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,800
Well,

277
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,610
the female lead loved the male lead very much.

278
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,540
The male lead abandoned her.

279
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,370
Then the female lead would be very disappointed.

280
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,600
Just now, I was sitting here and thinking

281
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,170
I could just act like I'm very disappointed.

282
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,100
It was like this.

283
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,480

286
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,990
is to be determined.

287
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,790
I can't change my mind because it's free.

288
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,370

289
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,370
I'll deliver the list to the Business Department

290
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,990
to do a head count today.

291
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,530
The Business Department sent me the schedule.

292
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,970
I'm going to send it to the group chat. Take a look.

293
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,790
Okay.

I can't change my mind.

You should go tell them

298

you're not going.

299
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,170
There are lobsters and Wagyu beef barbecue.

What did you just say?

318
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,900
I said the two-day, one-night event...

319
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,030
I can't believe there is a forest trip.

320
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,340

It's really beautiful.

I managed to resist the temptation of Wagyu beef and lobsters,

336

but I compromised because of Elly.

I already gave her the room card.

It's okay. You keep it.

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,620
You should apply some.

It's scorching.

351
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,520
Otherwise, you'll get sunburned.

352

What's wrong with Keke?

356
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,420
I don't know either.

357
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,540
It feels like she's rejecting me

358
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,200
like she did in the beginning.

359
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,470
Did you do anything to upset her?

360
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,940
I'm sure I didn't.

361
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,170
On the contrary, I slowed down

362
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,770
and showed my care properly.

363
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
I wasn't too anxious either.

364
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,240
Instead, I tried to satisfy her parents.

365
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,800
Is that why

366
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,680
you've pushed Keke further away?

367
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,470
Maybe.

368
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,910
You two haven't forgotten what you promised me, right?

369
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,630
Help me find out

370
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,440
why Elly hates me.

371
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,250
Don't forget it.

372
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
I'm going to Elly.

Did you have a quarrel?

What's there to quarrel about?

377
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,000
Then why do I feel

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
something is wrong between you two?

379
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,750
Why?

380
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,140
He gave me his sunscreen, and I took it.

381
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,080
That's all.

382
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,610
You're right.

383
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,860
So I think

384
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,860
you're the one who's weird.

385
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,440
When they gave us the room cards,

386
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,670
you stood still on purpose

387
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,170
and waited for him to come to you.

388
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,900
When he talked to you,

389
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,660
you didn't look at him

390
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,770
to arouse his curiosity on purpose.

391
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm not you.

392
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,060
I don't have so many purposes.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Then why did you

394
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,070
hold his hand on purpose in the end?

395
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,640
You were clearly trying to create opportunities to make contact.

396
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,900
You're very scheming.

397
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,270
What?

398
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,170
You're speechless?

399
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,940
Listen.

400
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,170
I know very well about the flirting tricks

401
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,610
between men and women.

402
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,040
You can't hide it from me.

403
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,850
But Miss,

404
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,930
it's just a fast trip.

405
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,590
Don't you think you've brought too many things?

406
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,020
These are not too many.

407
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,530
You call these "not too many"?

408
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,040
I really forgot to bring...

409
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,800
I forgot to bring...

410
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,580
What did you forget to bring?

411
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,520
I...

412
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,940
I really didn't bring it.

413
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,100
Well, what's the thing that you didn't bring?

414
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,810
Do you want me to help you find it or buy it downstairs?

415
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,760
I didn't bring my eyeshade!

416
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,770
My eyeshade!

417
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,010
Eyeshade?

418
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,140
This is not okay.

419
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,570
I... I need to go home.

420
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,010
Is it that serious?

421
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,830
You don't understand.

422
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,750
I finally found you.

423
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,250
Luckily, I've brought it.

424
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,070
It's just an eyeshade.

425
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,000
Did she have to make such a big fuss?

426
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,130
You specially asked me out

427
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,360
just in order to consult me

428
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,960
about how to reject a girl who likes you?

429
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,870
Manager,

430
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,600
you also know that Qianqian likes me.

431
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,800
But the woman I like

432
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,030
is Jiali.

433
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,130
What on earth should I do?

434
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,360
I can't believe that you're asking me a question like this.

435
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,090
Manager,

436
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,600
please help me.

437
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,630
Because Qianqian is a straightforward girl.

438
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,270
If she doesn't achieve her purpose,

439
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,930
she will never give up easily.

440
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,040
But I can't let Jiali think that

441
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,970
I'm in love with two women.

442
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,210
What on earth should I do?

443
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,120
Being in love with two women?

444
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,410
You're really asking the right person.

445
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,750
Manager.

446
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
But as far as I know, you're not

447
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,070
that kind of man who is a womanizer.

448
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,910
You're right.

449
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,150
I'm not a womanizer.

450
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,540
But I didn't reject those who showed their love for me.

451
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,080
Alright.

452
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,900
Let me tell you

453
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,210
a bloody example.

454
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,930
The second cup of coffee costs just half of the price.

455
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,530
Do you want one more cup of it?

456
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,830
Do you want some coffee?

457
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,930
The second cup of coffee costs just half of the price.

458
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,990
Sir, your coffee is ready.

459
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,020
Just like that,

460
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,870
as the second cup of coffee cost just half of the price.

461
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,730
these two people became a couple.

462
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,830
From then on,

463
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,240
they often came to the store for a date.

464
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,470
Every time, they always bought

465
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,230
those products which had a 60% discount on the second piece,

466
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,230
and used it as a way to

467
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,900
embody the wish that their love

468
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,160
would be as hot-selling as them forever.

469
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,780
Until one day,

470
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,960
the sales event in the store

471
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,690
was no longer limited to a discount on the second piece of a product.

472
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,190
I'm sorry, but it's still not enough.

473
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,620
It's still not enough?

474
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,200
Instead, the store launched

475
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,600
the event of accumulating points to exchange them for gifts.

476
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,120
I'll give my points to you.

477
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,030
Thank you.

478
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,950
In that case,

479
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,360
in order to be with that girl, this man

480
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,070
had no choice but to ask

481
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,500
his girlfriend out and break up with her.

482
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,450
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,200
You're a good girl.

484
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,750
But...

485
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,830
But I don't deserve you.

486
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,530
You want to break up with me?

487
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,670
My mom doesn't allow us to be together.

488
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,010
It's okay. I can go tell your mom that

489
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,470
I love you very much.

490
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,440
No.

491
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,300
There's no future between us.

492
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,500
Because

493
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,570
I've accumulated enough points

494
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,820
and got a gift.

495
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,000
Honey.

496
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,100
[The End]

497
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,350
Manager.

498
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,180
So the bloody example

499
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,440
you mentioned just now

500
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,180
is your personal experience?

501
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,090
Yuanchong.

502
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,550
I'm giving you guidance with my own pain.

503
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,120
I hope you can cherish it well.

504
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,300
Cherish it well.

505
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,730
Make good use of it.

506
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,110
I will, Manager.

507
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,520
I'll make good use of your pain

508
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,290
to solve the choice question about my happiness.

509
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,000
If you wear something like that,

510
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,340
will you be out of breath while you're riding a bike later?

511
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm already out of breath now.

512
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,260
But it's okay.

513
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,140
In my opinion, the prevention of sunburn is more important than my life.

514
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,070
Men

515
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,390
will only look manly with healthy wheat-colored skin.

516
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,040
Okay?

517
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,450
You're wrong.

518
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,470
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays

519
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,900
will only make your skin get wrinkles,

520
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,740
and it'll also increase the risk of skin cancer

521
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,220
and cataracts.

522
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,260
Understand?

523
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,670
A proper amount of sunshine

524
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,600
is good for your body to produce vitamin D.

525
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,340
Okay?

526
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:39,970
Right. Take it off.

527
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,710
Stop nagging.

528
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,430
What are you doing?

529
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,690
-Don't do this!
-Take off your glasses, too.

530
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,450
No way!

531
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,830
There is a special design of anti-cataracts for this pair of glasses.

532
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,870
How afraid are you of ultraviolet rays?

533
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,910
I'm here.

534
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,680
You're wrong again.

535
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,970
The desire to look attractive is not women's exclusive right.

536
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,500
It's important to men, too.

537
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,530
Understand?

538
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,700
Understood.

539
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,530
Okay.

540
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,220
Alright.

541
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,670
Everyone, later,

542
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,640
just ride along this road.

543
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,470
Then you'll reach the entrance of the forest.

544
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,540
We'll gather there.

545
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,110
Okay.

546
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,840
Let's go!

547
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,370
Let's go.

548
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,670
I've noticed that you keep sitting here,

549
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,470
but Haikuo won't come over here.

550
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,830
I didn't ask him to come.

551
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,460
Keke.

552
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,200
There will be many mosquitoes in the forest later.

553
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,300
I've brought a mosquito-repellent spray.

554
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,230
Do you want to spray it on your skin?

555
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,970
It's all right. I don't need it.

556
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,100
Haikuo.

557
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,060
I didn't bring it.

558
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,920
Can you help me spray it on my skin?

559
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,400
You're wrapped like this.

560
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,260
How will the mosquitoes bite you?

561
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,930
That's not necessarily true.

562
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,370
My skin is so delicate.

563
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,460
If insects and mosquitoes just touch me gently,

564
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,610
they might hurt my skin.

565
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,000
You're right.

566
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,040
The mosquitoes in the forest are very poisonous.

567
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,270
Not only have I brought mosquito-repellent sprays,

568
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,240
but I've also brought mosquito-repellent patches.

569
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,040
They're very cute, aren't they?

570
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,170
What's more, these mosquito-repellent patches

571
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,130
have been consecrated in a temple.

572
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,070
They can protect people from not only small black mosquitoes

573
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,170
but also villains.

574
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
Do you want to give it a try?

575
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Just give it a try.

576
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,600
They can protect people from not only small black mosquitoes but also villains.

577
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,510
I don't want them.

578
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,310
-You're so annoying.
-Put it on.

579
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,500
They also have the function of burning fat.

580
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,150
Go away.

581
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,670
Just put it on.

582
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,300
While you're riding the bike,

583
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,660
-it'll also have the function of keeping you safe.
-Go away.

584
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,100
Please.

585
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,060
-It has been consecrated by Mazu.
-I'll count to three.

586
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,720
Three!

587
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,240
Didn't you say that you would count to three?

588
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,170
It really hurts!

589
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,350
Ellie, wait for me! Wait for me!

590
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,590
Jiali, it's good that you came here.

591
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,290
But why did you buy so many things?

592
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,550
It was a waste of money.

593
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,900
Previously, you two didn't feel well,

594
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,410
but I didn't come to take care of you.

595
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,400
Now that Keke is not here this weekend,

596
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,530
I'll accompany you two in place of her.

597
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,670
Uncle Jian, come on.

598
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,330
This is...

599
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,680
Shandong roasted chicken.

600
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,800
It's very delicious. You have to taste it.

601
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,860
I believe that

602
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,050
you came at the right time.

603
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,370
As I ate congee and pickled vegetables every day,

604
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,040
I lost my appetite.

605
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,430
Today, seeing this Shandong roasted chicken,

606
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,960
I have a great appetite now.

607
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,780
Your Uncle Jian

608
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,480
likes to complain.

609
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,050
Jiali.

610
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,940
Are you still working at the convenience store now?

611
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,710
Then are you still looking for a job

612
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,490
in the baking industry?

613
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,410
Yes, I'll submit my resume later,

614
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,010
and then wait for the notice.

615
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,600
Don't worry. Your baking skills are so good,

616
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,340
and the food made by you is so delicious.

617
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,310
You'll definitely find a job in this field.

618
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,100
I think

619
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,870
you can just open your own shop.

620
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,500
Right.

621
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,760
I remember that

622
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,190
previously, you also wanted to

623
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,920
open a shop.

624
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,600
We can invest in your shop.

625
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,100
Our house

626
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,290
can be mortgaged to borrow some money.

627
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,640
No.

628
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,810
Uncle Jian, Auntie,

629
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,310
how can I take your money?

630
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,690
You're like our daughter.

631
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,610
Why are you still making a distinction

632
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,600
between yours and mine?

633
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,770
But I still want to say that

634
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,690
I should gain more experience first.

635
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,490
Otherwise, what if I open a shop in such a hurry that

636
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,190
I fail and lose money?

637
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,000
It won't be like that.

638
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,810
I remember you once told me that

639
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,980
you had developed a dessert,

640
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,070
and after you put it on the shelf in the shop,

641
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,360
it sold well.

642
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,580
That's right.

643
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,370
I also remember that it was very delicious,

644
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,100
and I liked eating it very much.

645
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,030
That's because you two dote on me.

646
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,790
So you always think that everything about me is good.

647
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,330
Then you should be confident about yourself.

648
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,630
How about this?

649
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,640
Our neighborhood is going to hold a bazaar

650
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,590
for the vulnerable groups soon.

651
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,360
By that time, you can set up a stall there,

652
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,430
and consider all the residents and neighbors in the neighborhood here

653
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,160
as your experimental subjects

654
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,910
to see whether your products are very popular.

655
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,660
Good idea!

656
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,360
What if they are unsalable?

657
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,460
It won't be like that.

658
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,600
The food made by you is so delicious.

659
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,940
People will want to eat it again after eating it.

660
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,910
I can

661
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,730
thump my chest and guarantee that

662
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,800
you should have confidence.

663
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,200
I'll help you sign up for the event directly. Okay?

664
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,740
Okay.

665
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,900
Then I'll think about

666
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,570
what desserts I'm going to make.

667
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,310
Okay.

668
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,510
Alright. It's right to think like that.

669
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,460
Just eat.

670
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,660
What are you doing?

671
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,710
This leg is mine,

672
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,830
not yours.

673
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,680
Yours is gone. No.

674
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,970
I know.

675
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,630
I'm going to give it to you.

676
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,860
That's right.

677
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,730
But I don't bear to eat it.

678
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,190
Come on, Jiali. Here you are.

679
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,460
Thank you, Auntie.

680
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,420
You're too thin. Eat more.

681
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,520
Come on.

682
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,540
It's dangerous for us to ride side by side like this.

683
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,179
I think it's okay for just two people.

684
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,409
Haikuo.

685
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,620
Wait for me.

686
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,370
Elly.

687
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,070
My powerful mosquito-repellent patches

688
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,670
can protect people from not only small black mosquitoes

689
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,150
but also villains.

690
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,199
Come on. Let me give them to you.

691
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,000
Put it on now.

692
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,710
Trust me.

693
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,940
I don't want it.

694
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,000
What are you doing?

695
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,000
Where are you guys going?

696
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,929
I haven't found it yet. Wait for me.

697
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,389
Didn't we agree to ride leisurely?

698
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,940
Why are they riding so hard?

699
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,570
You're right.

700
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,630
Why are they suddenly riding so fast?

701
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,820
I... I almost can't ride anymore.

702
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,100
-Come on!
-Come on!

703
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Come on! Do your best to ride!

704
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,930
For the 30-minute distance,

705
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,800
it took us only

706
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,460
12 minutes to finish.

707
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,130
That's good.

708
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,570
We're efficient.

709
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,580
Oh, my God.

710
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,730
-Thank you.
-I can't lift my feet.

711
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,870
Thank you.

712
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,960
Take a rest.

713
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,460
Drink some water to hydrate your body.

714
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,640
How come you don't look tired?

715
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,740
I'm fine. I often ride a bike.

716
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,000
Keke.

717
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,520
Chen Shi told us to gather at the entrance.

718
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,870
I know.

719
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,740
But I think it'll still take them

720
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,200
15 or 20 minutes to arrive.

721
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,360
I want to go in first to take a walk.

722
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,330
No, it's too dangerous for you to go alone.

723
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,760
It's fine.

724
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,040
How about...

725
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,840
Elly.

726
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,500
No.

727
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,770
My feet are shaking.

728
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,670
Michael Zhao.

729
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,730
Don't look at me.

730
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Do I look like I can continue to walk?

731
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,760
Then I'll go in by myself first.

732
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,070
I'll go with you.

733
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,000
She tried to attract Haikuo's attention again.

734
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,980
They're gone.

735
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,560
We're left alone here.

736
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,680
So what?

737
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,560
I'm thinking

738
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,450
we can...

739
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,660
I think we can take this opportunity

740
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,360
to have a deep communication.

741
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
You're sweating.

742
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,200
Don't be nervous.

743
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,620
I have a way

744
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,930
to make you cool down

745
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,120
right away.

746
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,000
These are high-class cool-feeling wet tissues.

747
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,240
As soon as you wipe your skin with it, the apparent temperature of your body

748
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,040
will decrease by three degrees.

749
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,390
It's a good necessity for a home trip in summer.

750
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,870
What do you think? Wipe the back of your head with it.

751
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,730
It's very cool.

752
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,850
It's even making my heart feel cool.

753
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,730
It's super cool.

754
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,390
I have a question.

755
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,710
What is it?

756
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,280
Why did you only

757
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,570
invite Elly and Michael Zhao just now,

758
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,630
instead of asking me to come with you?

759
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,730
But I didn't say no to you when you asked to come with me.

760
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,040
That's right.

761
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,100
He's not talking now.

762
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,560
That's it?

763
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,140
Is he really angry?

764
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,470
He really isn't talking now.

765
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,130
He's serious.

766
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,100
Why are you looking at me?

767
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,570
Because you're looking at me.

768
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,040
If you're not looking at me,

769
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,900
how do you know I'm looking at you?

770
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,230
Yes, I'm looking at you.

771
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,770
Because

772
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,550
when you're bathing in the sunshine,

773
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,030
you look the same as a fairy in the forest.

774
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,070
What are you talking about?

775
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,240
I mean,

776
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,280
you are really beautiful.

777
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,710
Just take one step.

778
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,140
If we're 10,000 steps away from each other,

779
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,160
as long as you take one step,

780
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,160
just leave the remaining 9,999 steps

781
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,110
to me.

782
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,540
What was I talking about?

783
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,150
What does "a fairy in the forest" mean?

784
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,860
Why are you squatting here?

785
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,470
Where are Keke and Haikuo?

786
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,560
They went into the forest.

787
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,130
What is Mr. Zhao doing here?

788
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,990
What happened between you and Elly?

789
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,990
I don't know.

790
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,170
She was happy last second.

791
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,620
But after I gave her a cool-feeling wet tissue,

792
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,130
in the next second,

793
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,640
she was so angry that she asked me to leave the surface of the earth.

794
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,440
That's what happened in the end.

795
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,470
A woman's heart is as mysterious as a needle at the bottom of the ocean.

796
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,240
Hello.

797
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,470
Hi.

798
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,100
I'm sorry.

799
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,160
Even you want to bully me, too. Right?

800
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,600
This is it.

801
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,900
There is a myth

802
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,110
about this forest.

803
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,530
What myth is it?

804
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,200
This is called Love Forest.

805
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,320
I've heard that

806
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,580
after single men and women take a round inside,

807
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,740
[Love Forest]

808
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,590
they'll probably find

809
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,150
their own happiness.

810
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,130
I was too careless.

811
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,850
I actually let them go into

812
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,180
the forest alone first.

813
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,860
Elly, you didn't wait for us.

814
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,130
She ran so fast.

815
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,270
Let me tell you.

816
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,440
Just listen to it, but don't take it seriously.

817
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,840
This is just a marketing method used by merchants

818
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,570
to create a topic.

819
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,970
Don't say it with such absolute certainty.

820
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,010
According to the introduction in this travel guidebook,

821
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,140
this forest

822
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,830
has successfully created

823
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,960
over 100 couples.

824
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,510
Fine. Since you believe so,

825
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,740
why don't you give it a try and take a few more rounds later?

826
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:16,900
Be careful!

827
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,110
Are you okay?

828
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,900
Why are you staring at each other?

829
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,300
I'm fine.

830
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,190
It's good that you're fine.

831
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:10,930
[Preview]

832
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,870
Every time I look at her,

833
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,090
I can't take my eyes off her.

834
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,470
When did your symptoms start?

835
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,640
When we were

836
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,300
at the entrance of the forest.

837
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,500
You're jealous.

838
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,600
You've fallen in love with me.

839
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,040
But my future is Jiali.

840
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,200
I just want to ask her a question.

841
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,600
Do you like Li Yuanchong?

842
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,340
Help me ask Elly to go to the Love Forest to have a date.

843
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,910
It must be the magic of this Love Forest.

844
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,440
Single men and women can get love

845
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,310
in this forest.

846
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,340
Not only do I want a wet-body show,

847
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,640
but I also want

848
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,930
a loss-of-virginity show.
