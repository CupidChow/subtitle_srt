[Episode 9]

4
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,470
What is this?

5
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,539
My luggage.

6
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,930
I know.

7
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm asking

8
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,759
why your luggage is in my house.

9
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,880
Because I'm going to live here.

10
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,020
You're going to live here too?

11
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,950
Of course.

12
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,240
I'm going to live here to take care of Haikuo

13
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,640
until he fully recovers.

14
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,220
Look.

15
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,590
This hair dryer

16
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,509
is very small and easy to carry.

17
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,280
It's been very popular recently.

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,880
Also, its airflow is strong.

19
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,310
And this power bank.

20
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,960
I always take it with me when I go out.

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,830
Because it has

22
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,210
a mirror.

23
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,590
Try it.

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,480
This is really nice.

25
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,180
Honey.

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,960
Since

27
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,730
we had Keke,

28
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,480
the two of us

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,350
haven't had a meal alone

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,870
for a long time.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,079
That's right.

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,579
Keke is not home right now.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm not very used to it.

34
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,579
Honey.

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,510
I bought oysters.

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,310
Eat as many as you can.

37
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,750
Oysters are expensive.

38
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,480
We finally have a chance.

39
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,260
The oysters are delicious.

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,600
But Keke can't eat them because she's not home.

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,579
What a pity.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,160
She's a girl. She doesn't need to eat oysters.

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,670
I specially bought oysters

44
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,420
for you.

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,210
Keke hasn't come home for two days.

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,210
I miss her so much.

47
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,100
I miss her so much

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,579
that I don't think the oysters are delicious

49
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,770
or the dishes are tasty.

50
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,390
I have no appetite at all.

51
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,420
I prepared

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,230
a hearty meal for you,

53
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,380
including oysters.

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,360
I also prepared candles.

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,470
I look like an opera performer because of the heavy makeup.

56
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,840
But what did you just say?

57
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,090
The oysters are not delicious.

58
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,200
The dishes are not tasty.

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,400
You have no appetite at all.

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,180
I've been with you...

61
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,370
I've been with you for 30 years.

62
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,820
What? Now you think the dishes cooked by me taste bad?

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,660
No.

64
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,510
No, don't be angry.

65
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,650
That's not what I mean.

66
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,620
Delicious.

67
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,890
Honey, everything cooked by you is delicious.

68
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,579
I'm going to eat them.

69
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,780
I'm going to eat them.

70
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,020
All of these are delicious.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,200
Tasty.

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,780
Are you really going to sleep without removing your makeup?

73
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,950
Except myself,

74
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,579
I will never let anyone

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,899
see me without makeup,

76
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,880
including my family.

77
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,550
Don't you feel uncomfortable like this?

78
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,350
Besides, it's bad for your skin.

79
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,720
Women have boundless capabilities, like the vastness of oceans.

80
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,970
Good night.

81
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,380
I got you.

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,880
I...

83
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,030
I just want

84
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,780
to go to the toilet.

85
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,370
So much money.

86
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,010
What?

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,510
Go sleep in the living room.

88
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,040
I want to sleep with Haikuo.

89
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,610
It's okay. I can sleep here.

90
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,290
You're okay,

91
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,810
but I'm not okay.

92
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,180
Go sleep in the living room.

93
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,810
Go.

94
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,350
Go.

95
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:50,830
Go.

96
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,270
Did you sleep well?

97
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,140
Of course I slept well

98
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,700
with you holding me.

99
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,380
This is Haikuo's chest.

100
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,080
He's holding me tight.

101
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,450
He smells so manly.

102
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Michael Zhao?

103
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,930
Why are you here?

104
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,330
It's not the time yet. Continue to sleep.

105
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,560
I don't care.

106
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,490
Why are you sleeping here?

107
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,220
Where is Haikuo?

108
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,190
Don't move.

109
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,910
It's early in the morning.

110
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,560
You don't want to sleep, but I do.

111
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,950
It's very important

112
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,110
to have eight-hour beauty sleep.

113
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,840
Understand?

114
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,420
Now, stop making noise.

115
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,890
Just sleep, okay?

116
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,960
Why...

117
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,310
are you looking at me like this?

118
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,770
What's wrong with me?

119
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,700
Why did I fall for him?

120
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,840
Jiali.

121
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,510
Jiali.

122
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,350
What... What do you want again?

123
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,140
Jiali.

124
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,110
My... My mom suddenly...

125
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,310
suddenly got hospitalized.

126
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,390
Can you help me?

127
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,930
What's wrong with your mother?

128
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,430
I don't know.

129
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,940
When I arrived at the hospital,

130
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,690
she was being taken into the operating room.

131
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,960
Now I need to handle the hospital admission procedures.

132
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,830
But...

133
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,400
But I have no money.

134
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,790
No one is willing to lend me money.

135
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,490
Can you help me?

136
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,260
-Okay.
-Please.

137
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,390
Calm down.

138
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,870
How much do you need? I'll transfer it to you.

139
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,210
The...

140
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,150
The hospital didn't tell me.

141
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
Can... Can you...

142
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,420
Can you go to the hospital with me first?

143
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,630
Please.

144
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,500
Please.

145
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,050
Please help me just this once.

146
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,850
Okay, I'm going to call Manager.

147
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,170
Thank you.

148
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,660
So yesterday, Elly and Michael Zhao

149
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,890
slept on the same bed?

150
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,810
Yes.

151
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,120
Yesterday, Elly suddenly came to my bed

152
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,580
in the middle of the night.

153
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,590
So I...

154
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,340
You're awake.

155
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,870
Go sleep in my room. Sleeping on the sofa is uncomfortable.

156
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,790
Okay.

157
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,260
I didn't expect Michael Zhao

158
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,360
to be so obedient after he fell asleep.

159
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,760
It was not like him at all.

160
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,290
So cute.

161
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,740
Cute?

162
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,760
Yes.

163
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,770
Why?

164
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,370
Gap moe.

165
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,440
Isn't he cute?

166
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,710
Gap moe?

167
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,610
Jiali.

168
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,800
Hello, Jiali.

169
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,490
Hello?

170
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,500
Hello?

171
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,580
Hello?

172
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,920
Why can't I hear anything?

173
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,500
Is my cellphone broken?

174
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,360
Let go of me!

175
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,940
Why did you lie to me that your mom has been hospitalized?

176
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,680
Lie?

177
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,190
If I didn't lie, would you get in my car?

178
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,030
You made such a joke

179
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,240
at this point?

180
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,440
I just don't want you to leave me.

181
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,990
So I could only take some photos

182
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,130
as the evidence.

183
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,230
What do you want?

184
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:14,900
You are calling someone?

185
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,030
Who are you calling?

186
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,410
Give it to me.

187
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,490
Give it to me!

188
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,730
Give it back to me!

189
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,050
Sit tight.

190
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,320
Let go of me!

191
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,130
Something happened to Jiali.

192
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,760
This is strange.

193
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,590
Why is there nothing?

194
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,460
Are you drooling?

195
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,150
I'm hungry.

196
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,310
It's almost time for work.

197
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,240
Why haven't Haikuo and Keke come back yet?

198
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,510
Breakfast is important.

199
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,540
It's the beginning of a day.

200
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,720
If we have breakfast in a hurry,

201
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,920
it won't be elegant.

202
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,030
What do you want to eat?

203
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:43,990
Whatever.

204
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,220
Whatever?

205
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,290
Why is there nothing?

206
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,290
Considering how frugal Jian Keke is,

207
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,360
the food ingredients bought by her

208
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,790
should only be enough for just one meal.

209
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,609
What should we do then?

210
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,760
Then skip breakfast.

211
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,190
Skip it?

212
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,450
But if we don't have breakfast,

213
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,490
we will be weak

214
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,420
and we can't be very focused.

215
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,280
Also, it'll make me feel the day hasn't begun.

216
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,960
What's more important is

217
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,300
we'll gain weight

218
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,520
if we don't have breakfast.

219
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,260
Okay, then...

220
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,560
then have breakfast.

221
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,080
Okay.

222
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm going to call Haikuo

223
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,750
to see if they can help

224
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,520
buy breakfast for us

225
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,670
when they come back.

226
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,830
Do you want Chinese or Western breakfast?

227
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,100
Whatever.

228
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,250
You don't dare to look at me.

229
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,680
Is it because...

230
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,010
I'm too handsome?

231
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,820
Call them now!

232
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay.

233
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,690
Haikuo didn't answer my call.

234
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,890
You should call Keke.

235
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,630
Hello, Jian Keke.

236
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,760
Where are you going?

237
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,190
Haikuo and I are going to find Jiali.

238
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,840
Haikuo and I are going... Jiali.

239
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,350
Hello?

240
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,040
Hello?

241
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,670
I can't hear what they...

242
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,870
what she is saying.

243
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,020
Turn on the speaker.

244
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,200
Hello, Jian Keke.

245
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,600
Where are you?

246
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,220
Hello?

247
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,780
Haikuo and I are going to find Jiali.

248
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,060
What did you just say?

249
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,760
Jiali is in danger.

250
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,180
We've called the police.

251
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,250
We'll be back soon.

252
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,080
Dan...

253
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,550
Called the police.

254
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,840
Back.

255
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,120
Very strong?

256
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,490
Hold tight?

257
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,710
I've never heard anyone show off their affection so proudly.

258
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,050
Okay, bye.

259
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,310
B...

260
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,350
She said bitch to us.

261
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,600
You are a bitch!

262
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,010
She's impolite.

263
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,910
Hello, this is Happiness Store.

264
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,100
Yuanchong, Jiali suddenly asked for a leave.

265
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,710
I can't find anyone to cover her shift now.

266
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,730
Can you stay there for two more hours?

267
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,460
Jiali?

268
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,280
Is... Is she okay?

269
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,350
She didn't tell me why.

270
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,980
But it didn't sound like anything good.

271
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,450
Anyway, wait for me.

272
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,270
I'll be there within two hours.

273
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,360
Hello?

274
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,710
Did something happen to Jiali?

275
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,660
Move.

276
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,710
Move!

277
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,180
Move!

278
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,010
Zhigang,

279
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,960
let me leave first, okay?

280
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,160
I have to work today.

281
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,880
If Manager knows I'm not there,

282
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,140
he'll call the police.

283
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,300
Call the police?

284
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,430
Do you think I'll believe you?

285
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
You can give me the cellphone first.

286
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,080
Please let me go, okay?

287
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,050
Can we break up peacefully?

288
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,970
How many times have I told you?

289
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,260
I don't want to break up with you!

290
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,610
I already told you

291
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,500
that I can't live without you.

292
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,950
How many times do I have to tell you this?

293
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,610
Okay.

294
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,930
Let's get back together.

295
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,530
Let's get back together now.

296
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,000
Is that okay?

297
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,540
Sorry.

298
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,180
Zhigang, don't be angry.

299
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,690
Get back together?

300
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,550
Zhigang.

301
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,410
-Please.
-Get back together.

302
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,590
I don't believe it.

303
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,880
You're lying to me.

304
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,050
You've been with that young man for a long time.

305
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,730
You think I don't know?

306
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,670
In that case,

307
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,090
don't blame me for doing this the hard way.

308
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,410
What are you going to do, Zhigang?

309
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,890
The location of Jiali's cellphone is here.

310
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,890
It should be here.

311
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,650
It looks like no one lives here.

312
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,870
Where are you going?

313
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,280
Keke.

314
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,390
Jia...

315
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,630
Keke, why didn't you listen...

316
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,110
to me?

317
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,170
You're proposing?

318
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,690
Jiali,

319
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,400
I don't have much money,

320
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,920
but I'm very sincere.

321
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,360
Well...

322
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,110
Why did you scream just now?

323
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,250
When I took off the mask just now,

324
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
I felt shocked.

325
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,380
So you kidnapped her

326
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,270
in order to propose to her?

327
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,860
Yes.

328
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,380
Jiali.

329
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,350
You're really so nice to me.

330
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,820
I can't live without you.

331
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,890
Only after losing something

332
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,420
will one know to cherish it.

333
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm just a fool.

334
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,190
Jiali.

335
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,020
None of the other women treat me

336
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,150
as nicely as you did,

337
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,720
and when I didn't have money, you were willing to help me,

338
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,790
care about me,

339
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,100
and even listen to me.

340
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,230
Anyway, you're also looking forward to

341
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,430
a home that needs you.

342
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,760
Then this is a good chance.

343
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,820
Let's be together.

344
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,720
I will cherish you for the rest of my life.

345
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,390
Marry him.

346
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,030
Dream of it in your next life!

347
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,830
Why did you hit him?

348
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,170
I kicked him.

349
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,300
You didn't usually cherish her,

350
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,100
but now you're talking nonsense there.

351
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,000
Jiali.

352
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,240
Please.

353
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,200
Please don't abandon me. Okay?

354
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,880
I can't live without you.

355
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,980
I've seriously told you that

356
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,470
it's over between us.

357
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,620
Please don't be like this anymore.

358
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,620
But we once loved each other so much.

359
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,480
Right. You once said this.

360
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,160
You once said that I needed you very much.

361
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,930
But compared with romantic love,

362
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,660
I'm just eagerer for the feeling of being needed.

363
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,670
Did you hear that?

364
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,010
So,

365
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,350
we've never loved each other.

366
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,850
Zhigang.

367
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,520
Let's go.

368
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,940
Let's go.

369
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,530
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,260
Maybe

371
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,580
I need you two to stay.

372
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,040
What do you want to do?

373
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,380
The police will be here soon.

374
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,860
Police?

375
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,070
Why did you call the police?

376
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,500
We were just trying to propose to her.

377
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,640
This was very romantic.

378
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,700
Is it that serious?

379
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,460
What are you doing?

380
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,300
Wait.

381
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,250
My mobile phone!

382
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,830
Give it back to me.

383
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,470
Thank you for recording

384
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,990
the evidence of the kidnapping just now.

385
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,450
I'll also give it to the police.

386
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:15,970
You...

387
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,470
[Trendee, Accounting Department]

388
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,780
See?

389
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,220
I can't believe that Keke didn't come.

390
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,920
The most incredible thing in our company

391
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,300
finally happened.

392
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,180
Don't you think it's strange?

393
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,020
Keke didn't ask for leave.

394
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,080
That's absence from work.

395
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,860
Oh, my God.

396
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,790
Is something

397
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,980
unexpected going to happen?

398
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,530
I have an appointment with Chen Shi.

399
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,470
I have to go.

400
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,290
Bye.

401
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,940
You mean Chen Shi from the Business Department?

402
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,890
Yes.

403
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,090
The second most

404
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,490
incredible thing in our company happened.

405
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,910
I can't believe that Elly transferred her target

406
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,060
to Chen Shi, who has no money or power.

407
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,240
Do you think

408
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,060
this is a sign that the company will go bankrupt?

409
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,630
I've only worked here for three months.

410
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,870
What should I do?

411
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,680
We need to look for a new job.

412
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,690
Why are you so nervous?

413
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,980
Last time, Katy informed you secretly.

414
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,850
Fortunately, our manager didn't blame me.

415
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,480
Don't worry.

416
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,500
I asked you out today just in order to

417
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,070
have a meal with you.

418
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,720
I don't think you just want to simply have a meal.

419
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,510
Don't understand me so well.

420
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,790
In that case,

421
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,890
there won't be

422
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,750
any secrets

423
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,800
between us, will there?

424
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,500
What do you want to ask?

425
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,890
Here's the thing.

426
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,820
I've been living in Haikuo's home lately, haven't I?

427
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,360
And I've found that

428
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,470
there are no photos of him and his family at his home.

429
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,420
There's not a single photo of that.

430
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,400
So I want to ask you

431
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,220
what his parents' occupations are,

432
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,020
and whether he has any siblings.

433
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,250
I'm not sure, either.

434
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,760
Mr. Wang has never told me

435
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,820
about his family.

436
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,530
Not even a word?

437
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,700
Not even a word.

438
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,330
Could it be that

439
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,010
he's just like the male lead in a TV drama?

440
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,640
In order to learn social experience,

441
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,370
he started from a basic-level job,

442
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,200
laying the foundation for his future position as CEO,

443
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,000
so he cut off contact with his family temporarily?

444
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,120
You're thinking too much.

445
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,660
Maybe he just doesn't have any family.

446
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,130
However, why do you insist that

447
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,680
he must have parents?

448
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,130
If Haikuo belongs to the rich second-generation,

449
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,960
the rich first-generation must be his parents.

450
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,260
It's okay that he has no siblings,

451
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,990
but it's not okay that he doesn't have parents.

452
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,120
Right?

453
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,630
It seems right.

454
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,050
Why...

455
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,720
are you looking at me so strangely like that?

456
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,680
I'm not looking at you.

457
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,680
I'm looking at him.

458
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,160
Why are you here?

459
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,470
I'm here to take you home.

460
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,900
You guys...

461
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,380
I'm here to take you to

462
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,480
Haikuo's home.

463
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,200
Today, I've

464
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,740
even brought

465
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,840
high-class hand cream.

466
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,170
Tonight,

467
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,470
we can nourish our hands together.

468
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,670
Excuse me.

469
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,660
We're not close enough

470
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,090
to nourish hands together.

471
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,630
Besides,

472
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,540
please

473
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,890
don't touch me arbitrarily

474
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,260
without my permission.

475
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,000
Because if you do this,

476
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,730
I'll feel very uncomfortable.

477
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,730
Why did Elly react so intensely?

478
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,660
How come you turned into a black-and-white image?

479
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,110
Because I'm really hurt.

480
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,140
I thought that

481
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,250
only Keke had no feelings for me.

482
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,420
I didn't expect that Elly would go far beyond that.

483
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,180
I can't believe that she hates me so much.

484
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,560
Don't be too discouraged.

485
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,520
However,

486
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,780
I won't admit defeat.

487
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,350
I'll bet with the dignity as a man.

488
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,510
I'll make Elly

489
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,790
change her view of me.

490
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,760
Elly.

491
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:44,950
I'm coming.

492
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,720
What about your luggage?

493
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,140
Grandma.

494
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,180
I'm back.

495
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,770
She looks so pale.

496
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,570
What happened?

497
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,300
Are you going to compensate for the damage if you break it?

498
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,170
I was absent from work.

499
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,270
Just like that, I lost

500
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,480
a day's salary.

501
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,580
I've also lost my full-attendance bonus.

502
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,860
But your friend needed you today.

503
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,980
But

504
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,750
I feel guilty.

505
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,390
I feel sorry for my bank account.

506
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,260
Money is not the most important thing.

507
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,160
At least, today, you made

508
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,240
a decision which you thought was the rightest one at that time.

509
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,370
You won't regret it.

510
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,140
You're really nice.

511
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,590
Thank you for today.

512
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,510
I'm sorry for making you absent from work.

513
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,570
It's okay.

514
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,070
I happened to have no clients today.

515
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,620
I've told you I don't want it.

516
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,680
Stop following me.

517
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,420
If you don't apply a mask to your face,

518
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,050
you should at least use this facial massager.

519
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,420
It's really good. Just try it.

520
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,710
What are you two doing?

521
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,880
Haikuo's hands got injured.

522
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,410
I'm helping him check his hands.

523
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,280
He got injured?

524
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,910
How come you're injured?

525
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,080
Not only did your body get seriously injured,

526
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,870
but your hands also got injured.

527
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,760
Why were you so careless?

528
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,430
Come on.

529
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,390
-I'm not injured. -I have a medical kit.

530
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,190
-You're injured.
-I've brought it.

531
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,950
Though it's a minor injury,

532
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,610
you still need to apply ointment to your wounds.

533
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,990
Haikuo's mobile phone?

534
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,210
It's strange.

535
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,320
Why isn't there any contact information of his family

536
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,120
or call records with his family?

537
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:14,659
Grandma.

538
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,050
I'm back.

539
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,590
You're back.

540
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,219
How was your interview today?

541
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,170
I don't know.

542
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,520
I think it was okay.

543
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,790
It's all right.

544
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,110
Take your time

545
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,070
to look for a job. There's no hurry.

546
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,870
Why are you here?

547
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
I asked him to come here and repair the water pipe for me.

548
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,060
When I washed the dishes in the morning,

549
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,650
the kitchen sink was blocked and the water couldn't go down,

550
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,060
so I asked him to come.

551
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,710
Your grandma and I have added each other to our friend lists before.

552
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,639
You know how to repair water pipes?

553
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,630
Yes, I learned it from my dad.

554
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,800
Does your family run a plumber's shop?

555
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,659
No.

556
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,790
As my dad and I

557
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,409
are the only two men in our family,

558
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,740
I'm the one who helps him do lots of things.

559
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,800
So you're also from a single-parent family?

560
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,510
No, Grandma.

561
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,810
In our family, I still have two elder sisters

562
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,990
and two younger sisters,

563
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,270
so I have to do most of the things.

564
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,300
It turns out that you live in the girls' dorm.

565
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,390
No wonder you're so good.

566
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,650
You can do everything.

567
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,730
He looks like a remarkable man.

568
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,140
I didn't sense it before.

569
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,660
Grandma,

570
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,120
is there anything else you want me to repair?

571
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,680
The light bulb in my room is broken.

572
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,640
Okay.

573
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,980
After I repair the water pipe for you,

574
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,700
I'll go check it.

575
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,910
Okay.

576
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,200
Grandma, I've repaired it.

577
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,670
Awesome!

578
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,670
Can you repair electrical appliances?

579
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,840
Electrical appliances?

580
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,470
Yes, I can.

581
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,230
Can you cook?

582
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,770
Cooking?

583
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,100
Yes, I can.

584
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,970
You got up too early in the morning.

585
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,960
Go take a rest and get some sleep.

586
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,290
But...

587
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,160
It's okay.

588
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,530
Go take a rest now if you're tired.

589
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,720
Just now, I noticed that the light bulb at your home was broken.

590
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,030
I'll repair it for your grandma.

591
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,200
Right. I'll accompany Yuanchong.

592
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,430
Go get some sleep now.

593
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,340
Alright.

594
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,760
If you need me,

595
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,490
just tell me.

596
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,800
There won't be anything that will need your help.

597
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,040
Go to sleep.

598
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,100
Okay. I'll go take a rest first.

599
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,170
Yuan.

600
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,800
Because of

601
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,880
her family,

602
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,980
Jiali tends to be quite vigilant.

603
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,360
If you really like her,

604
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,380
you have to be more patient.

605
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,610
Got it?

606
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,440
Then I'll go buy a light bulb.

607
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,330
I'll be back soon.

608
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,290
Okay. Go.

609
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,050
This kid is really good.

610
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,920
Jian Keke.

611
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,320
I need to talk to you.

612
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,860
What's the matter?

613
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,660
It's about Haikuo's family.

614
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,740
What's wrong with Haikuo's family?

615
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,970
Don't you think Haikuo's family is very mysterious?

616
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,070
So?

617
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,960
I've asked Chen Shi about it.

618
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,750
He said that Haikuo rarely talked about his family.

619
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,020
I also didn't see any photos of him

620
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,020
and his family at his house that day.

621
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,100
Does he really have no family?

622
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,490
When I was a sophomore in high school,

623
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,350
my mom was diagnosed with cancer.

624
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,030
When my mom passed away,

625
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,210
my dad had never come to visit her.

626
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,820
Do you know something?

627
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,890
How would I know something?

628
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,780
I checked Haikuo's mobile phone, too.

629
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,920
As expected, I found that

630
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,590
he didn't have

631
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,840
any contact with his family.

632
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,800
Don't you think it's weird?

633
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,680
You're the weird one.

634
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,650
How could you check his mobile phone?

635
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,790
What's more, that's Haikuo's business.

636
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,570
You should ask him. Why are you asking me?

637
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,500
There's something wrong with your moral character.

638
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,200
She doesn't seem to care.

639
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,960
You're silly.

640
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,740
If she really didn't care,

641
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,990
why did she stop and listen to Elly talk about it just now?

642
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,200
That makes sense.

643
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,680
I think

644
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,880
she must know something.

645
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,730
Because she hesitated just now.

646
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,930
-Really?
-Really?

647
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,230
Play the video.

648
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,260
Does Haikuo really have no family?

649
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,990
Judging from her expression, I think she thought of something.

650
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,010
You're right.

651
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,450
The definition of this mobile phone is so high.

652
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,480
It could even capture

653
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,020
such a subtle expression.

654
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,860
Unfortunately,

655
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,730
we didn't choose a good angle just now.

656
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,140
It would be more perfect

657
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,880
if we had shot the video from the front side.

658
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,200
No matter how I shot the video,

659
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,140
it can't cover up the truth that

660
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,600
Jian Keke is hiding something.

661
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,120
Has Haikuo never contacted

662
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,320
his family or relatives

663
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,980
after his mother passed away?

664
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,950
What about his father?

665
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,870
Jian Keke!

666
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,940
Excuse me.

667
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,090
Do you have time now?

668
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,990
I have something to ask you.

669
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,090
Just tell me what you want to ask me about.

670
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,660
I care about Jiali very much.

671
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,790
So I want to ask you

672
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,100
about her.

673
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
Then why don't you ask her directly?

674
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,500
Because she doesn't want to see me.

675
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,040
You're...

676
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,090
a nice person.

677
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,820
And you know what Jiali needs.

678
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,490
You're also very obedient to Jiali.

679
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,750
But she won't like you.

680
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,760
I don't understand.

681
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,480
Even for a bastard like Wu Zhigang,

682
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,850
Jiali was willing to give him a chance

683
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,820
again and again.

684
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,270
Why am I not okay for her?

685
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,860
Maybe it's because

686
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,560
your appearance isn't what she likes.

687
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,140
But...

688
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,730
Jiali doesn't like Wu Zhigang that much.

689
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,930
Why can't she give up on him all the time?

690
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Because...

691
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,090
Wait.

692
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,740
Can you

693
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,410
stop being so straightforward to me?

694
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,050
Just put it another way.

695
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,420
Okay?

696
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,280
Because

697
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,320
Zhigang needs Jiali very much.

698
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,560
Jiali needs the feeling of being needed very much.

699
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,600
When Jiali was a kid,

700
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,630
she was a very happy little princess.

701
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,210
Both her parents doted on her very much.

702
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,030
Come on. Let's have some fruits.

703
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,980
Look at the photo we've just taken.

704
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,180
So cute.

705
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,400
Take a photo for us.

706
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,550
Look here.

707
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,560
One, two, three.

708
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,690
Let me have a look.

709
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,160
Mom, look at this photo.

710
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,520
So cute.

711
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,010
Come on.

712
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,650
Let me take a photo for you three.

713
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,760
The three of us? Okay.

714
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,440
Come on.

715
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,560
One, two, three.

716
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,360
But not long after that,

717
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,180
the relationship between her parents was over.

718
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,430
They quarreled with each other every day.

719
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,030
They got divorced in the end.

720
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,140
Where can I find you?

721
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,840
-I'll be very worried about you.
-I won't come back.

722
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,190
You're always so fierce.

723
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,750
Because of work,

724
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,730
they couldn't take care of her,

725
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,230
so Jiali lived with her grandma.

726
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,640
Happy birthday to you.

727
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,400
Is it delicious?

728
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes.

729
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,350
At first,

730
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,930
she was still deeply loved by her parents.

731
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,160
Xin is really amazing.

732
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,050
But later,

733
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,420
after they formed a family respectively,

734
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,640
Jiali became the redundant person.

735
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,800
When they went out for fun, they wouldn't take her.

736
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,170
At most, they would just bring her a gift.

737
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,250
But gradually,

738
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,910
there was nothing.

739
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:43,850
Happy birthday to me.

740
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,570
The world is very cruel.

741
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,790
The happiness you once had

742
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,040
was lost later.

743
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,930
Then you watched it

744
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,250
happen to others.

745
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,350
So you mean

746
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,160
Jiali doesn't believe in love?

747
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,370
Love may fade away with time,

748
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,500
but demands won't.

749
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,060
So Jiali needs the feeling of being needed very much.

750
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:17,750
That's why

751
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,580
you can't make her feel touched.

752
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,560
Because she is too afraid of having happiness.

753
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,410
No wonder she chose Wu Zhigang,

754
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,360
instead of me.

755
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,790
No matter how much love you give Jiali,

756
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,000
it will only make her feel insecure.

757
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,090
That's because

758
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,530
the fact that her parents abandoned her

759
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,060
has really hurt her so much.

760
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,360
How could they do this?

761
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,290
They've gone too far.

762
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
Are you crying?

763
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,390
I used to pass by your heart.

764
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,220
It's not that I didn't want to stay,

765
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,320
but you didn't want to take me in.

766
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,130
Time

767
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,510
doesn't make us forget the pain,

768
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,820
but it just makes us get used to pain.

769
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,990
What are you talking about?

770
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,630
Why?

771
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,640
Whether I went to the left

772
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,350
or went to the right,

773
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,870
I still...

774
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,100
I still couldn't get out.

775
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,430
I couldn't get out.

776
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,900
Stop...

777
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,670
Stop crying first.

778
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,160
Well,

779
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,960
I'll find a way to help you. Okay?

780
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,340
Really?

781
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,060
Yes.

782
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,350
[Preview]

783
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,350
Yuanchong

784
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,810
seems to care about you very much.

785
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,530
Grandma,

786
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,200
we're just friends.

787
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,680
Dear senior schoolmate,

788
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,010
don't you recognize me?

789
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,870
Xiao Qianqian?

790
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,580
Thank you for saving me during the day.

791
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,700
Don't think that

792
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,000
just because you did me a small favor,

793
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,120
I will change my view of you.

794
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,120
Keke's Dad, Haikuo was so fast.

795
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,320
1.7 seconds.

796
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,020
Just be honest with me.

797
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,210
Do you have

798
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,940
a slight crush on him?

799
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:15,870
What answer should I give?
