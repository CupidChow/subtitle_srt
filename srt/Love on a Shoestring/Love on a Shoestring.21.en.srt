[Love on a Shoestring]

3
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,700
I'm back.

4
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,580
You're back.

5
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,280
[Episode 21]

6
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,230
Why are you back so late today?

7
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,760
You worked overtime again?

8
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,850
No.

9
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,760
Haikuo suddenly resigned.

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,390
I went to the interview with him.

11
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,650
He suddenly resigned?

12
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,230
Did he get fired?

13
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,090
No.

14
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,390
He's very competent.

15
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,759
How could he get fired?

16
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,650
He resigned because he wants

17
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,850
a higher income.

18
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,590
Although he resigned today,

19
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,050
he found a job immediately.

20
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,590
He found a job immediately?

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,100
He's really impressive.

22
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,240
I see.

23
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,009
Since he's in a relationship with Keke,

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
he wants Keke to live a better life.

25
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,289
So he changed his job

26
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,280
to make more money,

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,340
so that he can save more money, right?

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,130
I'm going to get changed first.

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,160
Okay.

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,660
Come and eat fruits after you get changed.

31
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,640
Have a taste.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,470
Okay, eat.

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,890
Haikuo

34
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,550
is really thoughtful.

35
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,460
For Keke,

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,120
he wants a better job. Look.

37
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,560
He changed his job

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
to make more money and save more money.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,150
Everything he did is for Keke.

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,420
Great.

41
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,530
Don't eat too much.

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,600
Save some for Keke.

43
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,040
This is a white lie.

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,440
I can't let them be worried.

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,540
It's almost 11 p.m.

46
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,670
Elly is still not going to sleep?

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,270
Wake up.

48
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,260
Wake up.

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,360
Michael,

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,900
you can't fall asleep.

51
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,630
I'm not gonna give in.

52
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,190
I can't see things.

53
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,670
I'm blind!

54
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,220
I'm blind! I can't see things!

55
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,550
Help! I'm blind!

56
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,640
I can't see things!

57
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,620
You're wearing an eyeshade.

58
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,190
I was so scared.

59
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,610
I'm in my house?

60
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,410
We even...

61
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,330
slept in the same bed.

62
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,050
Did anything happen between us?

63
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,040
Of course.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,340
I cuddled you when I slept.

65
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,210
Also, you slept very soundly.

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,820
What's wrong?

67
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,690
What's wrong?

68
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,940
How did I get back yesterday?

69
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,660
How come I don't remember anything?

70
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,110
Last night,

71
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,920
I saw you fall asleep downstairs at your house.

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,250
Besides, you slept so soundly

73
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,780
that I couldn't wake you up.

74
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,940
So I had to...

75
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,090
move you back home.

76
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,890
It took me a lot of effort

77
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,960
to bring you home.

78
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,180
But you carried me upstairs once.

79
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,200
At the thought of that...

80
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,659
I didn't feel tired at all.

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,930
No wonder

82
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,650
I felt pain everywhere

83
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,260
when I just got up.

84
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,780
What's wrong?

85
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,690
Let me... Let me apply the ointment for you.

86
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,650
No need for that.

87
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,670
It's okay.

88
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,020
I can do it myself.

89
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,540
I'm going to take a shower first.

90
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,620
Don't touch me.

91
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,790
Where are my clothes?

92
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,970
In the lower part.

93
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,460
If you want a towel and underwear,

94
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,140
they're in the middle drawer.

95
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,190
Is this still my home?

96
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,840
No.

97
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,460
Now, this is...

98
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,580
our home.

99
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,190
When you were not home that night,

100
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,230
I ordered

101
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,520
slippers,

102
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,890
key chains,

103
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,000
and all daily necessities for couples.

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,350
I placed an order on the e-commerce platform

105
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,790
and the goods were delivered immediately.

106
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,220
Right.

107
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,410
I also used the company's AI product function

108
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,510
to order the same products as yours.

109
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,030
Look.

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,309
I know you're action-oriented,

111
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,860
but I didn't know you're so action-oriented.

112
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,020
So if you still don't plan to come back,

113
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,299
I will continue to transform your home.

114
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,150
Will you come back to sleep tonight?

115
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,540
I'll be home on time today.

116
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,630
Very good! Good boy!

117
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
-Put it on the bed.
-It hurts.

118
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,580
You... don't agree?

119
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,110
Sir,

120
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,060
it's not that I don't agree.

121
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,030
Haikuo wants to resign.

122
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,470
That's his own will.

123
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,460
Aren't you his girlfriend?

124
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,730
Even if I were his mother today,

125
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,460
he still wouldn't listen to me.

126
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,250
Aren't you worried that I'll fire you?

127
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,320
Sir,

128
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,800
if you really want to fire me

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,840
because of this,

130
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,370
I can only accept it.

131
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,650
But even if you fire me,

132
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,490
Haikuo will still resign

133
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,940
if he wants to resign.

134
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,090
Jian Keke.

135
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,950
Sir,

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,460
I'm really sorry.

137
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,810
But no matter how angry you are,

138
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,750
I can't promise you

139
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,210
something that I can't do.

140
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm going back to work first.

141
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,570
Keke,

142
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,700
figure out a way,

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,350
please.

144
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,720
President Wang said

145
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
if Haikuo resigns,

146
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,270
he won't cooperate with us.

147
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
Our company is just a small and medium-sized enterprise.

148
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,660
This order is very important

149
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,830
to us.

150
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,120
S-Sir,

151
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,890
I...

152
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,680
You know it's not easy

153
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,560
to run a company.

154
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,990
The livelihoods of many employees depend on it.

155
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,390
Please, figure out a way.

156
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,220
S-Sir.

157
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,960
Sir, stand up first.

158
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,020
Stand up first, okay? Stand up first.

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,710
It's not that I don't want to help you.

160
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,310
It's just that there really is nothing I can do.

161
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,090
Is there really no other way?

162
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,690
Alright.

163
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,330
Maybe I can't

164
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,760
talk Haikuo out of resigning,

165
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,510
but I will

166
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,660
try my best to help the company

167
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,000
not lose this order.

168
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:50,910
Really?

169
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,290
I'll try my best.

170
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,700
Keke,

171
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,350
thank you.

172
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,840
Thank you.

173
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,900
Please.

174
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,580
You're too impulsive.

175
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,690
That's right.

176
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,180
You don't need to do this, right?

177
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,800
This is your future.

178
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,410
You should decide your own future.

179
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,580
You can't make it a lose-lose situation

180
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,910
because of your father.

181
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
It's not a lose-lose situation.

182
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,240
I've already found a new job.

183
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,770
They offer me a higher salary

184
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,030
and a longer vacation.

185
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,390
Does Keke also agree with your decision to resign?

186
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,440
No wonder.

187
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,590
No wonder you didn't

188
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,390
go to Keke today

189
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,320
and Keke didn't come to you either.

190
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,670
You two are in a relationship.

191
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,750
Your future

192
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,060
is also her future.

193
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Together, right?

194
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,630
This is my family affair.

195
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,190
I don't want to trouble her.

196
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,730
You said he's powerful, right?

197
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,320
He can monitor your movements.

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,960
If so, when can you

199
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,290
stop changing your job?

200
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,390
Till the end of the world.

201
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,430
I bet

202
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,520
he has the same personality as his father.

203
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,320
They are both stubborn.

204
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,820
Like father, like son.

205
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,270
Say it again.

206
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,570
Alright.

207
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,240
Forget it.

208
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,720
If you resign just because you want to,

209
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,820
how can you give Keke a stable life?

210
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,310
Do you really consider me family?

211
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,240
Being family doesn't mean making decisions alone

212
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,440
or just informing me of your decisions.

213
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,290
And you made me worry all day

214
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,040
because I couldn't find you.

215
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,300
All day.

216
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,620
I'm gonna call Dad.

217
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,780
Are you going to make peace with your dad?

218
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,960
Keke's dad.

219
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,120
Why are you calling Keke's dad?

220
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,380
What did you say?

221
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,420
I said I want

222
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,420
to gain your approval.

223
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,280
I want to propose

224
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,930
to Keke.

225
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,450
Pro...?

226
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,840
Be honest with me.

227
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,450
Did you do something

228
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,270
to Keke?

229
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,620
Why do you suddenly want to propose to her?

230
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,090
What's wrong with you?

231
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,800
Could it be...

232
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,860
Could...

233
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,520
Could it be you already made her pregnant?

234
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,310
No.

235
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,800
Mr... Mr. Jian, don't worry.

236
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,020
Nothing has happened between Keke and me

237
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,070
so far.

238
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,110
You want something to happen

239
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,300
between you and Keke.

240
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,800
Right?

241
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,520
Just cut the crap.

242
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,300
Go away.

243
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,280
Let me ask him.

244
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,360
You were full of crap.

245
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,270
Here's the thing.

246
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,370
It's been only less than three months since you started dating Keke.

247
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,490
Why do you suddenly want to propose to her?

248
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,370
Because we love each other sincerely.

249
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,170
So I want to give her a guarantee.

250
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,370
But do you two

251
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,290
know each other very well?

252
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,930
It's true that we are from

253
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,990
two totally different families.

254
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,590
And we still need to compromise because of our different values.

255
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,270
But this won't change my desire

256
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,470
to give her a promise.

257
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,990
I know

258
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,410
you are still worried.

259
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,450
It's okay.

260
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,190
I came prepared.

261
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,880
What did you prepare?

262
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,970
These are my insurance policies since childhood

263
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,970
and my savings insurance policies.

264
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,540
And this is my bankbook.

265
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,030
And my seal.

266
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,960
I've transferred everything to Keke's name.

267
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,690
Also,

268
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,620
although it's just a proposal,

269
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,660
I plan to buy a house within a year.

270
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,460
We'll have a wedding

271
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,950
after I buy a house.

272
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,110
Of course,

273
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,020
Keke will manage all our assets after we get married.

274
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,560
Good. This is good.

275
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,290
Well...

276
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,010
Mr. Jian, Mrs. Jian, do you agree?

277
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,410
The point...

278
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,230
is not

279
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,900
if we agree or not.

280
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,020
It's up to Keke whether she wants

281
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,850
to accept your proposal or not.

282
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,580
I see.

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,370
What's going on?

284
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,890
Did she forget something?

285
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,420
What's wrong with you?

286
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,180
What...

287
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,070
What are you doing here?

288
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,270
Haikuo is so thoughtful.

289
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,960
He even came to us

290
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,790
to discuss his proposal to Keke.

291
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,620
Besides, everything centers on Keke.

292
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,300
He even asked Keke's parents

293
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,000
about the proposal ring.

294
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,880
I can truly feel

295
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,690
he really cares about Keke.

296
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm happy for my best friend.

297
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,200
In the future,

298
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,380
I'll also give you

299
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,840
a very romantic proposal.

300
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,839
What's wrong?

301
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,060
I saw someone who looks a lot like my mom.

302
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,730
That person?

303
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,550
Forget it.

304
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,430
I guess I mistook her for my mom.

305
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,290
How could she possibly come to me?

306
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,290
What's wrong with you?

307
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,330
Why do you look so concerned about me?

308
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,440
I'm not sad.

309
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,170
Go back to rest now.

310
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,310
You need to oversee the work tomorrow morning, right?

311
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:47,730
Bye bye.

312
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,910
Bye bye.

313
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,240
You don't want to leave me?

314
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,480
I don't want to leave you.

315
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,330
Grandma.

316
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,140
Grandma.

317
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,490
You're back.

318
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,250
Why do you look so troubled?

319
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,170
No.

320
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,730
I was thinking about your plan to open a shop.

321
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,640
I was so preoccupied with it

322
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,520
that I didn't know you came back.

323
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,700
Don't worry.

324
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,010
Now I have

325
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,930
Yuanchong's help.

326
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,660
Everything is going smoothly.

327
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,770
That's good.

328
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,920
I... I feel a little tired.

329
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,650
I'm going inside to rest first.

330
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,220
Rest early.

331
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,960
Jiali,

332
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,830
listen.

333
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,260
No matter who wants to borrow money from you,

334
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,490
you can't agree.

335
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,150
Grandma,

336
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,530
why are you suddenly saying this?

337
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,190
I'm just worried Zhigang

338
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,560
will come to pester you again.

339
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,190
Don't worry.

340
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,490
I'm preparing to open a shop.

341
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,620
I need a lot of money.

342
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,980
I won't lend money to anyone else.

343
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,930
Okay, if so,

344
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,310
I feel relieved.

345
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,580
Good night.

346
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,360
Good night.

347
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,030
[Love]

348
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,540
Calm down.

349
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,950
I should be composed.

350
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,480
Calm down.

351
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,060
Don't be impulsive.

352
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,790
Mi,

353
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,990
it's already 9:28 p.m.

354
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,310
Come and have your beauty sleep.

355
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,800
Okay.

356
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,790
No.

357
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,050
Form is emptiness.

358
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,780
Emptiness is form.

359
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,040
Zhao Zilong,

360
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,190
you have to stay calm this time.

361
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,420
Otherwise, your heart

362
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,330
will be broken.

363
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,390
Amen.

364
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,280
Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.

365
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,300
Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.

366
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,820
Form is emptiness.

367
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,120
Emptiness is form.

368
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,940
Form is emptiness, emptiness is...

369
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,730
Mi,

370
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,150
I'm already waiting for you in bed.

371
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,290
Do you want to know

372
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,360
what I'm like

373
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,060
under the quilt?

374
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,040
Not really.

375
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,340
Look!

376
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,990
We even have matching pajamas for couples.

377
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,850
What...

378
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,690
What's wrong?

379
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,340
I feel weak.

380
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,490
No.

381
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,280
My feet are a little weak.

382
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,050
Come to bed and sleep now.

383
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,310
It's already 9:28 now.

384
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,300
Okay.

385
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,030
Good night.

386
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,870
Good night.

387
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,590
Good night.

388
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,120
Here are 100,000 NT dollars.

389
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,760
That's all my property.

390
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:39,720
Mom.

391
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,750
Don't call me Mom.

392
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,020
You abandoned

393
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,190
your own child and left just like that.

394
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,690
I had never expected that I would have a daughter like you.

395
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,960
You're so cruel.

396
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,940
Don't go to see Jiali again.

397
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,200
You don't have to return these 100,000 NT dollars to me.

398
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,390
I'll just give them to you.

399
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,240
Mom!

400
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,230
One hundred thousand NT dollars are not enough.

401
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,350
If the money is not enough, that's your family's business.

402
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,350
I forbid you to go to see Jiali again!

403
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,850
Mrs. Guo's daughter is going to get married.

404
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,910
But why are we coming to the hospital?

405
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,520
Well...

406
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,200
Premarital health checkups

407
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,560
are quite popular nowadays, aren't they?

408
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,150
Yes.

409
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,280
Before marriage,

410
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,630
if both parties can confirm that

411
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,500
they are both

412
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,930
in good health,

413
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,310
they will be happy after marriage.

414
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,680
Yes.

415
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,590
I also think that

416
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,060
premarital health checkups are very important.

417
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,590
But honesty between our family members

418
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,360
is more important, isn't it?

419
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,420
Are you two hiding something from me?

420
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,420
What are you talking about?

421
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,290
It sounds as if we were outsiders.

422
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,300
We are your biological parents.

423
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,130
We wouldn't lie to you, would we?

424
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,460
Dad, do you know that

425
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,060
every time when you lie,

426
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,860
your hands will

427
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,530
keep rubbing each other like this.

428
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,990
They will also sweat a lot.

429
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,430
Do you want to take a look?

430
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,350
My dear daughter,

431
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,420
why are you so suspicious?

432
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,950
-Right.
-Mrs. Guo is already waiting inside.

433
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,330
You have to go even though you don't want to.

434
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:12,860
Let's go!

435
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,350
-Let's go now.
-Let's go.

436
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,280
Hurry up.

437
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,460
They're waiting for you.

438
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,160
No.

439
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,320
Look.

440
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,290
There are a bunch of people over there, aren't there?

441
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,630
Haikuo is waiting for you.

442
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,700
Go there now.

443
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,480
Hurry up. Go.

444
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,580
Keke feels very surprised,

445
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,830
and I have to take a photo of this scene.

446
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,390
Then I can laugh at her in the future.

447
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,080
Look.

448
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,070
Keke must have never expected this.

449
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,040
Look at Keke's expression.

450
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,550
She feels so surprised.

451
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,200
-Go a bit forward.
-Okay.

452
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,730
Do you remember this place?

453
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:45,660
This is

454
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,020
the place where we first met.

455
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,330
Since then,

456
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,470
you've been engraved in my memory deeply.

457
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,940
Although many years had passed,

458
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,270
I finally found you.

459
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,310
But you are still the same.

460
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,340
You're always the same.

461
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,440
You're both pure

462
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,660
and kind-hearted.

463
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,530
This time,

464
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,590
I told myself that

465
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I would never let you leave me again.

466
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,840
It started.

467
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,790
Haikuo, come on!

468
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,640
Haikuo, come on!

469
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,760
Jian Keke.

470
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,670
Will you marry me?

471
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,340
Marry him!

472
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,490
Keke, what are you doing?

473
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,230
Say yes.

474
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,930
Right.

475
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,040
Keke.

477
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,590
Are you so surprised that

478
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,250
you've said something wrong?

479
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,920
It's right not to say yes.

480
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,210
This place is not romantic at all, right?

481
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,840
-Right?
-Yes.

482
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,710
Yes.

483
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,800
I told you not to use a hospital as the venue.

484
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,030
No matter how romantic the decoration is,

485
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,190
there is still the foul smell of

486
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,470
disinfectant more or less.

487
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,370
Yes.

488
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,530
-Yeah.
-Put it away.

489
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,960
I know I'm a bit abrupt.

490
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,560
When I

491
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,800
told Mr. Jian and Mrs. Jian about this,

492
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,400
they also thought that it would be too soon for me to propose now.

493
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,460
It's not about whether it's too soon.

494
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,620
The point is that we're not suitable for each other.

495
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,040
Not suitable?

496
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,890
Wang Haikuo,

497
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,590
let's break up.

498
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,660
Keke!

499
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,310
Keke!

500
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,140
Baby.

501
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,750
Keke!

502
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,960
Keke!

503
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,790
Wait for me.

504
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,600
What's wrong with you?

505
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,660
Why did you suddenly talk about breaking up?

506
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,120
We got along well with each other, didn't we?

507
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,460
Did we really get along well with each other?

508
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,250
When you resigned and disappeared,

509
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,220
you didn't even explain to me.

510
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,220
Now you want to propose to me,

511
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,950
but you didn't even discuss it with me in advance.

512
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,420
I resigned and disappeared.

513
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,720
That was something between my father and me.

514
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,580
I didn't want to get you involved.

515
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,570
I talked to Mr. Jian and Mrs. Jian about the proposal

516
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,770
because I wanted to give you a surprise.

517
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,010
The problem between us

518
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,070
hasn't been solved yet.

519
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,330
Do you think I can accept such a surprise?

520
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,860
This is not just a surprise.

521
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,720
I also tried to solve the problem.

522
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I've told Mr. Jian and Mrs. Jian that

523
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,760
after we get married,

524
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,090
I will transfer all the property I own now

525
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,280
to you.

526
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,180
What you want

527
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,290
is a stable economic state and a sense of security, isn't it?

528
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,600
What I want is not a stable economic state.

529
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,410
But I just want us to be together.

530
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,230
But no matter what happened,

531
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,690
I was just informed by you.

532
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,040
Do you think we can continue to be together like this?

533
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,830
If we can't, why did I do all these things?

534
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,500
You only care about what you want.

535
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,460
You don't really love me.

536
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,440
Baby.

537
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,730
You didn't have dinner.

538
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,190
It's bad for your stomach.

539
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,179
Just eat something. Come on.

540
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,679
Get up.

541
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,270
Mom, I'm sorry

542
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,340
for worrying you.

543
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,179
You don't have to apologize to me.

544
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,700
You are my baby.

545
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,830
Since I gave birth to you,

546
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,230
I've told your father that

547
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,460
we should dote on you and love you forever.

548
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,880
No matter what you do,

549
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,210
you don't have to apologize to me.

550
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,250
Thank you, Mom.

551
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,520
Mom.

552
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,120
I had thought that

553
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,860
as long as I changed,

554
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,680
the problem between Haikuo and me would be solved.

555
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,680
But you were right.

556
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,980
If the problem between Haikuo and his father

557
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,800
can't be soloved,

558
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,000
the issue of values between us

559
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,150
will never be settled.

560
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,720
But what should I do?

561
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,530
I really like him.

562
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,770
I really like him so much.

563
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,120
You're back.

564
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,880
I'm back.

565
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,640
Come on.

566
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:30,920
I'm exhausted.

567
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,980
How was Haikuo?

568
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,020
He didn't cry.

569
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,810
He was neither angry nor sad.

570
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,050
How was that possible?

571
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,200
Both Chen Shi and I thought that he was just acing tough.

572
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,060
We wanted to have a drink with him.

573
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,670
After a drink, it was okay for him to tell us

574
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,070
his true feelings or express his emotions.

575
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,020
But in the end, when Chen Shi got drunk,

576
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,220
he was not even drunk.

577
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,720
Did you have a drink?

578
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,920
Just a little.

579
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,360
You're so tired today.

580
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,800
Go take a shower.

581
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,740
I'll give you a massage after the shower

582
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,010
so that you can relax.

583
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,260
You're so nice.

584
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,990
I've put your clothes in the washroom.

585
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,430
Okay. Thank you.

586
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,330
So you've finished taking a shower?

587
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:33,890
Yes.

588
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,740
Come on. Go to bed.

589
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,160
Let me give you a massage.

590
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,880
Okay.

591
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,690
No.

592
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,680
Not lying on your stomach.

593
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,880
Just lie on your back.

594
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,360
I have to lie on my back?

595
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,080
Lie on your back.

596
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,450
Let me help you.

597
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,010
This is my new massage method.

598
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,660
This is the only shop, and there are no other branches at all.

599
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,380
Come on.

600
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,810
Put on the eyeshade.

601
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,910
Why do I have to put on the eyeshade?

602
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,310
Because if you can't see,

603
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,390
you can focus on enjoying the massage

604
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,270
so that your whole body can relax

605
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,270
and you'll fall asleep easily.

606
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,850
Come on.

607
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,490
I've put it on.

608
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,490
Let's start.

609
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,570
Do you feel comfortable?

610
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,540
Yes.

611
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,920
I'll massage your legs now.

612
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,570
What are you doing?

613
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,290
I'm massaging your legs.

614
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,510
Don't move.

615
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,930
Relax.

616
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,350
Do you feel comfortable?

617
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,710
Elly is such a gentle

618
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,590
and beautiful woman.

619
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,020
If I keep resisting it,

620
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,090
it'll be such a disappointment to myself.

621
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,630
Michael Zhao.

622
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,060
Be a real man for once.

623
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,920
Have some beef.

624
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,310
[Transfer it to the trash can]

625
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,180
So this is really the end of it?

626
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,710
[It has been transferred to the trash can]

627
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,240
Michael Zhao!

628
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,530
When did you leave last night?

629
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,880
You look

630
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,040
so pink today.

631
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,090
It's early in the morning.

632
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,490
Let's not be so intimate.

633
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,860
We're boyfriend and girlfriend.

634
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,320
What's wrong with it if we're a bit intimate?

635
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,180
How come Michael Zhao has become so manly?

636
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,470
But I'll feel shy.

637
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,200
I can't believe that Elly will feel shy.

638
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,640
It's unbelievable.

639
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,750
I have to go first.

640
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,570
I'll bring the breakfast upstairs for you later.

641
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,570
Okay.

642
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,840
Are you Michael Zhao?

643
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,080
Michael Zhao.

644
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,570
I'm Michael Zhao in love.

645
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,370
How come you've changed so much?

646
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,490
Tall guy, come and help me.

647
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,120
Tall guy?

648
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,840
Me?

649
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,070
What are these?

650
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,180
These are

651
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,810
the breakfasts I'm going to give to all the people of our company.

652
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,650
My purpose is to celebrate that Elly and I have been together

653
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,660
for 12 days, 6 hours, 58 minutes and 20 seconds.

654
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,620
I'll entrust this task to you.

655
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,120
You'll entrust it to me?

656
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,950
How am I supposed to carry so many boxes?

657
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,750
Michael Zhao!

658
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,450
What's this?

659
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,450
It's the layoff list.

660
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,690
To be honest,

661
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,700
the business of our company has been bad recently.

662
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,680
I thought we could get through the crisis

663
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,280
after receiving this order.

664
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,290
It looks like

665
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,640
we can't get through the crisis.

666
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,510
Sir,

667
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,410
although I've broken up with Haikuo,

668
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,740
I will keep the promise

669
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,100
which I've made to you.

670
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,090
I will try my best

671
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,090
to prevent President Wang from cancelling the order.

672
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,570
Are you confident that you can do that?

673
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,350
Yes, I am.

674
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,400
Please trust me.

675
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,210
Okay.

676
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,400
I'll just give you half a month.

677
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,010
If you need any help,

678
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,240
just tell me anytime.

679
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,450
Sir,

680
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,960
I only have one request.

681
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,240
Go ahead.

682
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,950
Don't deduct my full-attendance bonus if I ask for leave.

683
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,170
[Preview]

684
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,420
Haikuo and I have broken up.

685
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,970
It looks like I overestimated them when I made a bet that

686
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,560
they would be together for half a year.

687
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,490
We want to share our happiness

688
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,220
with everyone.

689
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,740
Let's start with Haikuo and Keke.

690
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,170
Five hundred thousand NT dollars?

691
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,950
I know you long for the feeling of being needed.

692
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,370
But even after you lend money to them,

693
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,170
your mother won't love you more

694
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,160
because of this.

695
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,760
You can think that I'm quite stupid and silly.

696
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,060
You can break up with me.

697
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,060
I won't blame you.

698
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,030
Keke doesn't love you anymore.

699
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,600
There's no need to see each other again.

700
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,800
We'd better never see each other again.

701
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,790
How could this happen?
