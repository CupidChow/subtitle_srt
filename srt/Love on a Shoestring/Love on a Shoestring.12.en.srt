[Episode 12]

4
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,320
Yuanchong, what do you want to tell me?

5
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,250
Qianqian.

6
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,370
I know you like me.

7
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,350
But...

8
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,980
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,070
You are a good girl.

10
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,960
I don't deserve you.

11
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,370
Why not?

12
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,680
You're so good and kind.

13
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm not good enough.

14
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,670
It's all my problem.

15
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,720
I see.

16
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,340
It's okay.

17
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,490
I'll become bad.

18
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,180
You deserve me then.

19
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,930
Well. What are you doing?

20
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,470
I want to take a photo

21
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,330
and send it to the mailbox of the Environmental Protection Bureau.

22
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,600
I want to report this shop

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,400
and accuse it of having a dirty and bad environment.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,470
I'll slander this shop.

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,329
Then it won't be able to continue.

26
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,700
Well.

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,760
Is this bad enough?

28
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,810
Bad.

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,790
This is too bad.

30
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,600
Yuanchong, stop her, okay?

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,329
It's not that I'm not good enough for you.

32
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,120
It's...

33
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,840
It's...

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,890
My mom doesn't allow us to be together.

35
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,140
Your mom?

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,150
Yes.

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,560
Hello?

38
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,980
Mrs. Li.

39
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,880
I'm Qianqian.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,100
Yuanchong said you don't like me.

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,510
Is that true?

42
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,190
Hold on a second.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,300
Your mom wants to talk to you.

44
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,280
How do you know my mom?

45
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,860
We often do group buying together.

46
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,360
Hello, it's me.

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,870
No.

48
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,630
This...

49
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,930
Well.

50
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,060
I made it up.

52
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,370
I got it.

53
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,530
I'll apologize to her.

54
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,900
My mom wants me to apologize to you.

55
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,920
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,290
She asked me to tell you

57
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,560
she doesn't hate you at all.

58
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,660
And she likes you very much.

59
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,410
Okay, I got it.

60
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,209
It's okay.

61
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,130
Actually,

62
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,090
I knew there was no future between us.

63
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,860
Future?

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,830
Yuanchong.

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,100
I don't care at all.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,300
My motto

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,200
is to live in the moment.

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,330
I don't look forward to the future at all.

69
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,750
But my future is Jiali.

70
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,909
She is the only gift I've received

71
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,570
in my life's loyalty program.

72
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,650
Good.

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,330
Well said. You have guts.

74
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,470
This is a real man.

75
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,990
Yuanchong, stop her!

76
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,440
What do you want?

77
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
Come at me.

78
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,110
I just want to ask her a question.

79
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,570
Excuse me,

80
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,330
do you like Li Yuanchong?

81
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,330
I don't like him.

82
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,880
She said she doesn't like you.

83
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,490
That means I still have hope.

84
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,800
She doesn't like Li Yuanchong.

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,190
I like Li Yuanchong.

86
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,250
-She doesn't like Li Yuanchong.
-She's so powerful.

87
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,260
She is the one who was rejected.

88
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,540
Yet in the end, Yuanchong is the one

89
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,890
who got hurt.

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,340
Li Yuanchong.

91
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,880
She doesn't like Li Yuanchong.

92
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,460
I like...

93
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,720
You can't

94
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,100
come in here unless you're an employee.

95
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,970
I know.

96
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,960
Don't worry.

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,760
I'm already an employee here.

98
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,740
You're going to work here?

99
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,530
Yes.

100
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,770
The store has always been short of hands.

101
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,090
That's why I'm here.

102
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,440
I look forward to working with you.

103
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,050
Okay.

104
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,760
I hope you were honest

105
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,409
about not liking Yuanchong.

106
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,200
Don't play with Yuanchong's feelings

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
and pretend to be hard to get.

108
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,740
I hate two-minded women.

109
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,860
Are you threatening me?

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,540
If what you said is from the bottom of your heart,

111
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,130
then how come my words

112
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,370
are a threat?

113
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,340
From now on,

114
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,590
I will try my best to pursue Yuanchong.

115
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,900
This steak is crispy but tender inside.

116
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,270
It'll taste good

117
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,790
with a little pepper salt.

118
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,400
Do you want shrimp?

119
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,930
I'll serve you if you want.

120
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,890
If you hurt your...

121
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,010
Delicate!

122
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,310
Delicate fingers,

123
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,370
it'll be bad.

124
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,570
Let me peel it for you.

125
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,570
This enoki mushroom

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,580
is

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,420
delicious.

128
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,080
If you want any vegetables,

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,580
just let me know.

130
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Thank you.

131
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,670
I'll grill some meat for you.

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,890
I'll catch some shrimp for you.

133
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,970
I'll go

134
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,250
pick some vegetables.

135
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,450
The three of them seem weird.

136
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,700
Do they?

137
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,400
A beautiful woman

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,930
is naturally to be the focus of the attention.

139
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,930
Why do I feel

140
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,410
they are up to something?

141
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,410
I know.

142
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,130
What do you know?

143
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,810
It must be the magic of this Love Forest.

144
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,970
I knew it.

145
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,110
Single men and women can find love

146
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,930
in this forest.

147
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,250
I'd better walk more around the forest.

148
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,800
Bye.

149
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,790
You just left like that?

150
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,100
How's that possible?

151
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,550
There's no magic!

152
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,940
What are you two doing?

153
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,270
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

154
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,510
Why did Katy leave?

155
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,260
I’ll go find her.

156
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,130
Is it good?

157
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,280
Yes.

158
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,510
Do you want some shrimp?

159
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,470
No.

160
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,800
I don't have delicate hands.

161
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll eat Taro.

162
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,910
I have a question for you.

163
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,820
Go ahead.

164
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
You live in the same room as Elly.

165
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,040
Is there anything special about her?

166
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,560
Are you asking me about Elly?

167
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,270
Yes.

168
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,210
Elly.

169
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,390
Haikuo has something to ask you.

170
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,150
Keke.

171
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,650
Keke.

172
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,330
What do you want to ask me?

173
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,250
Nothing.

174
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,000
Can I ask you?

175
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,560
About what?

176
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,740
What do you think about first

177
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,780
when barbecuing?

178
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,790
Do you know what I think about first?

179
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:42,970
What?

180
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,990
I think about you first.

181
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,330
Do you feel hot?

182
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,510
I'm thinking about you.

183
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,190
Keke.

184
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,090
Why are you angry?

185
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,860
I'm not angry.

186
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,960
Yes, you are.

187
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,070
I'm not angry.

188
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,850
Stop pulling me.

189
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,220
Go to your Elly.

190
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,800
So you are unhappy because

191
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,900
I cared about Elly?

192
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,070
I'm not unhappy.

193
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,770
Why should I be unhappy?

194
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,780
I'm not unhappy.

195
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,700
You're jealous.

196
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,880
I'm not jealous.

197
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,060
You fell in love with me.

198
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,420
I...

199
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,150
What are you talking about?

200
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,440
I...

201
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,130
Have you been influenced by Michael Zhao

202
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,000
because you've been with him for too long

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,030
and it made you feel good about yourself?

204
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,630
No.

205
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,510
You are jealous.

206
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,050
I'm not jealous.

207
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,350
I rejected you before.

208
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,030
But you are jealous.

209
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,350
Why would I be jealous?

210
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,200
Who am I jealous of?

211
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,900
Elly.

212
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,820
That's because

213
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,200
she and I never get along.

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
You keep asking me about her.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,610
I don't know.

216
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,040
Of course, I'm annoyed.

217
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,430
I...

218
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,670
I...

219
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,680
I won't like you anyway.

220
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,270
Do you think he'll believe you

221
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,530
if you say it like that?

222
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,060
I think he will.

223
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,360
I think since he's so smart,

224
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,680
he'll find something.

225
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,350
No way.

226
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,340
But...

227
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,240
Why are you so resistant to him?

228
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,370
Don't you think he's nice?

229
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,640
He's reliable

230
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,060
and mature.

231
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,530
It doesn't matter if you fall in love with him.

232
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,830
It matters.

233
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,240
He can spend 52,000 NTD in one night.

234
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,590
52,000!

235
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,810
But he's a rich second generation.

236
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,810
His family is rich,

237
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,370
and he himself can earn a lot of money.

238
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,230
There's nothing wrong with that.

239
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,360
But it has nothing to do

240
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,570
with whether his family is rich or not.

241
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,800
It's our values

242
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,440
are as extreme as the difference

243
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,370
between the North and South Poles.

244
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,900
Jian Keke.

245
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,930
Both the North and South Poles are covered with ice.

246
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,130
They're the same.

247
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,010
If you said that...

248
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,280
Right.

249
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,430
But I mean

250
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,600
our values are too different.

251
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,540
We won't be happy

252
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,470
if we're together.

253
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,540
Let me tell you.

254
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,430
Nothing is absolute in life.

255
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,460
I know

256
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,070
it may be hard for two people in a relationship

257
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,730
with different values.

258
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,130
But now that you like him,

259
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,650
then face it.

260
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,100
I think you can definitely find

261
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,610
the balance point.

262
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,330
But our values

263
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,780
are like a seesaw.

264
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,480
It will never balance.

265
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,290
But it's fun to play on a seesaw

266
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,720
with someone you like.

267
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,960
Sun Jiali,

268
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,500
I find you

269
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,160
very good at talking tonight.

270
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,070
It's not that I'm good at talking.

271
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,940
It's someone who got seasick

272
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,560
and became stupid.

273
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,550
Sun Jiali.

274
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,470
Alright.

275
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,360
I just hope

276
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,800
you can listen to the voice in your heart.

277
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,470
The voice in my heart.

278
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,910
At least,

279
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,930
don't make decisions that you'll regret.

280
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,960
It says a hot spring here

281
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,130
can make your skin more delicate and smooth,

282
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,440
promote blood circulation,

283
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,730
soften the keratin,

284
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,570
and accelerate metabolism.

285
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,400
Does it mention how long it's best to soak in the hot spring?

286
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,930
About 15 minutes.

287
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,820
So...

288
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,810
Rry.

289
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,630
Yu Fen.

290
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,540
Yu Fen.

291
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,369
What are you doing?

292
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,079
I...

293
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm fine.

294
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,390
Let's go soak in the hot spring.

295
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,250
You hate Chen Shi so much?

296
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,569
You kept staring at him the whole time.

297
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,240
No, I didn't.

298
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,510
I don't hate him.

299
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,340
So this is your taste.

300
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,460
You like girls

301
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,800
of Yu Fen's type?

302
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,160
I don't like her.

303
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,110
Cut it out.

304
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,340
You look like

305
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,670
you're about to drool.

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,640
I've seen too many such expressions.

307
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,620
This is the expression the girls showed

308
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,130
when they saw me.

309
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,140
I dare to guess

310
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
you are in love.

311
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,240
It's not like that.

312
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,540
I don't know.

313
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,410
Every time I look at her,

314
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,960
I can't take my eyes off her.

315
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,830
I can also

316
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,810
hear music.

317
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,950
Music?

318
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,810
What music?

319
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,710
I think it's the theme song.

320
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,680
Really?

321
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,180
Theme song.

322
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,230
Bro,

323
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,500
you're under too much pressure at work.

324
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,380
You misheard.

325
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,300
I've also experienced high work pressure before.

326
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,100
But I didn't have such symptoms.

327
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,400
Then tell me

328
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,930
when this symptom started.

329
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,570
It seemed to start

330
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,350
when we were at the entrance of the forest.

331
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,700
There's a legend in this forest.

332
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,730
I heard that

333
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,040
single men and women

334
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,110
may find their love

335
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,130
after taking a stroll in the forest.

336
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,060
Love Forest.

337
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,940
What's up?

338
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,300
Bro.

339
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,060
Why did you answer the door half-naked?

340
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,630
Why do I

341
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,260
need to wear clothes when sleeping?

342
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,330
Then why

343
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,650
shall I talk to you at the door?

344
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,800
Because

345
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,740
this is my room.

346
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,010
Wang Haikuo.

347
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,410
Mr. Zhao.

348
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,420
Why did you appear in my bed

349
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,900
during your beauty sleep?

350
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,170
My body told me

351
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,700
I should sleep at this hour.

352
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,760
But my mind doesn't allow me to do that.

353
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,940
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,400
Both my mind and body told me

355
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,870
I shouldn't talk to you now

356
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,830
but sleep.

357
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,440
You can sleep,

358
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,390
but you have to promise me one thing.

359
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,050
Ask Elly to go to the Love Forest for me.

360
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,050
I refuse.

361
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,840
I almost lost Keke

362
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,230
because of this last time.

363
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,490
It won't happen again.

364
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,570
Please.

365
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,900
Except for you to help me,

366
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,230
I have no other way.

367
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,370
Get lost.

368
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,310
I don't care.

369
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,670
If you don't promise me today,

370
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,630
I won't leave.

371
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,040
Chen Shi.

372
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,140
If he sleeps here today,

373
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
he'll sleep on the same bed with you.

374
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
This bed is already too small for me.

375
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:35,890
No.

376
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,040
I don't want to leave.

377
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,440
So manly!

378
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,920
Help!

379
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,800
Help!

380
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,060
No!

381
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,870
My eyeshades.

382
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,470
I didn't bring my eyeshades.

383
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,380
No.

384
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,830
I want to go home.

385
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,280
Is it that serious?

386
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,980
You don't understand.

387
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,440
What are you doing?

388
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,630
Are you asking me?

389
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,950
Who else could I ask?

390
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,380
You're the only one here.

391
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,430
I want to

392
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,620
go to the bathroom.

393
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,050
Jian Keke.

394
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,200
It's late.

395
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,830
Why are you still up causing trouble?

396
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,140
What do you want?

397
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,140
Wagyu beef.

398
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,370
Lobsters.

399
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,310
What Wagyu beef?

400
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,160
Wagyu beef.

401
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,900
Lobsters.

402
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,560
What Wagyu beef and lobsters?

403
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,560
Wagyu beef.

404
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,140
Lobsters.

405
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,670
Jian Keke, are you still hungry or something?

406
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,100
I'm full.

407
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,640
Time to sleep.

408
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,590
Is she sleepwalking?

409
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,680
Why hasn't Elly shown up yet?

410
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,480
Haikuo!

411
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,910
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

412
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:48,990
No worries.

413
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,380
It's really sunny today.

414
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,030
Aren't you

415
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,190
afraid of getting sunburned?

416
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,700
No, I'm not.

417
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,650
For you,

418
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,550
I'd endure anything.

419
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,930
Thank you.

420
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,300
There's a legend

421
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,080
that this forest can make people fall in love.

422
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,330
Have you heard of it?

423
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,710
Yes.

424
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,710
That's why I invited you all here.

425
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,220
You all?

426
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,010
No, just us.

427
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,660
Weird.

428
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,090
Where are Keke

429
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,180
and Michael Zhao?

430
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,470
Didn't we plan to "bump into each other" here?

431
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,870
What are you looking for?

432
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,540
Let's go.

433
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,280
Where are we now?

434
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,630
How would I know?

435
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,970
How can you not know?

436
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,670
You said

437
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,060
to go this way.

438
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,030
But before that,

439
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,970
I was following

440
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,320
your lead.

441
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,800
So now we can't trust

442
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,530
your directions or mine.

443
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,790
Whose should we trust?

444
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,400
Let's trust technology then!

445
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,070
This compass app

446
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,010
will make sure you never get lost,

447
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,700
whether you're hiking, traveling,

448
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,800
rock climbing, or skiing.

449
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,930
This app

450
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,930
will easily solve

451
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,430
all your lost situations.

452
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,780
No

453
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,760
signal

454
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,570
here.

455
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,480
Oh no!

456
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,910
There's no signal.

457
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,170
What should we do?

458
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,510
How can there be no signal?

459
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,510
Where are we?

460
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,560
Michael Zhao

461
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,180
[Watch out for Bears]

462
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,330
Taiwan

463
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,340
Black

464
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,810
Bear.

465
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,460
They shouldn't be here, right?

466
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,310
No way.

467
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,620
They only appear

468
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,500
at altitudes above 3000 meters

469
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,710
in sparsely populated areas, right?

470
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,590
Yes, I think so.

471
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,100
After confirming everything,

472
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,440
we'll do a final inventory check

473
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,700
and we can call it a day.

474
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,710
Got it.

475
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,820
No problem.

476
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,780
I'm okay with it.

477
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,100
The convenience store tasks

478
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,370
are varied and complex.

479
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,440
If you forget something

480
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,740
or don't know how to do it,

481
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,670
you can ask me

482
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,760
or request my help.

483
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,270
No worries,

484
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,260
I've got it.

485
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,050
We receive deliveries at least three times a day.

486
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,400
Refrigerated items usually arrive in the morning,

487
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,870
and frozen items at night.

488
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,130
The first thing to do when you start your shift

489
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,100
is to check the cash register

490
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,040
to ensure there's enough change

491
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,170
for customers.

492
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:23,700
Then

493
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,530
check for soon-to-expire food,

494
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,060
restock items,

495
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,160
and make sure the temperature

496
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,620
of the machines is normal.

497
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,510
You really remember everything.

498
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,330
It's not that hard.

499
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,010
This means we won't need to

500
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,290
work the same shift in the future, right?

501
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,870
Yuanchong, let me help you.

502
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,950
No, I can do it myself.

503
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,110
Don't you need to learn new things from Jiali?

504
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,330
I've remembered everything.

505
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:52,900
Right?

506
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,000
Qianqian is a fast learner.

507
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,300
It's okay. I can do it myself.

508
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,230
Yuanchong.

509
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,930
You don't trust me?

510
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,080
That really hurt my feelings.

511
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,810
I'm going to punish you.

512
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,630
You have to watch a movie with me tonight.

513
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,440
I can't. I have plans tonight.

514
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,220
Then,

515
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,640
how about on your day off?

516
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,800
I have plans on my day off too.

517
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,600
Then whenever you're free,

518
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,660
I'll be available.

519
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,340
I don't have any free time.

520
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,400
Yuanchong.

521
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,210
Are you avoiding me?

522
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,490
No.

523
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm really busy.

524
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,640
So, I don't have time.

525
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,830
Busy?

526
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,430
Busy with what?

527
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,330
Well...

528
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,520
Well...

529
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,350
You are injured!

530
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,730
You...

531
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,130
You got burned,

532
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,310
didn't you?

533
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,300
It's not a burn.

534
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,190
No?

535
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,560
This is clearly a burn.

536
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,950
Don't lie to me.

537
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,800
You...

538
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,290
How did you burn yourself?

539
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,860
Fine.

540
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,800
I accidentally burned myself

541
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,860
cooking instant noodles last night.

542
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Instant noodles?

543
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,370
Let me see.

544
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,750
Jiali, I have to go now.

545
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,260
Bye bye.

546
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,310
Yuanchong.

547
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,530
What's wrong?

548
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,660
Need any more help?

549
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
Apply this burn ointment

550
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,090
twice a day,

551
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,190
morning and night.

552
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,090
It helps prevent scarring.

553
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,310
You should be more careful.

554
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,350
Seeing you like this makes me worry.

555
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,410
Yuanchong.

556
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,920
Yuanchong.

557
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,900
Yuanchong.

558
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Yuanchong!

559
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,200
Take this.

560
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,100
My grandma bought me a lot of them.

561
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,230
Remember to use it.

562
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,310
I have to get back to work.

563
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,700
My legs are sore.

564
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,940
I need a break.

565
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,600
Okay.

566
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,560
Sit down and take a break then.

567
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,100
Okay.

568
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,100
Are you okay?

569
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,740
Yes.

570
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,860
Can you massage my legs?

571
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,510
They're really sore.

572
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,610
Okay.

573
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,920
Where did Keke

574
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,260
and Michael Zhao go?

575
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,290
Alone with Haikuo,

576
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,780
this is my chance.

577
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,230
I need to do something

578
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,400
to get closer to him.

579
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,409
My hands are dirty.

580
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
I'm going to wash them over there.

581
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,190
Stop it.

582
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,580
Stop it, Haikuo.

583
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,070
Stop splashing me.

584
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,950
It's so cold!

585
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,030
No!

586
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,980
No!

587
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,340
No!

588
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,660
Haikuo, no!

589
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,230
No!

590
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,020
Elly.

591
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,020
What are you doing?

592
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,250
Putting on

593
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,740
a little water show

594
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,790
for you.

595
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,520
Do you like it?

596
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,620
No.

597
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,610
Why?

598
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,360
It's all censored.

599
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,280
Censored?

600
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,870
Who did it?

601
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,440
How about now?

602
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,250
Happy?

603
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,930
Very.

604
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,920
But

605
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,380
I want more than this.

606
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,360
I also want

607
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,070
deeper interaction.

608
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,320
Elly, what are you...

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,130
Why are you smiling?

610
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,790
Nothing.

611
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,070
Your massage feels great. Thank you.

612
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,930
My hands are dirty.

613
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,640
I'll go wash them over there.

614
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,640
Slow down.

615
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,520
I finally found you.

616
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,030
I finally found you guys!

617
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,080
What happened?

618
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:52,840
There are...

619
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,360
There are bears.

620
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,390
Bears!

621
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,320
Run faster!

622
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,770
A bear warning again?

623
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,450
It can't

624
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,290
be the same one.

625
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,970
No.

626
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,180
-Hurry up.
-No.

627
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,740
Michael Zhao.

628
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,190
I can't run anymore.

629
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,130
Sorry.

630
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,310
It's okay.

631
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,000
You...

632
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,220
Is your head okay?

633
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,840
Don't faint here.

634
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,720
I can't carry you down the mountain.

635
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,620
You...

636
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,030
We've survived

637
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,980
a disaster.

638
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,240
We're like

639
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,250
new people now.

640
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,960
I feel like I was reborn too.

641
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,080
Do you think we can make a lot of money now?

642
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,400
How can there be bears here?

643
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,530
Bear or no bear,

644
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,370
we need to get out of here now.

645
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,770
No!

646
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,500
No, we can't go.

647
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,360
My water show isn't finished yet.

648
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,130
What show?

649
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,130
No, I mean

650
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,170
you guys can go ahead.

651
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,830
I want to keep exploring the forest with Haikuo.

652
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,640
What are you doing?

653
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,080
You hurt your foot.

654
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,810
How did you know?

655
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,500
I have eyes.

656
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,110
It's okay. I can walk on my own.

657
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,260
So cool.

658
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,790
Yeah.

659
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,990
A man's coolness

660
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,630
comes from being tough like this.

661
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,060
Isn't he cool?

662
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,670
You'd better stay away from me.

663
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,120
I'm not in a good mood.

664
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,550
It's okay.

665
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,280
Elly,

666
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,710
I can be very tough too.

667
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:01,970
Do you need me to carry you?

668
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,110
Let me help.

669
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:03,970
You're wearing high heels.

670
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,310
-It's hard to walk.
-No need.

671
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,150
Let me carry you.

672
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,910
No.

673
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,450
Let me carry you on my back.

674
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,380
-No.
-Let me show you my toughness!

675
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,340
Today's bakery lesson is

676
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,640
about how to make bear cupcakes.

677
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,260
Look, aren't they cute?

678
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,930
You have flour, water, eggs,

679
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,950
and decorations for the bear's eyes and nose.

680
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,090
I'll teach you

681
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,230
step by step.

682
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,320
Miss,

683
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,780
baking is a very

684
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,140
important dream for me.

685
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,030
Can you give me another chance?

686
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,130
Can you please let me go?

687
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,220
Dreams are dreams.

688
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,160
Let them stay that way.

689
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,430
Give up, okay?

690
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,730
Jiali.

691
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,990
Why did you come to find me?

692
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,360
If you can follow me,

693
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,870
I can follow you too.

694
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,100
Then,

695
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,600
why did you suddenly want to follow me?

696
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,290
I can tell from your burn mark

697
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,820
that you got burned by a metal tray.

698
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,430
Why do you want to learn baking?

699
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,580
Keke said

700
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,080
you want to open a bakery.

701
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,260
So?

702
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,830
I want to help you fulfill your dream.

703
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,080
You don't have to do this.

704
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,130
It's not about whether I need to do it or not.

705
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,320
I want to do this.

706
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,760
That's why I signed up for the bakery classes.

707
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,050
Although I'm clumsy

708
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,150
and not very talented,

709
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,410
and the teacher just tried to discourage me,

710
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,610
I've

711
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,900
decided

712
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,160
to pursue this path

713
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,390
no matter how hard it is

714
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,870
or what it costs.

715
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,780
Your dream

716
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,180
is my mission.

717
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,900
I'll

718
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:22,970
see it through

719
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,300
without compromise

720
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,310
or giving up

721
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,920
[Preview]

722
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,140
I really like you

723
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,260
for being like this.

724
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,830
I agree with you on it.

725
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,340
What do you mean?

726
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,020
He

727
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,900
wants to steal my Keke.

728
00:44:59,010 --> 00:44:59,950
No way.

729
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,400
Elly,

730
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,080
stop escaping, okay?

731
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,490
About what I asked

732
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,590
the other day,

733
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,090
have you thought it over?

734
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,190
We can get married first and then try to get along.

735
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,950
Marriage is about reality,

736
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,050
benefits,

737
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,990
and eugenics.

738
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,780
I've decided to confess to Haikuo.

739
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,080
Why are you looking at me like this?
