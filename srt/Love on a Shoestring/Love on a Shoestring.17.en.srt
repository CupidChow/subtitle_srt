You're welcome to have a taste.

192
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,470
You can come and have a taste.

193
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,730
The handmade cupcakes are very delicious.

194
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,350
What's wrong with Haikuo?

195
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,790
Someone is waiting for him anxiously.

196
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,060
He should come here as soon as possible.

197
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Who?

198
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,420
Who?

199
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,440
It's me.

200
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,790
I'm waiting for him anxiously.

201
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,820
I'm waiting for my boyfriend

202
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,360
very anxiously.

203
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,590
What? Are you jealous?

204
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,420
If you are jealous,

205
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,800
there is a man over there.

206
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,200
The handmade cupcakes are very delicious.

207
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,720
He really is a good man.

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,510
Consider it.

209
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,110
Jian Keke.

210
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,490
Yuanchong.

211
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,220
Great! Keep going!

212
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,250
The handmade cupcakes are very delicious.

213
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,040
Elly,

214
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,980
everything sold on this floor is for men.

215
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,230
Why are we here?

216
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,330
That's right.

217
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,320
Shouldn't you go to the cosmetics shops on the first floor

218
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,580
or the boutiques on the second floor to invest in yourself?

219
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,710
You're right.

220
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,680
I am investing in myself.

221
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,870
How can you invest in yourself in a men's clothing store?

222
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,750
I can.

223
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,910
Because today, I'm investing in...

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,940
love.

225
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,370
Elly.

226
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,290
I know you suffered a significant blow,

227
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,440
but it's time for you to face the reality.

228
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,010
Yes.

229
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,090
So I'm facing it bravely now.

230
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,190
Then you should leave him as soon as possible.

231
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,480
I

232
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,010
can't leave him.

233
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,690
I need to create opportunities for myself.

234
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,020
Look what he did to you.

235
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,890
You still want to create opportunities?

236
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,750
Elly, keep your mind clear.

237
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,190
He is a scumbag.

238
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,940
Who said he's a scumbag?

239
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,920
He's the most handsome,

240
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,650
courageous, confident,

241
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,480
and tasteful man I've ever seen.

242
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,180
Especially when I was in danger,

243
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,130
he showed up in front of me

244
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,440
and won my heart

245
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,480
like a superman.

246
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,480
Bastard!

247
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,840
Let's go home.

248
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,430
Yu Fen.

249
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,010
Where is the temple mentioned

250
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,890
by your grandma last time?

251
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,500
Temple?

252
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,610
Why are you asking?

253
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,340
We should take Elly there to calm her down.

254
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,620
Look. She has been hurt by Eric so badly

255
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,170
that she's acting strange.

256
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,470
Eric?

257
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,400
Who's Eric?

258
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,490
Why did you mention that scumbag?

259
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,980
If you were not talking about Eric,

260
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,510
who were you talking about?

261
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,040
Who else

262
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,320
has so many advantages

263
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,520
except Michael Zhao?

264
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,800
-Michael Zhao?
-Michael Zhao?

265
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,160
Elly,

266
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,190
so you're buying a present

267
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,520
to confess your love to Michael Zhao?

268
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,310
No.

269
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,420
A woman

270
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,750
who gives her all in love

271
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,090
is at a disadvantage.

272
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,070
I

273
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,310
fell in love with Michael Zhao first,

274
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,950
but

275
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,530
I want him to take the initiative to confess his love to me.

276
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,240
This is so scary.

277
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,290
Looks like we should go to Grandma's place

278
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,620
to calm ourselves down.

279
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,770
[Modifying clothes without restrictions on the style, 30 NT dollars per piece]

280
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,160
Come.

281
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,120
Buy one piece of clothing and get the modification service for free.

282
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,420
Come and take a look.

283
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,340
It'll be a pity if you don't come quickly.

284
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,250
Madam.

285
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,560
Does it really cost only 30 NT dollars

286
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,150
to modify one piece of clothing here?

287
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,720
Yes.

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,590
Great.

289
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,860
I happen to have some clothes

290
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,060
that need to be modified.

291
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Wait a minute.

292
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,740
Okay.

293
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,580
Great.

294
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,790
Sir, Madam, please give me a hand.

295
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,720
Sorry.

296
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,100
Are you here to wreck the stall?

297
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,720
Here.

298
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,990
All of these need to be modified?

299
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,590
Yes.

300
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,440
I still have more than ten pieces in my car.

301
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,310
I'm going to bring them here now.

302
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,110
Wait a minute.

303
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Wait.

304
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,890
Why do I think you look so familiar?

305
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,890
You're the one

306
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,930
who came to our house

307
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,360
to take Keke to the wedding that day

308
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,750
but... failed.

309
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,410
Right?

310
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,640
Yes.

311
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,340
This man is so stingy.

312
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,390
No wonder Keke didn't choose him.

313
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,570
Exactly.

314
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,310
Choose?

315
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,660
Yes.

316
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,750
I chose these clothes myself.

317
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,740
Good.

318
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,740
Even you are already here.

319
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,900
Why hasn't Haikuo come here yet?

320
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,920
Keke.

321
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,600
-Mr. Jian, Mrs. Jian.
-Hello.

322
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Don't you think it took you too long?

323
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,410
Sorry, I'm late.

324
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,520
You want to use a small cake from Jiali's stall

325
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,430
to placate me.

326
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,950
No.

327
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,690
Look carefully.

328
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,620
This is a customized cupcake I asked Jiali to make for you.

329
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,050
It's exclusive to you.

330
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,170
Thank you.

331
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,120
But where exactly did you go?

332
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
What took you so long?

333
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,160
I went to withdraw some money.

334
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,240
Did you withdraw a lot of money again?

335
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,820
We were late

336
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,000
because we withdrew 120,000 NT dollars

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,390
from a nearby ATM.

338
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,690
If it weren't for the withdrawal limit,

339
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,320
Haikuo would have withdrawn 200,000 NT dollars.

340
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,450
120,000 NT dollars?

341
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,150
Haikuo,

342
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,360
this is just a small charity event.

343
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
Why did you withdraw so much money?

344
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,040
That's right.

345
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,990
It won't cost us 120,000 NT dollars even if we pay for all of these.

346
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,730
Mr. Jian, Mrs. Jian, don't worry.

347
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,190
This sum of money

348
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,260
is part of

349
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,570
my flexible deposit for this month.

350
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,490
I think using it to do charity is worthwhile.

351
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,090
Yes, it's worthwhile.

352
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,790
But...

353
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,870
Fine. Since you've withdrawn the money...

354
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,680
Fine.

355
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,360
Since you came...

356
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,760
to do charity,

357
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,680
start from our stall,

358
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,450
okay?

359
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,530
Come.

360
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,160
Start from our stall.

361
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,750
Go.

362
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,250
Come.

363
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,670
Mrs. Jian, please take care of these.

364
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,160
-We donated all these.
-Okay, just go.

365
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,650
These are for the bazaar. They're all cheap.

366
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,690
Baby.

367
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,020
Are you worried

368
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,329
Haikuo is a big spender?

369
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,900
No.

370
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,460
After all, the money was earned by him.

371
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,609
It's his business no matter how he wants to spend it.

372
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,859
I'm just thinking

373
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,339
if it's good for him to spend money like this.

374
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,089
Haikuo,

375
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,310
it's really great that you want

376
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,770
to do charity.

377
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,490
But you

378
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,820
withdrew all your flexible deposit

379
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,150
in one stroke.

380
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,890
You withdrew all of it in one go.

381
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,510
I don't think it's a good idea, right?

382
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,220
No, Mr. Jian.

383
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,790
This sum of money is just some of it.

384
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,850
I know.

385
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,460
You...

386
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,030
You should

387
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,990
divide the money evenly

388
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,520
and be frugal.

389
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,730
I don't know if it's good for him

390
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,150
to spend money like this.

391
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,750
But since you decided to be together,

392
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,460
it has become inevitable that you'll face problems

393
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,090
caused by your different values in the future.

394
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,290
You need to compromise with each other.

395
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
It depends on...

396
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,880
your wisdom.

397
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:07,980
Okay.

398
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,810
-Thank you, Mr. Jian.
-Mr. Jian, Mrs. Jian.

399
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,610
Mr. Wang bought these cupcakes.

400
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,560
They are very delicious.

401
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,720
Really?

402
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,010
Mr. Jian, here.

403
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,010
This... is quite cute.

404
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,680
Is it good to spend money like this?

405
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,560
You can eat it.

406
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,510
Eat it while it's fresh.

407
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,500
Eat.

408
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,290
We...

409
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,530
sold all of them today.

410
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,300
Yes.

411
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,610
Thank you, Jiali.

412
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,810
Your business was booming.

413
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,110
You sold all of them.

414
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,200
I wanted to help you.

415
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,410
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

416
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,510
Why are you here?

417
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,050
Participating in a bazaar is a good thing.

418
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,780
I shouldn't have refused to participate

419
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,690
just because Jiali and I have different opinions.

420
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,270
Jiali,

421
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,670
I'm sorry.

422
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,420
I was the one who said

423
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,120
we should be reasonable

424
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,050
instead of being emotional,

425
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,160
but I failed to do so.

426
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,260
It's okay.

427
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,570
You are not obligated to help us.

428
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,930
This is for you.

429
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,550
Yuanchong and I specially saved it for you.

430
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,080
Yuanchong?

431
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,760
Yuanchong.

432
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,570
Don't worry.

433
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,930
Jiali made this.

434
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,620
So it's not overcooked at all.

435
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,620
I just

436
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,940
packaged it.

437
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,470
I didn't say anything.

438
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,080
Also,

439
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,410
I want to thank you.

440
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,340
What you said to me

441
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,040
made me realize

442
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,890
I imposed my values

443
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,670
on Yuanchong.

444
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,210
No matter what one's dream is,

445
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,800
or whether one has a dream or not,

446
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,110
it's his freedom.

447
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,870
Right?

448
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,680
It turns out you're not a weak woman

449
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,940
who can't withstand criticism from others.

450
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,200
You're quite responsible.

451
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,860
Awesome.

452
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,930
This cake looks very delicious.

453
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,960
Eat it as soon as possible.

454
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,620
It's very delicious. Jiali made it.

455
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,030
Are you sure you didn't touch it?

456
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,490
I really didn't.

457
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,390
I want it

458
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,850
to be slightly pointed.

459
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,500
Slightly pointed?

460
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,740
-Yes.
-Do you feel uncomfortable?

461
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,280
No, I feel good. Thank you.

462
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,520
Which color

463
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,930
is more popular these days?

464
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,110
[The Art of War]

465
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,210
Elly,

466
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,560
why are you reading The Art of War?

467
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,880
Because I want to find a strategy

468
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,390
that can make Michael Zhao

469
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,580
fall in love with me

470
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,140
and confess his love to me.

471
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,640
Then why are you reading The Art of War?

472
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,040
It's too old-fashioned.

473
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,720
Shouldn't you read books

474
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,350
like Efficient Ways to Win a Man's Heart

475
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,250
or Ways to Flirt with a Man?

476
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,310
Why are you reading The Art of War?

477
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,650
Considering what I'm capable of,

478
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,380
do you think it's necessary for me to read those superficial books?

479
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,540
But...

480
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,910
well,

481
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,190
is your love for Michael Zhao sincere?

482
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:20,850
Yes.

483
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,180
When did you

484
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,750
fall in love with Michael Zhao?

485
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,350
Yeah. It's too sudden.

486
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,660
I have no clue at all.

487
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,070
My love for him grew little by little

488
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,370
and has gradually taken root in my heart.

489
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,580
From the moment he defended me,

490
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,210
I started to care about him sincerely.

491
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,820
What's so funny about sleeping with eyes open?

492
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,070
Who said we have to sleep with eyes closed?

493
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,000
As long as we feel comfortable and can fall asleep,

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,200
sleeping with eyes open is fine, right?

495
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,030
We shouldn't be restricted by worldly rules.

496
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,920
Then, when I saw him

497
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,710
buy all the vegetables from an old lady,

498
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,580
his kindness touched me deeply.

499
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,050
Lastly,

500
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,080
when he saved me

501
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,920
from Eric,

502
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,510
I fully realized

503
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,280
I've fallen for him.

504
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,480
I can't help myself.

505
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,670
Now, there is one more couple

506
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,350
under the spell of office romance.

507
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,980
What's the point of reading the book?

508
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,040
It's useless if you don't have a chance to put the strategy into practice.

509
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,740
I know.

510
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,980
So,

511
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,710
I need to figure out a way

512
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,360
to ask him out

513
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,550
to put it into practice.

514
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,840
But in my opinion,

515
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,780
to deal with someone like Michael Zhao,

516
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,380
you should use team tactics

517
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,180
to lower his guard

518
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,520
and destroy the defense in his heart.

519
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,050
And then you can launch a single attack.

520
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,810
In that way can you have a higher chance of winning.

521
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,220
What ideas do you have?

522
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,170
The staff of the Business Department

523
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,900
asked us out to have fun previously, didn't they?

524
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,880
This time, let's give them a gift in return

525
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,080
by asking them to have barbecue with us.

526
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,470
I have an idea.

527
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,810
Will you guys help me?

528
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,200
Sure.

529
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,170
Of course.

530
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,750
I've been waiting all day.

531
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,790
Finally, I can

532
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,840
spend time with you alone.

533
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,700
Have you been waiting for this moment all day?

534
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,840
Is it quite obvious?

535
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,680
Seriously?

536
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,640
Yes.

537
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,480
You spent so much money on charity today.

538
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,660
Are you sure it was okay?

539
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,060
There is still some time before we get our salaries next time.

540
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,830
What's wrong?

541
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,080
Since my mom passed away,

542
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,940
no one has ever cared about me like this.

543
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,460
Don't change the subject.

544
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,230
Answer me seriously.

545
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,250
The money I spent today

546
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,810
was allocated specially.

547
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,100
What's more,

548
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,540
I haven't used it up.

549
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,510
That's good.

550
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,010
By the way,

551
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,710
I've arranged the schedule

552
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,970
for our date tomorrow.

553
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,550
Do you want to take a look?

554
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,040
The first destination

555
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,090
is a restaurant?

556
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,640
Because I have free meal vouchers.

557
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,810
After we have lunch,

558
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,350
we can ride a bicycle.

559
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,770
Then we can fly a kite.

560
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,240
If we still have time after that,

561
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,880
we can go shopping

562
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,810
at the second-hand market nearby.

563
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,410
We can get there just by walking.

564
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,420
What do you think?

565
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,890
Is this schedule okay?

566
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,860
It's okay for me.

567
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,540
I've never had such a petty-bourgeoisie date.

568
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,820
It feels quite fresh.

569
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,000
I'll definitely give you an unforgettable experience

570
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,490
to make you fall in love with such a date which has a high cost-performance ratio.

571
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm looking forward to it.

572
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,520
Let's go.

573
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,610
[Friday: Off-price products are on sale.]

574
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,610
[Money-saving Day] [Date Day]

575
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,610
[Travel: Hokkaido]

576
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,510
Today is really a wonderful day.

577
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,790
[Today is a wonderful day.]

578
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,800
All right!

579
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,200
Okay.

580
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,910
It smells good.

581
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,020
My daughter

582
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,150
is dressed so beautifully today.

583
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,610
It feels like

584
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,490
you're shining.

585
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,850
Come on. Turn around and let me take a look.

586
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,700
Just turn around once.

587
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,850
Mom.

588
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,600
I'm counting on you today.

589
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,250
Keep an eye on my dad closely for me.

590
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,170
Don't let him disturb my date.

591
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,510
Everything will be fine.

592
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,560
Okay.

593
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,380
It's your first date.

594
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,150
Check if there's anything

595
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,680
you haven't taken.

596
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,820
-I think I've taken everything.
-Just have a check.

597
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,710
Let me check.

598
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,330
My EasyCard, mobile phone,

599
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,430
wallet, keys...

600
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,610
Lower your voice!

601
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,250
-What's going on?
-Why is she shouting so loud?

602
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,640
Is there an earthquake?

603
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,470
What's the thing that you forgot to take?

604
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,180
Well, where...

605
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,280
Where are my meal vouchers?

606
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,910
What's wrong?

607
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,370
-My meal vouchers.
-Where did you put them?

608
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,110
I remember that I put them in my bag.

609
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,150
What are you looking for?

610
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,260
My meal vouchers.

611
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,300
Meal vouchers? I saw them.

612
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,210
Well...

613
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,650
They were on that tea table.

614
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,050
I saw them yesterday.

615
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,240
There were two vouchers.

616
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,280
I picked them up and take a look.

617
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,570
They seemed to have expired,

618
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,700
so I threw them into that recycling bin

619
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,580
with a large pile of waster paper.

620
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,810
Where is that recycling bin?

621
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,010
The recycling bin...

622
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,610
The recycling....

623
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,890
I gave it to that old lady who collected recyclable materials.

624
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,730
Ma'am!

625
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,370
Wait!

626
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,410
Wait.

627
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,870
Let me look for something.

628
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,790
What are you doing?

629
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,410
All my stuff is here. What are you looking for?

630
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,570
My gosh!

631
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,780
Slow down.

632
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,070
You ran so fast.

633
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,550
Keke.

634
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,040
Have you found them?

635
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,310
No.

636
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,510
You didn't find them?

637
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,080
Just forget it if you didn't find the meal vouchers.

638
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
How can I forget it?

639
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,010
That's my happiness!

640
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,240
Oh no!

641
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,210
I ruined my daughter's happiness.

642
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,110
Let's look for them now.

643
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,340
Come on. Let's help her look for them.

644
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,710
Meal vouchers.

645
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,080
Where are they?

646
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,660
Meal vouchers.

647
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,290
There is some ketchup on the meal vouchers,

648
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,180
and they are on your skirt.

649
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,160
We found them.

650
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,380
There is some ketchup on them.

651
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,520
I think she'll accept it.

652
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,020
What if she doesn't accept it?

653
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,220
Your coffee is ready. Thank you.

654
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,040
I'm sorry.

655
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,720
I think she'll accept it.

656
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,600
It's not a bad thing.

657
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,450
What are you thinking?

658
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,600
Jiali.

659
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,680
Well...

660
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,590
I'm just thinking about

661
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,540
other things.

662
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,790
This is for you.

663
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,910
My grandma made this hangover-relief soup for you.

664
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,090
I don't remember that I had a drink that day.

665
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,420
Did I have a drink later?

666
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,630
Were you really drunk?

667
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,180
You don't even remember

668
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,510
whether you had a drink.

669
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,480
Today,

670
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,120
there are many things which are worth celebrating.

671
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,040
Order as much food as you want, and drink as much as you can.

672
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,820
It's the borough warden's treat.

673
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,020
Thank you.

674
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,550
I want a glass of Long Island Iced Tea, please.

675
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,990
Replace the Long Island Iced Tea with Cola.

676
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,760
You really can't drink much alcohol.

677
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,810
Okay. I'll listen to you.

678
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,330
I want a glass of Cola, please.

679
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,530
Did I talk too much again?

680
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,100
Or did I do something again?

681
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,380
It's okay. Don't worry.

682
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,760
You did well.

683
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,910
But my grandma was still worried that you might be drunk,

684
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,570
so she specially made a bowl of this soup for you.

685
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,720
Thank your grandma for me.

686
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,730
I'll go get changed first.

687
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,440
Remember to drink it when you're free.

688
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:32,990
Okay.

689
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,710
Jiali.

690
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,250
I'll wait for you to get off work today.

691
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,310
Because I have something to tell you.

692
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,950
Okay.

693
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,400
Whether she accepts it or not,

694
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,670
I'll give it try.

695
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,770
Today,

696
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,180
you look very pretty.

697
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,720
Thank you.

698
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,240
You're handsome, too.

699
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,030
Thank you.

700
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,110
Excuse me.

701
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,710
Could you order the food now?

702
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,010
Yes.

703
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,790
I have two set-meal vouchers.

704
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,000
Thank you.

705
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,440
How come there's a

706
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,920
sour and sweet smell?

707
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,460
According to my professional judgment,

708
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,730
it should be ketchup.

709
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,440
[Set-meal Voucher]

710
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,560
Yes.

711
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,590
I accidentally got some ketchup on the meal vouchers.

712
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,820
We'll prepare these two set-meals for you at once.

713
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,550
Thank you.

714
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,160
I have a gift for you.

715
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
This is

716
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,330
a handmade DIY potted plant.

717
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,770
I wanted to buy one.

718
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,650
But...

719
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,010
I thought about it later.

720
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,870
It was more economical to make it by myself,

721
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,200
and it was more sincere.

722
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,260
You're so thoughtful.

723
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,130
You remember everything I said.

724
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,280
I've kept everything

725
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,520
you said in my mind.

726
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,230
You are so thoughtful towards me.

727
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,670
But I want to say sorry to you.

728
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,990
Why do you want to say sorry?

729
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,490
Because actually, those two meal vouchers

730
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,850
were given to me by Chen Shi.

731
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,150
I've never had a meal at this restaurant before,

732
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,480
so I don't know what the customers think of it.

733
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,880
But now, it looks like

734
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,940
it's not very good.

735
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,080
Why does it look like it's not very good?

736
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,140
Because it's meal time now,

737
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,140
but we're the only two customers here.

738
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,150
There's no one else here.

739
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,610
That means the food here doesn't taste good.

740
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,120
Actually,

741
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,980
having no customers doesn't mean that the food here doesn't taste good.

742
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,310
Maybe...

743
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,710
There are other reasons?

744
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,600
People gave very good

745
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,430
comments on our dishes.

746
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,650
There are usually many people.

747
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,750
Especially during holidays,

748
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,980
people can hardly book a table.

749
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,980
There are no other customers here today because you two

750
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,300
have booked the whole restaurant.

751
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,040
We've booked the whole restaurant?

752
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,790
How is that possible?

753
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,450
I'm using free meal vouchers.

754
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,030
Maybe someone wants to give you two a surprise.

755
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,280
The whole restaurant has been booked for the two-hour lunchtime today.

756
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,680
We'll only serve you two.

757
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,610
Thank you.

758
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,960
Please enjoy your meal.

759
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,470
She must be mistaken.

760
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,410
Should we leave first?

761
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,880
Otherwise, if they ask us to pay the fee for booking the whole restaurant,

762
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,810
we'll be doomed.

763
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,180
I booked the whole restaurant.

764
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,830
Let's eat.

765
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,760
You booked the whole restaurant?

766
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,760
So,

767
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,020
this is the taste of concern.

768
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,969
All right.

769
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,170
Sorry to keep you waiting.

770
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,190
It's okay.

771
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,139
I was the one who asked you out.

772
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,070
What's more,

773
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,270
while I was waiting for you, your grandma's concern kept my company.

774
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,810
What do you want to tell me?

775
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,380
Let's go to that place first.

776
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,909
Then I'll tell you about it.

777
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:38,830
Okay.

778
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,650
Let's go.

779
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,699
Did you drink it up?

780
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,250
Yes, of course.

781
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,850
It was very delicious, wasn't it?

782
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,350
Yes. It had the flavor of your grandma.

783
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,750
The flavor of my grandma?

784
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,670
Did I really not do anything yesterday?

785
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,990
I won't tell you.

786
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,160
You don't remember it anyway.

787
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,750
Just tell me.

788
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,740
Did I do anything embarrassing?

789
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,150
It's hard to say.

790
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,130
Why did you bring me here?

791
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,780
Previously, at Keke's home,

792
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,510
I said that I had bought some investment-type insurance policies.

793
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:27,990
Here

794
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,330
is the money I've saved these years.

795
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,530
One million NT dollars?

796
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,120
You've saved so much money.

797
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,900
All I know to do

798
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,990
is playing video games and studying.

799
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,220
Studying?

800
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,530
I've got many scholarships since I was a kid.

801
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,650
Later, my mom asked me to make some investments.

802
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,590
I've earned

803
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
so much money without realizing it.

804
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
I didn't know that

805
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,970
you were so good at studying.

806
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,280
But...

807
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,630
I want to tell you something honestly.

808
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,070
After I had the spiritual Yoga class,

809
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,780
I still can't find my dream.

810
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,700
It's okay.

811
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,480
I told you that

812
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,280
you don't have to have a dream.

813
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,920
I know.

814
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,590
But the money has been saved here all the time,

815
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,210
and it has no value like that.

816
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,710
I'm thinking that

817
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,410
I should use it to make an investment

818
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,010
so that I can earn more money.

819
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,380
Making an investment

820
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,960
sounds like a good idea.

821
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,040
What are you going to do?

822
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,440
I'm going to

823
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,680
invest in you.

824
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,710
You're going to invest in me?

825
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,450
At the bazaar this time,

826
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,310
your cup cakes were very popular.

827
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,440
I think highly of your potential,

828
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,280
so I've decided to cancel all the insurance policies.

829
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,810
I'll use the money to invest in your shop

830
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,210
and be your shareholder.

831
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,110
Do you trust me that much?

832
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,490
Of course.

833
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,070
Although I love playing video games,

834
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,740
I still have good judgement for investment.

835
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,110
You're definitely a blue chip stock.

836
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,110
Jiali.

837
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,180
No matter why

838
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,240
you've got a dream,

839
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,430
this is something very happy.

840
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,590
Let me open the shop

841
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,880
with you.

842
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,750
When you realize your dream,

843
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,380
I can also earn more money.

844
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,130
This is a win-win situation.

845
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,710
You're really good at scheduling.

846
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,170
I had a great date today.

847
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,920
Are you serious?

848
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,580
Yes.

849
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,040
But I got tired very soon.

850
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
We didn't enjoy the date after that.

851
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,350
It's my fault.

852
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,630
You were busy all day long at the bazaar yesterday.

853
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,290
It's normal to be tired today.

854
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,470
I should have sent you back home early to rest.

855
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,500
Well,

856
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,840
our date is finished like this today.

857
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,010
Do you feel very disappointed?

858
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,170
Not at all.

859
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,510
As long as I'm with you,

860
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,410
no matter where we go or what we do,

861
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,970
I'll be happy.

862
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,390
Really?

863
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,290
Yes.

864
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,610
Don't take it to heart.

865
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,630
There's still plenty of time for us in the future.

866
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,910
We still have many dates waiting for us.

867
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,550
Okay.

868
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,150
Just go back and rest.

869
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,560
No.

870
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
Why did you say no?

871
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,880
We haven't finished the final ritual

872
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,930
for a date yet.

873
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,930
The final ritual for a date?

874
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,860
Bye bye.

875
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,700
Jian Keke.

876
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,130
What?

877
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,240
Bye bye.

878
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,890
I really don't want to leave.

879
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,060
Hurry up.

880
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,180
Otherwise, if my dad sees you later,

881
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,980
he'll ask many questions again.

882
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,310
Or

883
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,650
has he already seen me?

884
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,360
Really?

885
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,410
Probably.

886
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
-I think he saw me.
-Just go.

887
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,540
It's all right since he has seen me.

888
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,960
Just go back and rest.

889
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,870
I'm leaving.

890
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,630
Be careful.

891
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,880
Keke.

892
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,410
Come with me.

893
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,830
Why should I go with you?

894
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,620
Someone wants to see you.

895
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,410
Who is it? Who wants to see me?

896
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,250
Haikuo's father.

897
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,520
You must have been scammed.

898
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,680
What do you mean by being scammed?

899
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,040
Well, Haikuo told me that

900
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,350
his father had

901
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,900
passed away.

902
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,050
What is this place?

903
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,210
If I had a house like this,

904
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,080
I could also spend 52,000 NT dollars a night without hesitation.

905
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,080
Hello, President.

906
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,510
I just asked you to bring someone here.

907
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,380
Why were you so slow?

908
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,510
I'm sorry, President Wang.

909
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,890
Because there was a misunderstanding which I needed to explain.

910
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,310
That's why I'm late.

911
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,430
How come he looks a bit familiar?

912
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,320
I want to go to Lane No. 16, Alley No. 47.

913
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,720
But I couldn't find it after going around here for a long time.

914
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,340
You're the one who asked for directions that day.

915
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,340
It looks like you have a good memory.

916
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,640
Chen Shi, this is definitely a scam.

917
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,830
Why are you pretending to be Haikuo's father?

918
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,460
I'm sorry, President Wang.

919
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,430
She just has a slight doubt.

920
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,360
What doubt?

921
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,200
Haikuo said his father had passed away.

922
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,660
It's impossible that he's Haikuo's father.

923
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:11,910
It's a misunderstanding.

924
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,710
President Wang,

925
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,120
please show mercy

926
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,220
and forgive us.

927
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,310
What are you doing?

928
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,510
Why are you so humble?

929
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,850
As a salesman,

930
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,180
I need to be flexible.

931
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,380
I'm not being humble.

932
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,770
What does this have to do with your sales business?

933
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,410
The person who introduced me to President Wang

934
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,980
was my big client, Mr. Fang.

935
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,300
For that bottle of wine which I gave to Mr. Zhang,

936
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,700
it was also Mr. Fang who helped me obtain it.

937
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,240
So how big is your client?

938
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,310
Very big.

939
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,240
He contributed to

940
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,100
at least halft of my performance.

941
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,030
Even Mr. Fang has to listen to President Wang.

942
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,300
If I get along well with him,

943
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,550
he'll be the top client of our company.

944
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,140
We can't slight him.

945
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,300
So you mean that

946
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,870
President Wang is Haikuo's father?

947
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,880
He's Haikuo's father?

948
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,160
Yes.

949
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,970
Why does he want to see me?

950
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,410
Whatever he wants you to do,

951
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,470
just say yes first.

952
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,130
This concerns our company's future.

953
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,880
Okay?

954
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,530
What are you whispering about?

955
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,730
How rude!

956
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:23,870
President.

957
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,510
I'm sorry.

958
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,420
Just now, I...

959
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,710
I was... I was too rude.

960
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,810
Since you've asked me to come,

961
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,250
what can I do for you?

962
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,850
I'll do my best to fulfill your request.

963
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,240
Are you sure you can fulfill

964
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,010
all my request for you?

965
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,510
Just say yes.

966
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,180
Yes.

967
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,490
Then I want you to leave my son.

968
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,640
[Preview]

969
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,520
He wants to invest in you?

970
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,630
Just reject him.

971
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,430
Whether it's family love, romantic love or friendship,

972
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,030
once money is involved in it,

973
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,560
it'll be very complicated.

974
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,590
Elly.

975
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,970
You are so beautiful.

976
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,270
Then let me ask you.

977
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:06,970
Do you

978
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,700
like girls

979
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,760
who are like me?

980
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,070
Are you really going to help him and his father to make up with each other?

981
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,240
At most, he'll just be surprised to see his father.

982
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,560
I don't think it'll be too embarrassing.

983
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,160
I told you he's not my father.

984
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:18,860
Jian Keke.

985
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,630
I don't need you to interfere in my family affairs.
