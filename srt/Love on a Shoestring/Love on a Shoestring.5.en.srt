00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,980
Yes! Good job!

[Episode 5]

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,230
Okay. Again.

6
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,880
Jiali, I'm about to finish this round.

7
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,620
Wait for me.

8
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,240
Let's go have midnight snacks after I'm done.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,980
Okay.

10
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,050
Anyway,

11
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,740
I'm looking for a suitable storefront.

12
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,090
Okay.

13
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,680
Come on. Again.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,780
It's the same.

15
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,090
Awesome!

16
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,440
Okay, I'm going to play one more round.

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,240
What gear did you bring?

18
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,060
Go.

19
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,890
You go that way.

20
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,430
Okay, I'll go this way.

21
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,410
Be careful.

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,610
Why did you bring a broadsword? To till the land?

23
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,070
Someone's here. Hurry.

24
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,430
Jiali is tired.

25
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,020
Why is she still accompanying her boyfriend playing games?

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,500
It would be great that we don't see our enemies.

27
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,960
Zhigang.

28
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,650
How about this one?

29
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,980
What do you think?

30
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,500
The rent is 78,000 NT dollars per month.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,730
It's too expensive.

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,890
See if there's a cheaper one.

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,380
I think you're right.

34
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,550
We just started a business. It indeed is too expensive.

35
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,780
Yeah.

36
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,170
Jiali, listen.

37
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,060
I'm the most experienced in finding a storefront.

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,690
When I'm not busy,

39
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,990
I'll look for one with you some other day.

40
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,700
Okay?

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,500
Okay.

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,620
Well...

43
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,730
Right, my friend said

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,490
he wants to play another round.

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,060
Can you...

46
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,390
You're going to play another round?

47
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,850
I think I should go back first.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm tired.

49
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,260
But we haven't had midnight snacks yet.

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,490
How about this? I'm going to tell him

51
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,200
I don't want to play anymore.

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,530
Let's go now.

53
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,079
Alright.

54
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,710
You guys play one more round. I'll wait for you.

55
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,450
I knew it. You're the kindest to me.

56
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,780
It's so good to have you.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,730
Wait for me. It won't take long.

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,220
Hurry up. I still have things to do.

59
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,610
None of your business. Hurry up.

60
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,250
Okay, go.

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,520
Good job.

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,250
Why are you here?

63
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,420
Did Michael Zhao come with you?

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,390
No.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,579
I didn't see him.

66
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,420
Get on the motorbike.

67
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,350
I'll give you a ride to the company.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,860
Why do you want to give me a ride to the company?

69
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,320
I can just take a bus.

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,210
We just became boyfriend and girlfriend. We're still passionately in love.

71
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,070
If Michael Zhao finds out

72
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,160
I didn't give you a ride to the company,

73
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,170
he would think he still has a chance.

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,480
So he won't give up.

75
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,700
I think you have a point.

76
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,079
Then...

77
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,050
thank you.

78
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,580
I think you're so considerate.

79
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,460
There must be a lot of people liking you, right?

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,660
Do you mind?

81
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,530
No.

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,690
Why would I mind?

83
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,420
Let's go, Boyfriend.

84
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,520
Excuse me. I want to ask

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,360
what I should grab.

86
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,230
I don't think you have handles on your motorbike.

87
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,700
It's our company's new product:

88
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,620
morning tea.

89
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,730
Try it.

90
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,720
Drinking it can calm you down.

91
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,850
You are angry early in the morning.

92
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,220
Look at you.

93
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,750
Be careful of skin aging.

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,180
Come on.

95
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,950
It's hot.

96
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,480
Nothing goes smoothly.

97
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,340
It must be because of Jian Keke.

98
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,500
Last night,

99
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,490
when I thought of the fact

100
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,159
that Jian Keke has been with Wang Haikuo,

101
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,020
I couldn't sleep for ten minutes.

102
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,350
Ten minutes!

103
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,920
Now I have dark circles.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Before Keke said yes yesterday,

105
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,150
she peeked at me on purpose.

106
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,750
She must hate me for giving her the wedding invitation card last time,

107
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,150
so she took the chance to take revenge on me.

108
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,910
They are pretending?

109
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,170
I don't think so.

110
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,460
According to a man's instinct,

111
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,470
I think

112
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,150
Wang Haikuo is serious.

113
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,860
Jian Keke is a human.

114
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,060
She has emotions.

115
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,680
She's not a trophy

116
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,350
used to satisfy your pride.

117
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,380
I will make her my girlfriend successfully.

118
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,580
You think Haikuo is serious?

119
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,490
I think he is

120
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,760
very serious.

121
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,880
But I still think it's incredible.

122
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,020
They only knew each other not long ago.

123
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,940
Did he tell you how he knew Jian Keke?

124
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,250
He didn't say he knew her.

125
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,630
Right,

126
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,620
that day, he suddenly asked me

127
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,260
which floor the Accounting Department is on.

128
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,300
Looks like it's true

129
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,510
that Haikuo joined our company for Keke.

130
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,100
But

131
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,390
how come Keke didn't recognize Haikuo?

132
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,050
They are here.

133
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,930
Wait.

134
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,280
This is for you.

135
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,289
Thank you for giving me a ride to the company.

136
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
What do you remember?

137
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,840
I remember.

138
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,020
You bought this milk for me last time, right?

139
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,950
I can't be angry.

140
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,350
I can't be angry.

141
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,020
Anger will make you old.

142
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,980
Anger will make you old.

143
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,600
I can't be angry.

144
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,960
But I'm really angry.

145
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,310
Have some.

146
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,120
Have some tea.

147
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,000
What boyfriend?

148
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,060
Aren't you ashamed?

149
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,900
Shameless!

150
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,840
-He's my boyfriend, okay?
-Miss.

151
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,430
I... I really need you.

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,020
Maybe your...

153
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,900
your family and friends sometimes need you,

154
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,780
but I'm not like them, Jiali.

155
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,440
I really need you.

156
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,220
Jiali.

157
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,020
You haven't applied the egg mixture yet.

158
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,220
You're right. I forgot.

159
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,910
Jiali,

160
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,440
someone wants to see you.

161
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,010
Is it the girl from last time?

162
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,750
No, it's a man.

163
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,390
I asked him to wait outside.

164
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,370
Okay. Thank you, Manager.

165
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,230
Why are you here?

166
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,890
When will you get off work today?

167
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,850
I'll get off work at 6 p.m. Why?

168
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,260
I have something to tell you.

169
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,490
Can we have dinner together after work?

170
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,760
Can't you tell me now?

171
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,800
It's not convenient.

172
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,820
Okay.

173
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,770
Let's meet after work.

174
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,420
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,010
Be careful.

177
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,290
What's wrong with you?

178
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,360
Everyone,

179
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,190
there's a new Internet-famous restaurant

180
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,370
near our company.

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,710
Does anyone want to go with me?

182
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,300
Me.

183
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,010
Okay.

184
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,360
Jian Keke.

185
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,620
Why are there three receipts missing for Division One's reimbursement?

186
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,350
Did you go easy on Division One?

187
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,930
Katy,

188
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,050
please help me find a piece of A4 paper

189
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,300
on Elly's desk.

190
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,460
There are three receipts of catering expenses on it.

191
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,280
The total amount is 1,040 NT dollars.

192
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,520
I looked for it, but I just couldn't find it.

193
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,720
Even if you ask Katy to look for it ten times, the result will remain the same.

194
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,600
Elly,

195
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,460
I found it.

196
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,490
It was behind the computer screen.

197
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,940
Next time before you question others,

198
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,060
make sure you have a clear understanding of your own situation

199
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,250
to avoid unnecessary embarrassment.

200
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,150
If you had stapled it well when you gave it to me,

201
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,840
why was it dropped there?

202
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,830
You must have made a mistake

203
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,050
when you did your job.

204
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,490
Please

205
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,410
recheck all the files

206
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,160
you just gave me.

207
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,300
I've finished my work.

208
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,820
I have no obligation to check them for you.

209
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,040
[Information Room]

210
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,140
Sorry.

211
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,020
Excuse me.

212
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,470
Are you... in a meeting?

213
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,550
Why are you here?

214
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,290
I'm here to ask you to have lunch together.

215
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,090
Check them yourself.

216
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,900
Let's go.

217
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,120
Elly,

218
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,350
I'll recheck

219
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,670
all the receipts with you.

220
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,740
It's not my fault.

221
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,220
Why should I recheck them?

222
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,800
I'm so angry.

223
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,460
You're new here.

224
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,730
There's something you may not know.

225
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,550
They have been like this

226
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,060
for a long time.

227
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,250
Listen to my advice.

228
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,270
Workplace rule number one:

229
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,670
if you want to live,

230
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,620
stay away from the battlefield.

231
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,090
You'll get used to it.

232
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,710
Let's go eat on our own.

233
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,590
Okay.

234
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,020
Let's go.

235
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,750
It's an Internet-famous restaurant.

236
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,770
I don't know what you like to eat,

237
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,880
so I brought a portion of each dish.

238
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,330
This is too much.

239
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,290
How can we finish them all?

240
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,820
It's okay even if you can't finish them.

241
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,950
You can pack them up and take them home.

242
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,510
Wang Haikuo

243
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,040
is really generous.

244
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,750
Luckily, we're not actually in a relationship.

245
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,820
Otherwise, considering his habit of spending money,

246
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,350
I definitely will go crazy.

247
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,010
Jiali,

248
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,360
when do you usually

249
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,600
have lunch with Keke?

250
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,090
We don't have lunch on specific days.

251
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,820
But we eat together about two or three days a week.

252
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,140
If I

253
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,520
eat with you,

254
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,250
will I interrupt your heart-to-heart talks?

255
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,060
No.

256
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,660
But do you mean

257
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,610
you want to eat with us often?

258
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,380
Yes.

259
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,810
Well,

260
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,990
Jiali is one of us.

261
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,250
You don't need to pretend in front of her.

262
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,780
Pretend? What do you mean?

263
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,020
I mean

264
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,120
when it's lunchtime in the future,

265
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,860
we can leave the company together

266
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,260
and then eat separately.

267
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,930
Then we can set up a time to meet and go back to the company together.

268
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,660
That should do it.

269
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,320
We don't need to eat together.

270
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,310
Why should we eat separately?

271
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,090
We're not actually a couple.

272
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,890
Why should we eat together?

273
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,620
Also, we can have time to take a break like this.

274
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,800
Isn't that great?

275
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,830
Couple?

276
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,750
Are you two in a relationship?

277
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,790
No.

278
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,270
He's pretending with me

279
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,550
to make Michael Zhao give up

280
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,270
and make Elly angry by the way.

281
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,990
I'm not pretending.

282
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
If you are not pretending,

283
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,670
were you serious

284
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,089
when you confessed your love to me that day?

285
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,450
I was serious

286
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,890
when I confessed my love to you that day.

287
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,910
I need...

288
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,290
to... to calm down.

289
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,990
Keke.

290
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,780
Jiali, sorry.

291
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,720
I think I need you to accompany Keke.

292
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,230
I think she will be embarrassed if she sees me now.

293
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,220
Okay. I'm going to accompany her first.

294
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,620
Thank you for your lunch.

295
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,150
Bye.

296
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,510
This is for you.

297
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,930
The second one is 40% off.

298
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,550
Impulsive consumption really calms me down.

299
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,130
Are you okay?

300
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,000
No.

301
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,490
What should you do now?

302
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,440
I don't know.

303
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,730
Haikuo likes you.

304
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,910
Haven't you felt anything before?

305
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,550
Come on, we knew each other not long ago.

306
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,020
We just meet every day at work.

307
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,560
We only met twice privately.

308
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,030
The first time is when we had a car accident.

309
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,490
The second time is when...

310
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,510
we met with Mr. Zhang.

311
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,410
So you remember clearly?

312
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
Everything?

313
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,890
Yes.

314
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,640
I mean...

315
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,650
the first time we met.

316
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,690
What?

317
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,650
Could it be that he knew me a long time ago?

318
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,380
Really?

319
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,120
When?

320
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
How would I know?

321
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,450
I don't remember I have seen this person before.

322
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,950
In my opinion,

323
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,590
since you can't remember,

324
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,270
you should take the initiative to talk to him.

325
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,770
I should take the initiative?

326
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,010
After all, you agreed to date him.

327
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,420
You should at least clear up this misunderstanding.

328
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,460
Give him an explanation before you break up.

329
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,620
Otherwise, it would look like

330
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,550
you're playing with his feelings.

331
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,390
I'm playing with his feelings?

332
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,580
[Trendee
Business Department]

333
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,870
The project I just reported

334
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,900
is a manufacturer

335
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,980
Division One will talk to this month.

336
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,930
The content of Chen Shi's report

337
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,800
will also be sent to Division Two and Division Three's managers.

338
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,000
Please recheck

339
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,500
if there are the same competitors

340
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,100
to ensure everyone's efforts won't be in vain.

341
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,890
Okay.

342
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,220
Before getting off work,

343
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,150
Division Three will send it to you.

344
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,270
That's all

345
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,490
for today's meeting.

346
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,620
By the way,

347
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,270
Mr. Wang,

348
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,250
you just got a girlfriend, right?

349
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,220
Why do you look so serious?

350
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,070
I heard

351
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,740
when people are in a relationship,

352
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,240
even the air smells sweet.

353
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,840
Mr. Zhao,

354
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,390
we don't talk about personal matters during working hours.

355
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,650
I don't need to remind you of this, right?

356
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,120
The meeting is almost over, right?

357
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
There is nothing wrong

358
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,150
with communicating with each other

359
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,680
when we're free during working hours, right?

360
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,590
Or doesn't Mr. Wang

361
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,190
want to communicate with us?

362
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,950
Okay, it doesn't matter.

363
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,050
That's all for today's meeting.

364
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,210
Dismiss.

365
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,690
See you.

366
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,610
Bye.

367
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,120
Mr. Wang,

368
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,970
you're already in a relationship with Keke, right?

369
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,240
Why do you look unhappy?

370
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,120
We're not in a relationship.

371
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,030
But Keke said yes in front of everyone, right?

372
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,050
She thought I was pretending.

373
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,770
Pretending?

374
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,320
Since she's not taking it seriously,

375
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,410
that's great.

376
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,000
I think God

377
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,040
is giving you a chance to turn back.

378
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,760
What do you mean?

379
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,130
God must have sympathy for you,

380
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,440
a kind person.

381
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,170
Just let go.

382
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,240
I know

383
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,200
you must be sad about your breakup.

384
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,860
But promise me,

385
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,770
don't be sad for too long.

386
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,080
Okay?

387
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm here.

388
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,660
Do I look like I'm sad?

389
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,430
During the meeting just now,

390
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,690
you pulled a really long face.

391
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,870
Really?

392
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,160
Indeed.

393
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,680
That's because your report is really bad.

394
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,810
Maybe it's my problem.

395
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,060
I will improve the report.

396
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,310
But what happened to Keke

397
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,540
was just as expected.

398
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,420
What do you mean by "as expected"?

399
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,380
It was just as expected?

400
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,420
Keke wants to see me.

401
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,780
I'll come back to discuss it with you later.

402
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,400
Okay.

403
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,220
Put it on my desk.

404
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,790
Mr. Zhao, you're really scrupulous in separating your work from your private life.

405
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,920
You're even so professional while experiencing disappointment in love.

406
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,120
Acting?

407
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,860
I knew it.

408
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,380
Jian Keke loves money so much.

409
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,510
How would she fall in love with a human?

410
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,040
Now she must be very bothered about Haikuo's love for her.

411
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,770
So we need to find a way

412
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,850
to make Keke more eager to stay away from Haikuo.

413
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,850
At the same time, we have to make Haikuo give up on Keke.

414
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
What should we do?

415
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,560
The most typical case

416
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,590
is that the hero saves the beauty.

417
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,290
What do you want to do?

418
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,400
Haikuo, save me!

419
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,980
Do you think that

420
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,540
I'll be afraid of three people?

421
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,300
Go!

422
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,470
Come here.

423
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,350
-Let go of me!
-What are you doing?

424
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,160
Let go of that girl!

425
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,070
Michael Zhao!

426
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,810
I don't need a real man.

427
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,410
As long as you have money, it'll be fine.

428
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,310
Yes, I have a lot of money.

429
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,280
I have money.

430
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,630
It's a good tactic,

431
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
but the plot is a bit old-fashioned.

432
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,450
It seems to be an inferior tactic that was

433
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,310
once used in a certain idol drama.

434
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,980
Although the plot is old-fashioned,

435
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,830
it's always effective.

436
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,270
You...

437
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,590
Do you want to chase Keke or not?

438
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,590
Yes.

439
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,290
Very good.

440
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,640
Then let's do it today, rather than do it another day.

441
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,580
Tonight,

442
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,710
let's catch them off guard.

443
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,590
Okay.

444
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,650
Happy cooperation.

445
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,990
Happy cooperation.

446
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,160
You're going to tell me something, aren't you?

447
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,440
How come we're meeting each other at the karaoke bar?

448
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,490
I think

449
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,740
it's safer here.

450
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,430
It's safer?

451
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,660
What do you mean?

452
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,920
I...

453
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,870
Drink slowly.

454
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,300
For what I want to tell you,

455
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,680
I need to have a drink first before saying it.

456
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,630
But I don't like drinking alcohol.

457
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,300
I can't have a drink with you.

458
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,800
It's okay.

459
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I'll get drunk after drinking almost one bottle of it.

460
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,440
But...

461
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,230
you look fine.

462
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,320
Of course.

463
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,190
I only drank one bottle of it.

464
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,340
Then why did you say that you would get drunk after drinking one bottle of it?

465
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
How could you believe in such words?

466
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,900
Beer contains only 5% alcohol,

467
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,090
instead of 50%.

468
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,130
Jiali,

469
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,460
I really think that

470
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,860
you need to change your naive personality.

471
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,040
Your boyfriend looks suspicious.

472
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,890
Even an outsider like me can perceive that

473
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,690
he's hiding something from you.

474
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,860
You must be wondering

475
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,040
why I know that.

476
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,120
When you were waiting for your boyfriend that day,

477
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,100
I was there, too.

478
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,370
You waited for 56 minutes and 8 seconds.

479
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,380
It was 3,368 seconds in total.

480
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,280
I can't believe that you waited for him for so long.

481
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,720
If he really liked you,

482
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,360
he wouldn't have let you wait for even a second.

483
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,800
So you were also there that day?

484
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,430
Of course.

485
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,490
It was in the middle of the night.

486
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,490
It was dangerous for a girl like you.

487
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,860
According to the police administration data,

488
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,560
in the past eight years,

489
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,500
the population of juveniles has sharply decreased by 810,000,

490
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,100
but the number of juvenile suspects has increased by 16%.

491
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,990
He left you in danger and didn't care about you.

492
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,920
How despicable.

493
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,250
A warm person like you

494
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,310
should find someone who can really treat you nicely.

495
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,810
You should know that

496
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,050
true happiness is waiting for you.

497
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,970
So I hope that

498
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,050
you can think it through and figure it out.

499
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,070
Don't let that scumbag

500
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,750
ruin your happiness anymore.

501
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,370
Do you know

502
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,670
where your happiness is?

503
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,900
I don't know.

504
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,950
Your happiness...

505
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,360
Yuanchong.

506
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,330
Yuanchong.

507
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,700
Yuanchong.

508
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:57,830
Thank you.

509
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,740
It smells familiar.

510
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,130
This is the coffee I brought from the pantry of our company.

511
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,490
In this way, we don't have to go to a cafe.

512
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,090
It's noisy and costly there.

513
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,110
The view here is so nice.

514
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,790
And we can have a good chat.

515
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,300
Right. There are few people here, too.

516
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,180
Then you can talk about it carefully.

517
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,660
I thought you asked me out

518
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,350
in order to tell me something.

519
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,740
I asked you out

520
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,690
in order to give you a chance to explain it carefully.

521
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,990
Did we know each other before?

522
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,520
When did we meet each other?

523
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,790
There's only one truth.

524
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,650
Don't lie to me.

525
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,870
I really like you.

526
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,680
What I want to hear is the truth, not your confession of love.

527
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,570
Since the first time I met you,

528
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,320
I've never forgotten you.

529
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,020
So you fell in love with me at first sight?

530
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,440
When I was a sophomore in high school,

531
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,300
my mom was diagnosed with cancer.

532
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,780
There were only three months left for her to live.

533
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
But because of what had happened in my family,

534
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,580
my dad didn't care about my mom's condition at all.

535
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,270
In the end,

536
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,580
I was the only one who accompanied my mom.

537
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,659
Actually, it didn't take three months.

538
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,480
When my mom passed away,

539
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,050
my dad had never come to visit her.

540
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,420
I was the only one

541
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,010
who felt sad for my mom

542
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,690
and cried for my mom.

543
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,110
Answer the phone.

544
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Why aren't you answering the phone?

545
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,220
Answer the phone.

546
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,380
Why aren't you answering the phone?

547
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,330
[Father]

548
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,830
You've shed too many tears.

549
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,620
Drinking milk can help to replenish your strength

550
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,080
and the water you've lost.

551
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,780
Just keep crying.

552
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,150
It's okay.

553
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,930
I'm serious.

554
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,760
If you're sad about something,

555
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,620
just vent it out. Don't hold it in.

556
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,930
If you feel embarrassed about crying

557
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,600
because I'm here,

558
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,970
I'll leave now.

559
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,810
It's okay.

560
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,380
Can you accompany me?

561
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,460
So that's why you bought

562
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,720
the milk of that brand for me at that time?

563
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,930
I see.

564
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,300
Actually,

565
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,690
at that time,

566
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,930
I didn't need any comfort.

567
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,700
I just hoped that

568
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,780
someone could stay by my side

569
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,240
so that I wouldn't feel so lonely.

570
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,910
Though you were a stranger,

571
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,300
you gave me this warmth.

572
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,430
It was really warm.

573
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,170
When I gave you the milk,

574
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,890
did I have two bottles of milk in my hands

575
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,490
and then give you one of them?

576
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,260
Yes.

577
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,330
From what I know about myself,

578
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,820
I bought one bottle of the milk and got one free.

579
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,880
Because I would never spend money

580
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,990
buying milk for others.

581
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,790
So just don't take it seriously.

582
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,260
Whether you bought one and got one free or not,

583
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,140
you gave me your milk after all,

584
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,980
and accompanied me.

585
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,770
You made me know that

586
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,060
there was still such a kind of gentleness in this world.

587
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,020
So you fell in love with me because of this?

588
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,340
At that time, you were there

589
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,360
because your dad was sent to the emergency room for an upset stomach.

590
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,000
Later, I was busy with my mom's funeral,

591
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,260
so I didn't have time to get to know you.

592
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,310
Only until now can I do that.

593
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,680
Now?

594
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,290
Now I know that

595
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,220
you work in the Accounting Department of this company,

596
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,550
I took the initiative to join the company.

597
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,350
So that's the reason?

598
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,290
It's because of me?

599
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,670
I admire your deep affection and perseverance very much.

600
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,280
But

601
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,490
it's all too sudden.

602
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,960
And I really don't remember

603
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,020
the incident which you said just now.

604
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,750
It's okay.

605
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,960
It's not okay.

606
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,690
Because your feelings for me have been accumulated day by day.

607
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,790
But I just regard you

608
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,590
as a new colleague I've just met.

609
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,100
Then we...

610
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,290
So we can get to know each other again.

611
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,340
Because as you know me now,

612
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,990
you look at me with a beauty filter. You've beautified me.

613
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,530
Well,

614
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,170
actually, I'm not that good.

615
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,110
So you mean...

616
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,770
So I mean

617
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,890
we must break up with each other,

618
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,240
and we should do it thoroughly and resolutely.

619
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,570
It's good for both of us.

620
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,630
Okay.

621
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,110
Yes. Then...

622
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,350
Okay?

623
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,410
I agree.

624
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,770
Let's break up.

625
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,560
Well...

626
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,340
You agree? You made up your mind so fast?

627
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,820
As long as you say it,

628
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,480
I'm willing to accept it.

629
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,720
Okay.

630
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,480
Well...

631
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,000
Do you want me to take you home?

632
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,930
It's okay. No need.

633
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,900
Just give me your family's number.

634
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,270
I'll ask your family to come pick you up.

635
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,350
Remember.

636
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,840
No matter what happens,

637
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,700
you still have me.

638
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,090
I'll remember that.

639
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,330
Bye.

640
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,770
Just let me take you home.

641
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,050
I can go home by myself.

642
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,490
Why are you here?

643
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,590
What are you doing?

644
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,390
So what if she saw us?

645
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,120
Don't be sad.

646
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,810
This scumbag is not worth it.

647
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,530
You called me a scumbag?

648
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,010
Who do you think you are?

649
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,340
Jiali, what's going on now?

650
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,220
Are you dating this guy

651
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,640
behind my back?

652
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,910
We just came out for a chat after work.

653
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,420
You two are so close.

654
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,720
You even asked to meet each other after work.

655
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,910
And you had this appointment at the karaoke bar.

656
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,400
Zhigang, let’s go to

657
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,350
a motel and have a chat there later.

658
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,370
Jiali, you've gone too far.

659
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,190
You said you would forgive me.

660
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,330
I even accompanied you while you were working every day,

661
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,520
and then picked you up from work.

662
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,730
But it turns out that you're dating this guy now.

663
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,510
He's just a colleague.

664
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,090
So it's a romantic relationship at the workplace.

665
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,920
That's so sweet.

666
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,800
Jiali, you're breaking my heart by doing this.

667
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,720
I even trusted you so much.

668
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,450
I kept fawning on you. You...

669
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,520
You blamed me for having an ambiguous relationship with Weishan.

670
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,060
In the end,

671
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,480
you're not faithful to me, either.

672
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,010
-You also don't know that you should avoid suspicion.
-Don't say such mean words!

673
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,140
Why did you hit him?

674
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,610
You're being ridiculous.

675
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,980
Are you all right?

676
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,230
Don't worry.

677
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,550
When people are in danger,

678
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,090
they tend to have a fragile state of mind.

679
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,950
This tactic will definitely be useful to Jian Keke.

680
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,400
But Keke is a very strong woman.

681
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,520
Do you understand the theory of "Misattribution of Arousal"?

682
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,290
Because of fear,

683
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,090
one might misunderstand that it's romantic love.

684
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,870
But I'm afraid of heights.

685
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,230
Since when have you been afraid of heights?

686
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,100
Now.

687
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,650
Michael Zhao.

688
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,440
We're already here.

689
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,620
We've even hired some part-time actors.

690
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,470
You want to give up now?

691
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,770
This is not okay.

692
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,940
Look. My skin is so tender.

693
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,350
What if I get hurt

694
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,210
when I really fight with them?

695
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,200
Don't worry. Okay?

696
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,420
The people I hired are professional martial artists.

697
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,490
They're very good at faking a fight.

698
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,620
Later, just swing your hand like this,

699
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,220
and kick them with your foot like this.

700
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,630
They can be quite cooperative.

701
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,630
Okay?

702
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,310
Are you having a date at night?

703
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,060
They're coming.

704
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,540
[Preview]

705
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,000
I said, "Let go of that girl!"

706
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,890
Just test whether the relationship between you two

707
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,270
is solid enough.

708
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,550
I've broken up with Jian Keke.

709
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,520
There's no need to test it.

710
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,780
You're in a bad mood.

711
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,280
Is it because of Haikuo?

712
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,000
I

713
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:35,420
am

714
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:35,810
not

715
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,220
pregnant

716
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,870
at all!

717
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,200
There's blood.

718
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,030
Thank you for helping me change into these clothes.

719
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,320
I wasn't the one who helped you get changed.

720
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,560
I really hope that

721
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,390
you and Yuanchong can develop an ambiguous relationship.

722
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,550
So you should smile more.

723
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,440
I believe that there will be many people who like you.

724
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,090
Then what about you?
