[Episode 15]

4
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,450
What is this?

5
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,450
Didn't you say

6
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,320
you don't want flowers

7
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,500
because they are not practical?

8
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,560
You want to have a lot of money, right?

9
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,780
I specially

10
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,620
asked the boss to design this plant

11
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,810
that gives a feeling of having a lot of money.

12
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,160
What do you think? It's beautiful, right?

13
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,530
I think you misunderstood me.

14
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,850
By having a lot of money,

15
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,380
I meant I hope you can save money,

16
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,360
so that we can have money to spend in the future.

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,289
I wasn't asking you to spend money.

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,640
But...

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,290
this is not very expensive.

20
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,910
How much is it?

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,800
Okay.

22
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,690
200 NT dollars. It's acceptable.

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,810
No.

24
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,010
Don't tell me

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,810
this costs more than 2,000 NT dollars.

26
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,190
Wang Haikuo, this is too expensive!

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,700
This is the cheapest set.

28
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,870
It's okay.

29
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,240
It's hot.

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,280
Where did you get burned?

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,530
My mouth, not my hand.

32
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,590
No.

33
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,860
I'm going out.

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,450
Will you come back for dinner?

35
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,820
No.

36
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,079
I'll cook with Haikuo at his place today.

37
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,840
You'll go to Haikuo's place?

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,950
Wait for me.

39
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,150
I'm going to get changed and go with you.

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,970
Why do you want to go with me?

41
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,200
Well,

42
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,980
you two will be under the same roof alone.

43
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,180
It's very dangerous.

44
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,720
I've been there before.

45
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,970
You...

46
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,010
You've been there before?

47
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,290
Why didn't I know?

48
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,950
Mom.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,270
Let me ask you.

50
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,610
I'm going to have a date with my boyfriend.

51
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,610
Isn't it strange

52
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,640
that your husband wants to go with me?

53
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,210
It's not strange.

54
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,480
It's very strange.

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,900
Let me ask you.

56
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,010
Why do you want to go?

57
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,220
They're going to have a romantic time.

58
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,360
Why do you want to be a third wheel?

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,510
No, I'm worried Keke will be taken advantage of.

60
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,820
How old is she?

61
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,330
She knows how to protect herself.

62
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,940
In the past,

63
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,909
when you were pursuing me,

64
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,680
you asked me to go to your house.

65
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,610
When your parents were still home,

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,920
you asked me to go to your room

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,740
to watch some Japanese videos.

68
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,240
-And there was...
-Fine.

69
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,710
Enough.

70
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,250
Stop talking, okay?

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,200
Stop talking.

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,870
Okay.

73
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm not going.

74
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,740
But Keke,

75
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,640
I want to

76
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,610
make three rules with you.

77

[Rules for Haikuo]

78
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,540
So many rules?

79
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,890
By making three rules,

80
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,710
my father meant making three pages of rules.

81
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,650
This is just one page of them.

82
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,920
So there are two more?

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,710
He's working on them.

84
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,260
Well...

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,120
at least we can hold hands, right?

86
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,270
Let me take a look for you.

87
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,800
You can hold hands occasionally.

88
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,390
Hold hands...

89
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,050
occasionally.

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
We can hold hands.

91
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,380
Do you think

92
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,840
being in a relationship with me is annoying?

93
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,450
Why are you asking this?

94
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,660
Because my father

95
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,510
would come up with strange ideas like this

96
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,100
to restrict us.

97
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,750
No.

98
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,980
It's my honor

99

that I can make your father hostile.

100
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,810
Why does it sound like you have a tendency towards masochism?

101
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,080
If it's your family members who bully me,

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,140
I'm okay with that.

103
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,040
Really?

104
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,180
Yes.

105

Every time I go to your place,

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,750
I can feel

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,880
your family members

108
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,730
treat each other sincerely

109
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,540

I really hope that one day,

I can be a member of your family.

112
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,680
So you

113
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,240
won't hate my father?

114
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,980
I won't.

115
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,680
Your father was your lover in your previous life.

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,490
I'm your lover in this life.

117
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,010
Actually, your father is hostile to me

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,090
because he approves of me.

119
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,260
So,

120
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,680
I will do my best

121
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,010
to prove myself.

122
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,670

123

Well...

124
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,920
can we kiss?

Who is he?

129
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,870
Didn't you see

130
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,810
"the engagement party"?

131
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,500
Of course he's my fiancé.

[The engagement party]

133
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,080
Fiancé?

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,200
Really?

135
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,890
Yesterday,

136
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,179
we were engaged.

137
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,390
It's so big.

138
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,970
Wait.

139
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,130
Yesterday?

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,280
But you two are not familiar with each other.

141
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,580
Who said that?

142
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,110
Eric Sue,

143
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,140
his name is Su Mingrui.

144
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,750
He's 33 years old.

145
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,780
He is an executive in a bank

146
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,610
and earns over ten million NY dollars a year.

147
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,120
He has two houses in the central districts

148
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,110
and he bought a coupé last year.

149
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,400
He has a flexible deposit of 3.71 million NT dollars.

150
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,600
The annual dividend on shares is 1.57 million NT dollars.

151
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,980
No wonder he bought such a big diamond.

152
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,760
You're not familiar with him.

153
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
You're familiar with his money, right?

154
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,680
Right,

155
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,820
Keke,

156
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,400
Eric said

157
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,480
those who come to our wedding

158
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,410
don't need to give us red packets.

159
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,940
Because he has more money than anything else.

160
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,510
It's very risky to have a flash marriage.

161
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,970
Aren't you worried something will go wrong?

162
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,610
Don't worry.

163
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,940
I'm happy when I'm with Eric.

164
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
Because I can be myself with him.

165
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,760
Jian Keke!

166
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,680
Switch cars with me.

167
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,140
Well,

168
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,180
you enjoyed a comfortable ride in Michael Zhao's car.

169
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,210
Why do you suddenly want to switch cars?

170
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,590
I... I can't

171
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,540
sit in the same car with him now.

172
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,380
I...

173
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,280
can't get close to him.

174
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,020
I...

175
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,550
I'm...

176
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,310
about to lose myself!

Elly,

178
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,920
is Michael Zhao the reason

179
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,610
why you want a flash marriage?

180
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,740
Why did it thunder suddenly?

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,700
Jian Keke.

182
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,110
If you envy me

183
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,940
and don't want to attend my engagement party,

184
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,230
you don't need to come.

185
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,400
I won't force you.

186
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,500
Okay?

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,360
Okay.

188
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,810
I was right.

You're... getting married?

190
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,550
You're really good at keeping secrets.

191
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,950
We didn't even know you have a boyfriend.

192
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,550
Now you're getting married.

193
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,160
Because I and my fiancé,

194
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,310
Eric,

195
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,910
are very low-profile.

196
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,310
We don't like to show off.

197
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,780
Elly.

198
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,960
You're here.

199
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,940
I'm here to personally invite you guys

200
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,640
to my engagement party.

201
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,550
You're getting married?

202
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,340
Take a look at the group chat.

203
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,570
Look at the message sent by Elly.

204
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,300
Haikuo,

205
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm really sorry about last time.

206
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,610
Eric

207
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,610
suddenly proposed to me.

208
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,880
I was overwhelmed.

209
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,360
That's why I lost control.

210
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,080
It's okay.

211
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,110
This can clear up everyone's misunderstanding about me.

212
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,840
It's good.

213
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,650
I'm glad that you don't mind.

214
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,820
Honestly,

215
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,710
when you refused me last time,

216
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,310
I was not sad at all.

217
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,190
Because I realized

218
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,800
I don't like you at all.

219
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,150
I'm more suited

220
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,750
to a man like Eric.

221
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,950
Okay.

222
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,960
Well,

223
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,210
I wish you a happy marriage.

224
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,880
Thank you.

225
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,010
You must come to my wedding.

226
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,380
Not just Haikuo.

227
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,380
Everyone, come to my wedding, okay?

228
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,310
-Sure.
-Okay.

229
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,350
Remember to come.

230
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,210
Bye bye.

231
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,990
Bye bye.

232
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,330
Mr. Zhao,

233
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,530
this man looks so familiar.

234
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,940
Very good.

235
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,010
I didn't change my mind

236
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,110
or lose myself.

237
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,780
I'm me.

238
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,340
Michael Zhao is Michael Zhao.

239
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,480
I knew it.

240
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,870
Last time, I was too anxious

241
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,610
and wanted to get married so much.

242
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,340
That's why I had this illusion.

243
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,180
As long as I get married,

244
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,980
everything will be fine.

245
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,800
Cheer, everyone.

246
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,000
The woman

247
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,550
who only loves money and herself

248
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,300
is back!

249
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,880
This is strange.

250
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
The weather is nice today.

251
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,880
Why does it keep thundering?

252
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,640
It's a sign.

253
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,760
Something bad is going to happen.

254
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,210
There is nothing bad.

255
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,710
It's just the change of weather.

256
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,950
You're so superstitious.

257
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,910
It's true.

258
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,950
My grandma said

259
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,720
if it thunders when the weather is nice...

260
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,940
So scary.

261
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,050
What's so scary?

262
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,240
There's something paranormal in the ladies' room.

263
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,110
Something paranormal?

264
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,540
Really?

265
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,300
Who is here?

266
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,660
Who's crying in the ladies' room?

267
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,380
You're playing tricks in broad daylight.

268
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,990
No one is here?

269
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,930
It's strange.

270
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,460
Katy?

271
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,230
Why are you crying in the ladies' room?

272
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,630
I'm out of toilet paper.

273
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,370
Do you have any?

274
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay, don't... don't cry.

275
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,450
I broke up.

276
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,280
Sorry.

277
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,740
When did you start a romantic relationship?

278
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,260
Three months ago.

279
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,940
Three months ago?

280
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,460
Three months ago,

281
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,640
Haikuo treated everyone to a meal.

282
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,080
There was chemistry between me and Leo from Division Three.

283
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
So we wanted

284
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,650
to date each other first

285
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,750
and tell everyone

286
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,610
when our relationship is stable.

287
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,910
Leo.

288
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,340
You didn't paste the receipts well this time.

289
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,950
You even pasted some at wrong places.

290
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,480
Pay attention next time.

291
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,750
Okay, thank you.

292
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,960
The static is so strong today.

293
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,710
Is it going to rain?

294
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,560
I think it's going to rain.

295
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,610
It's nice to have a girlfriend in the Accounting Department.

296
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,540
It makes it easy to apply for funds.

297
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,650
That's right.

298
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,980
It doesn't matter even if the receipts are not pasted well.

299
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,080
I got rejected three times before.

300
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,350
Next time, please help me

301
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,610
deliver the receipts.

302
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,780
In the end,

303
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,250
he broke up with me

304
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,450
because he couldn't bear the pressure.

305
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,090
My relationship

306
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,620
is already over

307
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,320
before I could even make it public.

308
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,270
He can't withstand too much pressure.

309
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,380
He's too weak.

310
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,300
It's not okay for him to be like this.

311
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,359
It's not his fault.

312
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,349
Office romances are too scary.

313
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,470
Is that so?

314
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,400
Everyone would consider

315
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,369
how useful you can be.

316
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,810
Once they can't gain benefits,

317
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,700
you'll become a target of public criticism.

318
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,810
Is that so?

319
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,050
So...

320
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,790
So,

321
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,350
you... you can't have an office romance.

322
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,620
You think

323
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,690
you can enjoy a happy time together

324
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,150
in the company all the time.

325
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,480
It's just an illusion.

326
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,260
It won't last long.

327
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,650
An office romance is a curse.

328
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,860
Those who have office romances are destined to break up.

329
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,910
Just like me.

330
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,920
Keke.

331
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,930
Wait.

332
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,830
What's wrong?

333
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,030
Mr. Wang, what's the matter?

334
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,000
Mr. Wang?

335
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,710
Why are you being so polite?

336
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,750
We are in a public place.

337
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,450
Please keep a proper distance.

338
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,110
Don't touch me. Thank you.

339
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,040
We're colleagues.

340
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,370
Haikuo means you no harm.

341
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,120
Are you angry?

342
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,580
No, I'm not angry.

343
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,210
I'm in a very good mood.

344
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,770
Yes, I understand.

345
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,190
Sorry.

346
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,620
I didn't have lunch with you.

347
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,780
But I promise

348
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,580
as long as I'm free in the future,

349
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,780
I'll have lunch with you every day.

350
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,740
You have lunch together every day?

351
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,080
You're in a relationship?

352
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,470
Yes, we...

353
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,010
We...

354
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,050
We're not in a relationship.

355
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,880
Well...

356
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,580
we're just...

357
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,950
colleagues.

358
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,020
Actually, we don't need to have lunch together every day,

359
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,580
so that we can rest well

360
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,310
during the lunch break.

361
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
Well...

362
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,190
keep a proper distance.

363
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,280
Don't touch me.

364
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,040
Bye bye.

365
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,820
Mr. Wang,

366
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,190
what on earth did you do to Keke?

367
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,910
Did you borrow money from her

368
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,040
or

369
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,340
did you make her lose the chance to buy discounted goods?

370
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,590
Neither.

371
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,680
No.

372
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,080
You must have done something.

373
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,880
She gave you milk last time.

374
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,220
She even invited you to her house for dinner.

375
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,340
If you didn't offend her,

376
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,400
why is she treating you like this now?

377
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,270
Women really are unpredictable.

378
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,680
Sometimes, she treats you well.

379
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,740
Sometimes, she treats you poorly.

380
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,440
This is something popular jointly introduced by a famous restaurant

381
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,980
and a convenience store.

382
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,230
It's very delicious.

383
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,450
You don't want to eat?

384
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,460
You are not hungry?

385
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,270
Or do you want me to feed you?

386
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,390
Before we have dinner,

387
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,410
shouldn't you explain

388
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,780
why you denied we're in a relationship

389
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,250
in front of Chen Shi today?

390
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,650
Before I tell you,

391
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,410
can you take a bite?

392
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,840
Why did you deny that we're in a relationship?

393
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,780
Because I don't want our colleagues

394
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,480
to gossip about

395
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,540
our relationship.

396
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,690
Besides,

397
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,440
Katy told me

398
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,640
an office romance is a curse.

399
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,220
Her relationship with Leo

400
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,160
only lasted for less than three months

401
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,420
because they couldn't stand how everyone thought of them.

402
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,440
That's them, not us.

403
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,930
We won't be like that.

404
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,640
But haven't you heard of this?

405
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,720
A relationship has two results.

406
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,670
Either

407
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,950
we break up ourselves

408
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,680
or

409
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,260
death do us part.

410
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,510
We'll have a different result.

411
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,950
We will never be separated.

412
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,400
Even death can't do us part.

413
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,890
It's not very likely.

414
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,060
You don't believe it?

415
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,620
It's not that I don't believe it.

416
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,610
It's just that

417
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
since we're having an office romance,

418
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,980
every move of ours

419
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,460
will be monitored,

420
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,880
examined closely,

421
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,430
and discussed by them.

422
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,910
It's annoying.

423
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,220
Indeed, it's annoying.

424
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,770
Then what do you plan to do?

425
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,410
I think

426
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,120
if possible,

427
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,620
let's not make it public for the time being, okay?

428
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,650
This can prevent

429
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,000
our relationship from being influenced.

430
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,110
Okay?

431
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,600
Please.

432
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,440
Okay, I promise you.

433
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,640
But you should also promise me something.

434
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,270
No matter what the outside world is like,

435
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,980
you'll believe in our love.

436
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,700
Can we eat now?

437
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,890
I'll think about it.

438
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,730
Don't you want to eat?

439
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,250
Yes, I do.

440
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,510
Aren't you hungry yet?

441
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,730
I'm very hungry.

442
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,080
Do you want to eat it by yourself or should I feed you?

443
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,210
I want you to feed me.

444
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,370
Are you a giant baby?

445
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,580
[Yoga]

446
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,660
How come it's you?

447
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,080
I'm the substitute teacher here.

448
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,850
So you're here for the yoga class, too?

449
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,510
I'm here to explore my soul,

450
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,720
experience life

451
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,480
and learn about myself.

452
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,050
Did you suffer a setback in a love relationship

453
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,150
and get rejected by someone you liked when you confessed your love?

454
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,480
Were you despised by the girl you liked

455
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,700
because you had no aspirations or dreams?

456
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,550
You must have found that

457
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,940
you're an empty shell without a soul,

458
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,910
so you want to achieve self-growth.

459
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,510
How come you guys know it all?

460
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,780
Because...

461
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,650
it's the same to us.

462
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,320
Otherwise, who would come to explore their souls for no reason?

463
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,550
It's almost time.

464
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,000
Let's start the class.

465
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,540
Alright. Bend your

466
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,270
right knee,

467
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,840
and put this leg outside the other thigh.

468
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,210
Wrap your thigh

469
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,780
with one hand.

470
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,830
Turn the other hand inwardly,

471
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,800
and then stretch it backwards.

472
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,040
Put it behind your hips and stretch it.

473
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,520
Look straight at the back.

474
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,510
Turn it inwardly and stretch it backwards.

475
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,370
Look straight at the back.

476
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,890
Are you okay?

477
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,780
Why are you sweating so much?

478
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,930
I don't know, either.

479
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,970
I think the reason why I'm sweating so much

480
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,030
is that my heart is beating very fast.

481
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,510
Alright. Finally,

482
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,320
I'll guide you to meditate with a peaceful mind.

483
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,890
Cross your legs.

484
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,270
Put your feet together.

485
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,470
Put your hands on your knees with the gesture of Om.

486
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,030
Keep your back straight.

487
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,020
Keep your eyes slightly closed.

488
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,800
Come on. Take a deep breath.

489
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,120
Breathe out.

490
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,150
Breathe in.

491
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,720
Breathe out.

492
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,010
Breathe in.

493
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,280
That's all for our class today.

494
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,120
Namaste.

495
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,340
Thank you, everyone.

496
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,760
Thank you, Ma'am.

497
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,910
I think this course is good.

498
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,280
In today's meditation, it was easy to get into the state.

499
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,180
The teacher is very gentle too.

500
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,980
I think we can buy group lessons.

501
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,160
How tired is he?

502
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,650
Sir.

503
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,210
It's all right.

504
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,930
Just let him rest here.

505
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,290
Okay.

506
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,900
Class is over and let's leave.

507
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,780
Thank you, Ma'am.

508
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,190
Bye.

509
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,970
Thank you.

510
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,250
Bye.

511
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,320
Drink more water after you go back.

512
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,820
What do you like about me?

513
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,250
It's just a receipt.

514
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,450
But you just left it lying around.

515
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,230
Chen Shi.

516
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,680
For Mr. Huang's contract we mentioned this morning,

517
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,110
you didn't take records detailedly and clearly.

518
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,510
I want to check it with you again.

519
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,970
It's not detailed enough?

520
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,180
Chen Shi.

521
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,240
Please handle things in order of arrival.

522
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,440
You should give me the receipt first.

523
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,820
It's all right for me.

524
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,680
Just deal with the receipt first.

525
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,220
Keke.

526
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,110
Our manager was just

527
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,910
a little enthusiastic that day.

528
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,050
Actually,

529
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,110
your attitude has made him feel hurt.

530
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,750
I don't feel hurt.

531
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Of course you do.

532
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,360
You've been startled the whole afternoon,

533
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,130
and can't keep focused.

534
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,200
I...

535
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,510
I... I was just...

536
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,710
I was just scared.

537
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,450
How come a friendly greeting

538
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,530
between colleagues

539
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,530
is considered as a way to pester her?

540
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,820
How come there is someone

541
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,280
who is more narcissistic than Michael Zhao?

542
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,140
Chen Shi, help me tell the person over there.

543
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,140
That's because he smiled with the look that

544
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,740
he had an ulterior motive,

545
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,560
which made his colleague think that

546
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,890
she was being pestered.

547
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,960
She asked me to tell you that

548
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,250
your smile looked...

549
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Chen Shi, tell the person over there

550
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,810
to stop her

551
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,980
unnecessary fantasies.

552
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,240
He asked me to...

553
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,380
I can't believe that Jiali is still here.

554
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,410
Is she

555
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,060
waiting for me?

556
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,740
You don't even like me,

557
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,440
but you're so considerate towards me.

558
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,770
In this case,

559
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,150
it's hard for me not to like you.

560
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Why did you slap yourself?

561
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,120
I was trying to kill a mosquito.

562
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,000
Trying to kill a mosquito?

563
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,380
I failed to kill it.

564
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,340
It flew away.

565
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,280
I'm sorry

566
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,220
for keeping you waiting for me for so long,

567
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,280
You even had to stay here after class.

568
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,740
It's all right.

569
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,470
I don't have class anyway.

570
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,540
Next time, I'll get enough sleep before I attend class.

571
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,740
Do you want to leave here with me?

572
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,650
It's okay. You can go home first.

573
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,650
I still have to clean the classroom.

574
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,480
I'll get going then.

575
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,640
Bye.

576
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,830
Bye.

577
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,520
Didn't it hurt when he slapped

578
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,710
himself just now?

579
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,380
Our company's network is so slow.

580
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,450
I got it.

581
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,150
That's all for the new procedure of the application for funds.

582
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,610
Do you have any questions?

583
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,080
Yes.

584
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:24,680
I'm thinking

585
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,280
whether we should have lunch together later.

586
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,180
I've bought meal vouchers for the American restaurant

587
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,730
that is across our company.

588
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,240
You didn't even ask us first

589
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,640
before you bought the meal vouchers for us?

590
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,150
Well,

591
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,840
I don't think anyone will refuse

592
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,360
my invitation, right?

593
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,930
What?

594
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,350
I'll go with you.

595
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,770
You'll go with me?

596
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,600
Why should I refuse?

597
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,720
Okay.

598
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,320
Let's go now.

599
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,650
I'm not going.

600
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,910
I have to sort out the financial reports.

601
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,310
I'm not going, either.

602
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,480
I have something else to do later.

603
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,280
Well,

604
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,950
having lunch

605
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,750
won't take too much of your time.

606
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,950
I don't want to eat American food today.

607
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,510
It's okay.

608
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,220
Let's find out

609
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,880
what other cooperative restaurants they have.

610
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,650
There's a Japanese restaurant.

611
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,910
I don't want to eat Japanese food today.

612
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,980
Wait a moment.

613
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,210
How about eating Taiwanese food?

614
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,070
-I'm tired of it.
-I'm tired of it.

615
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,360
You two have such a good tacit understanding.

616
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,390
Actually, it doesn't matter what we eat.

617
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,860
What matters is whom you eat with.

618
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,110
Right.

619
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,730
If you eat with the right person,

620
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,480
even cheap snacks

621
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,900
will become delicacies.

622
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,909
If you eat with the wrong person,

623
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,620
you'll suffer from indigestion,

624
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,480
and it'll be hard to swallow food.

625
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,580
So you mean

626
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,120
eating with me

627
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,550
will make you suffer from indigestion?

628
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,360
I don't want to eat with you, either.

629
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,310
So now,

630
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,179
the person leaving first is more domineering?

631
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,679
What on earth are the grudges between them?

632
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,020
I don't know.

633
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,570
Are you really going to eat with me?

634
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,490
Why not?

635
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,010
Alright. Let me tell you.

636
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,750
For this restaurant where we're going to have lunch,

637
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,650
if you buy meal vouchers on the cashback app,

638
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,520
it's not only cheap,

639
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,550
but you can also get cash back.

640
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,080
It's really such a bargain.

641
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,130
Look.

642
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,310
This is the amount of my cashback.

643
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,670
That's really a lot.

644
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,670
However,

645
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,260
since when have you become such a petty bourgeoisie?

646
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,990
It was Keke who told me about it.

647
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,110
Let me take a look.

648
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,310
You can order a lot of things on this app.

649
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,840
You can book movie tickets,

650
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,460
and even a hotel room.

651
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,080
If you don't like this one,

652
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,540
we can book another hotel.

653
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,380
Look.

654
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,510
Are you hungry?

655
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,480
I've specially brought your favorite

656
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,720
series of food.

657
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,670
Thank you.

658
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,280
Your performance today

659
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,920
-was really...
-It was really good, right?

660
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,320
I even watched TV dramas particularly to make preparations.

661
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
It was really bad.

662
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,610
What did you mean by suffering from indigestion?

663
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,350
You didn't sound fierce at all.

664
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,310
Was it very bad?

665
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,280
It was super bad.

666
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,610
Don't force me.

667
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,640
This is the extremity of the harshest words

668
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,680
which I can think of to say to you.

669
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,430
Your extremity is...

670
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,860
just like this?

671
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,140
Am I making things too difficult for you?

672
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,950
I want to cry.

673
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,350
How about this?

674
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,180
I got it.

675
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,150
Next time,

676
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,940
I'll write the lines first.

677
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,410
Then you just need to scold me according to the lines.

678
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,160
Really?

679
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,310
I'll write those lines that sound super fierce and...

680
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,240
Hello, Mrs. Landlady. Today, I...

681
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,900
Let me tell you.

682
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,850
You guys from the Business Department always reported the costs arbitrarily.

683
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,380
If you do this again, I won't approve the application next time.

684
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,700
What a crazy woman.

685
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,240
Obviously, she didn't even check the accounts clearly.

686
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,360
What's going on?

687
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,120
Is the Accounting Department of your company just like that?

688
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,520
It's really making me...

689
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,650
suffer from indigestion.

690
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,670
Mrs. Landlady.

691
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,410
I'm not scolding you.

692
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,040
It's a colleague of mine,

693
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
and he's very rude.

694
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:05,950
Ms. Liu.

695
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,810
The content we discussed last time

696
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,540
has been added to the contract.

697
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,320
You can sign the contract after you confirm that there are no problems.

698
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,550
There are no problems with this contract.

699
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,880
I agree to sign it.

700
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,280
But I heard that

701
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,820
you lost to Division One last month in terms of sales performance.

702
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,380
Do you need my help to raise the price

703
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,040
so that you can win this month?

704
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,310
No need.

705
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,270
The content I've negotiated for you

706
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,930
is the best condition for you.

707
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,430
Raising the price again will only increase your cost.

708
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,610
It's unnecessary and meaningless.

709
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,440
You're such a considerate and excellent man.

710
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,610
No wonder Ms. Fang strongly recommended to me that

711
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,210
I should cooperate with you.

712
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,750
Come on. A toast to you.

713
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,230
Ms. Liu.

714
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,450
What a coincidence.

715
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,050
You're here for dinner, too.

716
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,750
I'm here to talk about business.

717
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,590
What's the matter?

718
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,080
I just came over to say hello.

719
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,440
I want to tell you that if there's a chance,

720
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,900
I'd like to invite you to have dinner with me.

721
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,890
Please come to my wedding.

722
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,630
Not only Haikuo,

723
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,870
but also everybody else should come.

724
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,870
I'm very busy.

725
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,850
Make an appointment with my secretary.

726
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,500
Okay.

727
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,590
I'll make an appointment with your secretary.

728
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,250
I won't bother you any longer.

729
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,530
Sorry to keep you waiting.

730
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,250
That is Eric, whom I mentioned to you last time.

731
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,350
He's fickle in love.

732
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,680
He changes his girlfriend every few days.

733
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,640
Baby, good luck at work.

734
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,170
I'll pick you up after work.

735
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,510
I love you.

736
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,010
Bye.

737
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:16,470
Bye.

738
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,280
Elly.

739
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,540
Your fiance is so considerate.

740
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,810
Not only did he prepare breakfast for you,

741
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,810
but he also prepared breakfast for us.

742
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,800
If he had not been so attentive and considerate,

743
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,930
how could he have become my boyfriend?

744
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,100
I thought that

745
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,950
Joan's husband was perfect enough.

746
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,050
I didn't expect that after your fiance appeared,

747
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,910
he would defeat all the other men.

748
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,250
So,

749
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,210
getting married early is not necessarily a good thing.

750
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,870
A woman who made a careful selection like me

751
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,330
is the final winner.

752
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,250
This is really a win-win situation for you.

753
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,580
You have both wealth and love.

754
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,040
You're such a happy woman.

755
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,650
Let's go.

756
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,050
Come on. Let's go to work.

757
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,290
-I'm so happy.
-I'm so envious.

758
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,430
Before going to work, we...

759
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,220
Elly!

760
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,310
Yesterday, I saw Eric

761
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,040
have dinner with another girl at the restaurant.

762
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,980
He got to know a female client in the business market

763
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,650
and needed to socialize with her.

764
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,140
That is something quite normal.

765
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,280
I can't always make a big fuss about it as his fiancee.

766
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,210
My client told me that

767
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,050
Eric is fickle in love.

768
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,210
He has many girlfriends outside.

769
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,330
It's just a rumor.

770
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,580
It may not be true.

771
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

772
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,420
Don't be so muddled. Okay?

773
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,720
I'm worried that you'll be cheated by a scumbag.

774
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,110
You want to sow discord between Eric and me

775
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,510
with something you've heard from others.

776
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,170
What on earth is your purpose?

777
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,310
I'm not trying to sow discord.

778
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,850
I have evidence.

779
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,730
Michael Zhao.

780
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,350
If you don't want to see me live happily,

781
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,980
please get out of my sight,

782
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,480
go as far as you can,

783
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,490
and never

784
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,910
talk to me again!

785
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,570
Elly.

786
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,990
Calm down first.

787
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,010
I think

788
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,820
there might be a misunderstanding.

789
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,430
What's more, I think Michael Zhao

790
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,110
just cares about you.

791
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,170
Yeah.

792
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,600
Don't be so angry.

793
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,140
I'm doomed.

794
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,340
I'm really doomed this time.

795
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,950
No, you won't be doomed.

796
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,730
There are so many people chasing you anyway.

797
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,500
Right.

798
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,630
You'll meet a better one in the future.

799
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,550
I've fallen for him thoroughly.

800
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,360
I'm really doomed this time.

801
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,290
Why is she so deeply in love this time?

802
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,600
I think Eric

803
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,400
is actually very ordinary.

804
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,100
I won't eat it.

805
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,560
What about me?

806
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,920
Give it to someone else.

807
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,250
Excuse me. Well...

808
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,820
I'd like to give this breakfast to you.

809
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,620
Don't knock your head like this.

810
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,200
You can talk to the person in charge directly next time.

811
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,900
Okay.

812
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,850
Help me take this to my office.

813
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,110
I'll come to you later.

814
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,690
You said that

815
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,930
Eric has another woman outside.

816
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,180
Is that true?

817
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,300
However,

818
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,520
why did you have such a big reaction

819
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,850
to Elly's misfortunes?

820
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,060
What do you mean?

821
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,020
Do you have a sore throat?

822
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,440
Then why aren't you saying anything?

823
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,550
That's because

824
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,940
Elly told me

825
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,810
not to talk to her.

826
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,440
That's why I've started reviewing the sign language I learned.

827
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,310
Alright.

828
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,130
Whatever. That's not the point.

829
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,210
The point is that

830
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,150
we dragged you inside here

831
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,080
in order to tell you a piece of news.

832
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,710
What news is it?

833
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,340
We've just learned that

834
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,510
Elly and Eric

835
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,930
will have a date tonight.

836
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,880
And they're going to...

837
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,110
-get a room.
-get a room.

838
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,570
[Preview]

839
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,600
Everyone in the group says that

840
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,320
Keke is going to treat us harshly.

841
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,280
-Please!
-Wait!

842
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,210
I thought that

843
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,600
people were only interested in gossip about mutual love.

844
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,620
I didn't expect that in terms of mutual hatred,

845
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,510
they could make up so many stories.

846
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,830
Just figure out a solution.

847
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,240
It's my fault.

848
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,380
-Elly.
-Elly.

849
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,920
-What are you doing?
-Elly!

850
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,110
Bastard!

851
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,530
Are you acquainted with the teacher?

852
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,680
I like her,

853
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,830
and I'm chasing her.

854
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,420
This is the ideal girlfriend he's been looking for.

855
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,280
This girl

856
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,210
doesn't deserve to marry into our family.

857
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,060
Let's go.
