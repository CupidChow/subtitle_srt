[Episode 18]

4
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,289
What did you break this time?

5
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,030
The plates.

6
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,420
Okay, stop washing.

7
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,720
I will wash them.

8
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,840
There are only a few dishes left. I'll finish washing them.

9
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,250
When you're done,

10
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,410
the dishes will all be broken.

11
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,830
What should we use for dinner tomorrow?

12
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,479
Alright, come on.

13
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,080
Sit down.

14
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,509
Let me ask you.

15
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,240
Is something bothering you?

16
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,320
You're usually so agile.

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,520
What happened today?

18
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,960
Yuanchong

19
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,520
said he wanted to invest in my shop

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,860
with his money.

21
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,890
That's great.

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,760
Don't you need money to open a shop?

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
In this way,

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,730
you don't need to worry about money.

25
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,440
But I don't know

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,350
whether he really values my ability

27
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,960
or just because he likes me.

28
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,090
What should I do if I make him

29
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,890
lose money?

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,650
Besides,

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,030
this is his savings for a long time.

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,870
I can't accept it.

33
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,470
Jiali.

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,579
Do you

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,050
like Yuanchong?

36
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,070
No.

37
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,570
No?

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,750
Then why do you worry so much?

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,870
You think so much for him.

40
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,200
There must be

41
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,490
a little bit

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,090
of affection, right?

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,680
Think about it.

44
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,350
I'm going to wash the dishes.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,810
Did I really fall in love with Yuanchong?

46
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,530
I love him.

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,140
I can't leave him.

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,200
Uncle, I beg you.

49
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,000
I beg you.

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,490
Let go!

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,630
Let go of me!

52
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,390
Let me tell you.

53
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,329
Yingjun

54
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,530
is the successor

55
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,640
of our W Group.

56
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,420
You are an ordinary office worker without any background

57
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,329
or family connections.

58
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,870
Who are you to be with him?

59
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,400
Zeng Yingjun's father is really snobbish.

60
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,280
What's so great about being rich?

61
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,230
Rich people can be willful.

62
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,360
Later,

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,130
he'll give money to that woman.

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,400
I won't mistreat you.

65
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,590
This money is enough for you to live.

66
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,410
See?

67
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,240
I can be a screenwriter now.

68
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,620
It's an old cliché.

69
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,120
It's because these old clichés

70
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,440
happen in real life

71
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,290
that such stories keep being made.

72
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,760
Young people nowadays are free in love.

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,520
Whose parents would intervene

74
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
and even pay money to send someone away?

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,380
No!

76
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,900
You just haven't seen enough.

77
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,220
Me?

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,890
Things like loving someone without family approval,

79
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,930
being forced to leave,

80
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,520
and being unable to stay together,

81
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,470
really do happen in life.

82
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,220
That feeling

83
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,860
is like being abandoned by the world.

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,630
It's really hurtful,

85
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,720
painful,

86
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,980
and sad.

87
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,840
People who haven't experienced it won't understand.

88
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,660
You're weird.

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,270
I...

90
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,850
I'm just too immersed in the role.

91
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,680
Weird how?

92
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,730
Is that so?

93
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,590
Yeah.

94
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,430
Is it that Haikuo's father also...

95
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,390
How do you know?

96
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,370
Gave you money and asked you to leave?

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,430
How do you know?

98
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,160
What did you say to him?

99
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,610
I...

100
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,120
Of course, I didn't cry like her,

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,110
so weak.

102
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,400
I just...

103
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,750
You want me to leave Haikuo?

104
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,780
That's right.

105
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,460
Could it be that you just want to give me a sum of money

106
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,590
to make me leave him?

107
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,420
Listen.

108
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,659
Even if you gave me billions,

109
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,860
I wouldn't leave him.

110
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,390
Then I want to see

111
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,340
just how determined you are.

112
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,220
This is the contract I prepared

113
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,860
to sign with your company.

114
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,040
You want me to leave Haikuo

115
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,030
and also want to sign a contract with our company.

116
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,040
What exactly are you trying to do?

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,180
As long as you can convince Haikuo

118
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,120
to come to me personally to discuss this business,

119
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,560
not only will it bring a billion-NTD order

120
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
to your company,

121
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,740
but I will also agree

122
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,460
to you dating Haikuo.

123
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,360
A billion-NTD order?

124
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,450
Just the commission alone

125
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,920
could pay the down payment on a house.

126
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,240
Keke.

127
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,870
You wouldn't just watch this money slip away, would you?

128
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,250
You're Haikuo's father.

129
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,520
It should be easy

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,980
for you to see him.

131
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,000
But Haikuo considers you dead.

132
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,250
It means your relationship isn't good.

133
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,390
What exactly is your purpose?

134
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,070
That's right.

135
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,740
There are indeed

136
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,210
significant issues between my son and me.

137
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,770
So, I sought you out,

138
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,290
hoping you could

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,060
help mend our relationship.

140
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,950
After all,

141
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,920
you are the only one

142
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,510
who can speak to him

143
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,540
on my behalf now.

144
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,330
So now I have to find a way

145
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,930
to help them reconcile.

146
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,900
Earlier, Elly noticed

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,220
that he rarely mentions his family.

148
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,659
I asked Haikuo before.

149
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,720
He told me

150
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,190
his

151
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,850
whole family was dead.

152
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,190
Oh my.

153
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,500
Why did he talk so grimly?

154
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,020
What kind of feud

155
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,340
could lead to this?

156
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,350
Did his father tell you?

157
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,610
But Haikuo did tell me before

158
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,750
that during his mother’s final moments,

159
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,410
he was the only one by her side.

160
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,310
His father doesn't care at all.

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,800
He didn't even pay a visit.

162
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,290
So heartless?

163
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,440
Such a man

164
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,780
deserves to die.

165
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,430
Really.

166
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,660
Honey, don't worry.

167
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,820
When you're dying,

168
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,290
I’ll be right by your side,

169
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,190
never leaving you.

170
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,780
Although you mean no harm,

171
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,150
it feels like

172
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,419
a curse.

173
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,429
No, you misunderstood.

174
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,080
I’m just afraid you’ll be lonely

175
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,760
with no one to take care of you.

176
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,150
You better mean it.

177
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,860
I think this isn’t simple.

178
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,170
What are you planning to do?

179
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know.

180
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,590
I’m still figuring it out.

181
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,210
They say

182
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,120
even a fair judge can hardly resolve family disputes.

183
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,680
Why are you here?

184
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,380
I came to ask

185
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,380
if you’re toying with Yuanchong’s feelings.

186
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,070
I'm not.

187
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,350
Why would you say that?

188
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,880
Because I saw

189
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,430
you both go out

190
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,600
after work that day.

191
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,680
Your expression was different.

192
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,890
You were smiling so happily.

193
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,870
And it was genuine.

194
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,650
You never smiled at him like that before.

195
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,760
Really?

196
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,730
Did I?

197
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,380
I was just starting to admire you.

198
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,790
Don't disappoint me.

199
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,560
Don’t turn into the kind

200
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,620
of scheming woman I despise the most.

201
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,460
I just don't want to become that kind of person.

202
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,990
So I've been hesitating

203
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,270
about whether to accept his investment.

204
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,370
He wants to invest in you?

205
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,390
Reject him.

206
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,140
Didn't you just tell me

207
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,990
that as long as things are kept clear

208
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,230
and separate, it would be fine?

209
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,160
Now you're asking me to reject him?

210
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,320
Yuanchong has already changed so much for you.

211
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,170
First, he learned baking for you.

212
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,500
After you rejected him,

213
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,430
he didn't give up

214
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,320
and said he would look for some dream.

215
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,580
Now, even without finding that dream,

216
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,980
he wants to invest in you?

217
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,460
Do you think

218
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,650
I would hurt him?

219
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,360
Yuanchong is falling deeper and deeper for you.

220
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,490
Your attitude is the key.

221
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,620
You two are so ambiguous now.

222
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,750
I feel like I need to step in to protect him.

223
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,030
Do you

224
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,340
like Yuanchong?

225
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,200
You think so much for him.

226
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,560
There must be

227
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,810
a little bit

228
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,310
of affection, right?

229
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,320
Don’t accept Yuanchong's investment just because

230
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,800
it benefits you

231
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,700
and turns him into a tool.

232
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,890
I'm not treating him as a tool.

233
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,980
I think

234
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm starting to change my feelings toward Yuanchong.

235
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,050
What kind of change?

236
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,270
I think

237
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,580
I might care about Yuanchong a bit.

238
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,490
You like Chen Shi?

239
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,230
Keep your voice down.

240
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,360
So that's why we wanted you to invite Chen Shi

241
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,960
to the guesthouse with us.

242
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,760
Don't tell him

243
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,910
I like him.

244
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,470
Chen Shi is indeed

245
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,740
a little bit inferior to me

246
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,440
among men.

247
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,060
But he's still a pretty good guy.

248
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,650
You've got good taste.

249
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,540
Yes.

250
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,660
So

251
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,190
will you join us on the trip to the guesthouse?

252
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,470
For Chen Shi's happiness,

253
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,130
sure.

254
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,800
Cheers.

255
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,340
How are things going with Mr. Fang?

256
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:43,900
Mr. Fang...

257
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,780
Mr. Fang...

258
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,390
Mr. Fang has put forth some conditions.

259
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,980
If we can satisfy him,

260
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,270
the benefits of this contract will be considerable.

261
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,230
If we can secure Mr. Fang's contract,

262
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,460
I’ll almost have enough for the down payment on a house.

263
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,610
Otherwise, with housing prices constantly rising,

264
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,110
the salaries never keep pace.

265
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,280
Don't you want your own house

266
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,410
and home?

267
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,290
I think

268
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,130
home is like eating.

269
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,920
What's important is the people,

270
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,720
not what food

271
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,550
or house it is.

272
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
As long as I can be with the one I love,

273
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,480
anywhere is home.

274
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,290
I really like the atmosphere in your family.

275
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,660
Even though

276
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,380
you may speak loudly, argue, and bicker,

277
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,480
you

278
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,800
genuinely care for each other.

279
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,970
Actually,

280
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,660
your dad's love for you

281
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,680
is really admirable.

282
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,710
Haikuo.

283
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,160
Do you also want

284
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,520
to have your own family?

285
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

286
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,320
Don't worry.

287
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,260
I have you now,

288
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,970
as well as Uncle Jian and Auntie Jian.

289
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,870
You are all my family.

290
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,880
Don't worry.

291
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,130
By the way,

292
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,570
I recently met a new friend.

293
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,670
He's very interested in our company's products.

294
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,480
I thought I’d introduce him to you

295
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,740
to see if you can secure an order from him.

296
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,820
Sure, no problem.

297
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,490
You set it up,

298
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,230
and I’ll coordinate on my end.

299
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,540
I've finished my work here.

300
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,440
What about you?

301
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,490
-Done.
-Done.

302
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,530
The girls in our Accounting Department

303
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,650
are indeed efficient.

304
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,710
For the sake of going out to have fun,

305
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,110
our work is twice as effective.

306
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,140
Of course.

307
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,260
Since the work is done,

308
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,890
it's...

309
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,810
Shopping time.

310
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,130
I must take this opportunity

311
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,600
to make Michael Zhao face his true feelings

312
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,800
and confess to me.

313
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,940
This dress is too sexy.

314
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,260
Michael Zhao won't be able

315
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,770
to take his eyes off you.

316
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,460
I'm going to have a nosebleed.

317
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,700
Elly.

318
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,240
You shop online so often.

319
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,520
Do you use cashback?

320
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,450
What is that?

321
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,800
Let me tell you.

322
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,900
Look.

323
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,630
This app.

324
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,190
The clothing website you’re browsing right now

325
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,080
has a partnership with it.

326
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,580
You can get cashback.

327
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,330
Here.

328
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,340
This is it.

329
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,050
Download this cashback app.

330
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,000
See? Click through here.

331
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,460
Whether you're booking a hotel, arranging travel,

332
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,330
ordering food delivery, or shopping online,

333
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,090
you can get high cashback.

334
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,090
Come on, use this

335
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,100
referral code.

336
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,800
After joining it,

337
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,130
you and I will both get a 100 yuan cashback.

338
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,550
I know this app.

339
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,980
Michael Zhao introduced it to me last time.

340
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,599
I'll download it right away.

341
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,720
Speaking of Michael Zhao,

342
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,849
your eyes are all pink and bubbly.

343
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,839
Then I’ll download it too.

344
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,790
-That gives us another chance.
-I’m telling you.

345
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,530
This way.

346
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,190
You both owe me your 100 yuan cashback.

347
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,220
Okay.

348
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,020
-Here.
-This one.

349
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,619
Yes.

350
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,030
You were supposed to give me 300,

351
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,960
but you only gave me 200.

352
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
If I hadn't caught it today,

353
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
you would've taken that 100.

354
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,190
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,660
I'm sorry.

356
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,250
I will conduct more employee training.

357
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,570
My apologies.

358
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,470
Qianqian.

359
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,890
Since you started working here,

360
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,290
you've never made a mistake.

361
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,130
What happened today?

362
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,140
You seem a bit off.

363
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,080
Manager, I'm sorry.

364
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,610
I'll be more careful.

365
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,570
Cheer up.

366
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,790
Here, this is for you.

367
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,830
Hello.

368
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,870
I brought some desserts for you all.

369
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,720
These desserts aren't cheap.

370
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,030
Money is no longer an issue for me.

371
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,390
I'm going to be rich soon.

372
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,590
What do you mean?

373
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,940
Did you win the lottery?

374
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,910
No.

375
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,330
I picked

376
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,720
a very promising investment target

377
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,680
and I'm going to be rich soon.

378
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,570
Investment target?

379
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,430
Stocks, bonds,

380
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,840
funds, or ETFs?

381
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,740
None of those.

382
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,810
Just eat.

383
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,780
I'll tell you when I make the money.

384
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,230
Jiali, are you off work?

385
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,050
I'll give you a ride home.

386
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,670
Okay.

387
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,170
Yuanchong.

388
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,090
Well...

389
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,530
After work today,

390
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,520
I want to buy some computer parts.

391
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,800
Come with me.

392
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,420
Is it urgent?

393
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,470
-Can we do it another day...
-No!

394
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
It has to be today.

395
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,770
But I've already arranged

396
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,860
to go with Jiali...

397
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,680
Jiali.

398
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,760
Jiali.

399
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,690
It's always Jiali.

400
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,400
Is Jiali's matter that important?

401
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,690
My matters are just casual

402
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,690
and can be postponed to another day.

403
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,100
It's not that. It's just...

404
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,780
Qianqian.

405
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,730
Why are you acting so differently today?

406
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,260
You usually don't blame Yuanchong like this.

407
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,290
Maybe she's really in a hurry

408
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,020
to buy that computer part, so...

409
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,750
I don't need you to speak for me.

410
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,810
Why are you talking so aggressively?

411
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,910
This...

412
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,790
This was originally

413
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,990
a matter between the two of us.

414
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,510
It has nothing to do with her.

415
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,190
Even so,

416
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,570
you shouldn't speak so aggressively.

417
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,850
Jiali is even speaking up for you.

418
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,990
Enough.

419
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,780
You're scolding me!

420
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,360
Li Yuanchong.

421
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,480
I... I know you like her.

422
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,650
But you can't scold me because of her.

423
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,870
You...

424
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,350
You're putting romance before friendship!

425
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,100
Is she crying?

426
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,790
Yuanchong, you made a girl cry.

427
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,600
She...

428
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,430
What's wrong with her?

429
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,080
Go check on her quickly.

430
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,810
Wait for me.

431
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,930
Why are you crying?

432
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,480
I just said a few words.

433
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,310
Do you need to be so emotional?

434
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,030
Yuanchong.

435
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,510
I've still lost you.

436
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,870
But...

437
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,150
You never had me.

438
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,860
You're right.

439
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,910
Kind of makes sense.

440
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,870
All along,

441
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,860
you've only seen me as a junior.

442
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,420
I was the one who held onto hope.

443
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,570
Calling you senior

444
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,220
while hoping

445
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,550
one day it could be more than that.

446
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,280
I like

447
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,560
Jiali.

448
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,250
Looking at me like that

449
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,830
won't change my feelings.

450
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,090
You...

451
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,120
Please stay calm.

452
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,160
Don't act impulsively.

453
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,390
Even if you force me,

454
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,660
I won't change my mind.

455
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,880
I just wanted to tell you

456
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,420
that Jiali said

457
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,210
she has started to have some feelings for you.

458
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,570
Manager, where's Jiali?

459
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,820
When you went to the break room to find Qianqian,

460
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,920
Jiali went home.

461
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,520
Didn't I tell her to wait for me?

462
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,430
She probably guessed

463
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,520
that I would tell you

464
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,080
she had some feelings for you,

465
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,130
so she went home.

466
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,930
Why did you run away?

467
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,590
Well.

468
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,370
He confessed to me before.

469
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,700
I rejected him.

470
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,160
And I told him

471
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,810
I thought of him as my brother.

472
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,050
Now that I've started liking him.

473
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,890
It feels so embarrassing.

474
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,970
I don't know what I'm doing.

475
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,020
When it comes to love,

476
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,450
if you know what you're doing,

477
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,420
it's not called love.

478
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,620
It's the uncertainty that makes it fun.

479
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,790
Then,

480
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,740
do you think I should accept his investment?

481
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,670
Of course not.

482
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,690
When it comes to money,

483
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,510
whether it's family affection, love, or friendship,

484
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,990
no matter how good the relationship is,

485
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,620
it gets too complicated

486
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,910
once money is involved.

487
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,300
The way you put it...

488
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,010
What's going on between you and Haikuo again?

489
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,530
It's like

490
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,710
a soap opera:

491
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,660
family and money drama.

492
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,090
Family?

493
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,790
I thought he had no family.

494
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,730
I thought so too,

495
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,450
but suddenly his dad showed up.

496
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,740
They don't get along,

497
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,740
and his dad tried to

498
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,440
bribe me

499
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,030
to reconcile them.

500
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,140
Your problem is trickier than mine.

501
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,650
Indeed.

502
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,910
I didn't want to get involved,

503
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,070
but Haikuo

504
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,840
seems to want family,

505
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,900
so I thought

506
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,750
I'd help.

507
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,740
I really hope

508
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,700
Haikuo can have a good relationship with his family.

509
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,300
Thank you.

510
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,550
Try this. It's delicious.

511
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,080
Chen Shi.

512
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,390
I heard Yu Fen loves meat.

513
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,350
Give her a piece.

514
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,070
Yu Fen, this is for you.

515
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,500
Katy.

516
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,900
The chicken wings are ready.

517
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,570
Do you want some?

518
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,540
Yes, thank you.

519
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,510
Wait.

520
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,920
Chen Shi.

521
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,000
I heard Yu Fen also likes chicken wings.

522
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,770
Let her

523
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,130
have it first.

524
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,400
Sure, give it to her.

525
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,250
Here.

526
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,380
I'm stuffed.

527
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,300
I'm starving.

528
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,660
Eat this.

529
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,130
Where is Elly?

530
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,920
Why didn't she come to the BBQ?

531
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,170
Elly's legs

532
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,030
are stunning.

533
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,070
Michael Zhao can't

534
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,350
take his eyes off them.

535
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,760
As long as Elly shows her legs,

536
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,010
Michael Zhao will fall for her.

537
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,950
Your meat

538
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,750
is about to burn.

539
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,550
You...

540
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,200
Why are you staring at me?

541
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,890
Your legs are slim

542
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,860
but need more muscle,

543
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,410
and they're a bit O-shaped.

544
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,950
I recommend

545
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,670
watching this video

546
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,900
to fix them.

547
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,850
I do it every day. Look.

548
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,110
Look at this.

549
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,560
There's a pool over there.

550
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,170
Yeah, let's play in the water.

551
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,230
Yes, let's go.

552
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,600
Let's play in the water.

553
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,450
Is it nice?

554
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,380
Yes.

555
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,270
Join us.

556
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,350
Elly,

557
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,840
you are so beautiful.

558
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,280
Elly, why are you laughing?

559
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,520
Go play in the water.

560
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,390
It's cool.

561
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,920
Right, go play in the water.

562
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,070
Michael Zhao.

563
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,180
Do you want to

564
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,060
join me for some water fun?

565
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,390
Sure.

566
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,170
Is it fun?

567
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,470
Play water splashing with me.

568
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,440
Yes.

569
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,660
I'm the best at it.

570
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,620
No one can beat me at water splashing.

571
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,890
Let me show you how it's done.

572
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,730
Back in the day, I was known

573
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,780
as the Freshwater Prince.

574
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,580
By the river,

575
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,360
I could splash

576
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,930
without even blinking.

577
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,080
Impressive, right?

578
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,650
Freshwater Prince, huh?

579
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,930
I'm the Freshwater Prince's mother.

580
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,880
Come here!

581
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,440
Freshwater Prince, huh?

582
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,210
Mom, I don't dare!

583
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,230
I'm your mom!

584
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,600
Mom, I won't do it again!

585
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,840
You won't?

586
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,130
I love you, Mom.

587
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,190
This is not how I imagined it.

588
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,560
Elly is so powerful and aggressive.

589
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,350
Michael Zhao.

590
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,130
I love you.

591
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,680
This is not how I imagined it.

592
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,600
Did you

593
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,220
have fun today?

594
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,090
You had fun.

595
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,590
But I didn't.

596
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,880
You didn't treat me like a woman.

597
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,540
When we were playing in the water,

598
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,530
you kept attacking me so hard.

599
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,650
I played with you for over an hour.

600
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,790
You should

601
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,080
see me

602
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,460
as a considerate woman.

603
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,390
I have a question for you.

604
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,390
Answer me honestly.

605
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,200
Since you saved me,

606
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,240
I feel

607
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,610
there's something different

608
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,010
growing

609
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,260
between us.

610
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,290
So,

611
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,830
am I

612
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,540
your type?

613
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,070
You like tempura, right?

614
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,030
Here, have some.

615
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,260
How did you know?

616
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,870
I noticed you ate a lot tempura,

617
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,310
so I thought you liked it.

618
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,380
So you've been observing me?

619
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,880
No, I just...

620
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,830
What are you two doing?

621
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,150
What are you doing?

622
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,550
Why aren't Michael Zhao and Elly

623
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,130
coming over for the BBQ?

624
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,190
Yeah,

625
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,890
what are they doing?

626
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,880
Why are they staring at each other?

627
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,990
Did their conversation fail?

628
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,930
Fail at what?

629
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,480
Relationship.

630
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,760
Their relationship.

631
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,570
Relationship?

632
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,390
It's burning.

633
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,470
Let's check on them.

634
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,830
Bring them some food.

635
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,440
Guys,

636
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,890
Chen Shi is quite good at BBQ.

637
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,090
Have some.

638
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,940
Yeah,

639
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,200
even if the talk didn't go well,

640
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,790
we're still colleagues.

641
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,340
Don't let it get awkward.

642
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,500
Right, Michael Zhao.

643
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,440
You're a man.

644
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,060
Be more accommodating.

645
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,179
Michael Zhao, you...

646
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,219
What's wrong?

647
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,440
He...

648
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,440
He's snoring.

649
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,989
He's asleep?

650
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,300
Elly.

651
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,650
She's asleep too.

652
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,139
How can they sleep like this?

653
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:29,320
Turns out Michael Zhao sleeps with his eyes open too.

654
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:31,949
They're a perfect match.

655
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,179
Drink more.

656
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,540
This mung bean soup will cool you down.

657
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,730
-Thank you, Grandma.
-Drink more.

658
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,889
Yuanchong?

659
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,690
You're finally back.

660
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,730
Yuanchong has been waiting for you.

661
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,980
I'll go

662
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,290
put away what I bought.

663
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,540
No need, I'll do it.

664
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,670
You...

665
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,260
You two chat.

666
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,210
-You…
-You...

667
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,750
You go first.

668
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,610
It's okay.

669
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,620
You came to see me.

670
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,590
You go first.

671
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,010
Alright.

672
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,950
These are some stores I found online.

673
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,380
You can choose the ones you like,

674
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,320
and then we can see them offline.

675
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,310
You found so much information?

676
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,800
You could have just

677
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,910
sent it to Jiali on her phone.

678
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,510
Why did you print it out?

679
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,730
You came here

680
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,870
specifically to see Jiali,

681
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,810
didn't you?

682
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,280
Grandma!

683
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,320
Aren't you putting away things for me?

684
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,980
Why are you eavesdropping on our conversation?

685
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,460
You two were too slow.

686
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,740
It was driving me crazy!

687
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,960
I just wanted to speed things up for you.

688
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,030
Take this back

689
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,270
first.

690
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,670
I'll find a store on my own.

691
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,300
Why?

692
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,960
Are you refusing my investment

693
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,490
because you know I like you?

694
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,780
Jiali,

695
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,890
didn't I tell you

696
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,340
to think about

697
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,350
your feelings for him?

698
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,650
Haven't you thought about it?

699
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,360
I have.

700
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,840
But you still refused him?

701
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,410
Look at him. Yuanchong is so pitiful.

702
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,040
Grandma.

703
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,750
Keke said

704
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,580
it's best for couples

705
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,690
not to mix money

706
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,180
with their relationship.

707
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,450
You want to date him?

708
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,380
You two want to be a couple?

709
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,020
That's great!

710
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,890
Keke is right.

711
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,030
Couples should

712
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,870
avoid financial entanglements.

713
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,920
That's right.

714
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,360
But...

715
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,100
But I want to invest in Jiali's store.

716
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,090
Don't you get it?

717
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,930
Jiali said

718
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,190
couples shouldn't

719
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,440
mix money with their relationship.

720
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,940
So you don't want to be her boyfriend?

721
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,400
No.

722
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,970
I do.

723
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,180
I really do.

724
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,260
Jiali.

725
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,950
I promise I'll make you happy.

726
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,760
Keke,

727
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,580
do you really want to help reconcile them?

728
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,990
I think

729
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,730
it's a thankless task.

730
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,320
I agree.

731
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,550
What if it affects your relationship

732
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,580
with Haikuo?

733
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,300
It won't.

734
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,210
Haikuo and I have a great relationship.

735
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,370
He has a good temper

736
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,170
and doesn't get angry easily.

737
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,060
He might be surprised to see his dad,

738
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,390
but if things get tense,

739
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,060
I'll

740
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,410
smooth things over.

741
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,040
It shouldn't be too awkward.

742
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,130
Just remember,

743
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,690
being a mediator often means pleasing no one.

744
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,490
Got it.

745
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,920
But I want to give it a try.

746
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,140
Okay.

747
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,640
Okay.

748
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,060
Here.

749
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,340
Mr. Jian. Mrs. Jian.

750
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,560
Are you here to pick up Keke?

751
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes.

752
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,810
Okay.

753
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,190
We're leaving.

754
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,190
-Okay.
-Okay. Go.

755
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,430
Bye-bye.

756
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,160
Bye-bye.

757
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,690
Bye-bye.

758
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,250
Haikuo.

759
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,110
Here.

760
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,210
Let me tell you.

761
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,980
No matter what happens,

762
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,870
be more tolerant of Keke.

763
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,280
Mr. Jian, don't worry.

764
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,390
I will treat Keke with kindness

765
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,890
and make her happy.

766
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:22,570
Okay.

767
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,700
I'm leaving.

768
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,330
Bye-bye.

769
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,130
Bye.

770
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,880
How could I fall asleep?

771
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,950
You

772
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,380
must be too tired from playing in the water.

773
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,500
Don't be too upset.

774
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,450
There will be more opportunities.

775
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,250
Creating chances isn't helping.

776
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,500
He fell asleep too.

777
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,340
He didn't hear what I said.

778
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,240
In my opinion,

779
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,470
he's just a fancy piece of wood.

780
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,180
No matter how gentlemanly,

781
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,990
he is just a stiff piece of wood.

782
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,650
I heard someone

783
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,610
talking about stiff wood outside.

784
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,710
Want to see a sacred tree?

785
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,580
Feeling better after a nap?

786
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,190
Much better.

787
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,400
That's great.

788
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,200
Now

789
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,370
drive me home.

790
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,060
I just came to ask

791
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,400
what you want for dinner.

792
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,340
I'm not eating.

793
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,710
I want to leave now.

794
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,460
Take me home.

795
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,630
Elly!

796
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,620
Are you giving up in anger?

797
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,570
No.

798
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,640
I will

799
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,900
hold onto him tightly

800
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,750
and make him understand my feelings.

801
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,450
Hold tightly.

802
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:12,970
Good luck.

803
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,620
Good luck.

804
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Don't be nervous.

805
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,290
Just

806
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,280
leave it to me.

807
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,870
This is your client.

808
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,930
I will try my best

809
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,950
to secure this order for you.

810
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,920
Sorry, I'm late.

811
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,790
Excuse me, sir.

812
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,780
Are you in the wrong room?

813
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,030
No.

814
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,000
I am the client

815
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,990
Keke wants to introduce to you.

816
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,710
You only met him once.

817
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,690
You shouldn't trust strangers so easily.

818
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,740
Haikuo.

819
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,630
I already know he's your father.

820
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,690
I arranged this meeting

821
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,530
so you two can talk.

822
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,430
He's not my father.

823
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,850
I've warned you

824
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,470
not to get close to Jian Keke,

825
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,870
yet you still used her?

826
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,090
She's my son's girlfriend.

827
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,710
I should meet her.

828
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,220
How could you say I'm using her?

829
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,470
We are just strangers.

830
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,740
You have my blood.

831
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,140
Blood ties can't be broken.

832
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,480
No matter how hard you resist,

833
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,570
the fact remains.

834
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,940
We're family after all.

835
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,400
Family?

836
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,850
Do you think you have the right

837
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,550
to talk about family with me? Do you?

838
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,210
Haikuo,

839
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,890
your dad truly wants to reconcile.

840
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,720
He is...

841
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,500
You don't know

842
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,900
what kind of person he is.

843
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,790
Don't speak for him.

844
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,600
Haikuo.

845
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:51,560
Haikuo!

846
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,560
Calm down.

847
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,040
Whatever happened before,

848
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,080
listen to what your dad has to say.

849
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,380
Getting angry won't solve anything.

850
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,440
-Your dad...
-I said,

851
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,470
he's not my dad.

852
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,410
Jian Keke.

853
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,850
My family matters don't need your interference.

854
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,410
Do you have something to say to me?

855
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,850
You haven't given me your home address.

856
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,630
Just drive towards your place.

857
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,550
My place?

858
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,570
Why?

859
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,160
Because starting today,

860
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,450
I'm moving in with you.

861
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,820
I want to live with you.

862
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,310
[Preview]

863
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,860
He just left.

864
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,360
If he breaks up with me tomorrow,

865
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,950
I wouldn't be surprised.

866
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,620
Why are you avoiding me?

867
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,900
I confessed my feelings to you.

868
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,350
What's your answer?

869
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,210
President Wang.

870
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,490
If you genuinely want to

871
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,990
mend your relationship

872
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,570
stop interfering with the people around him.

873
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,170
Are you threatening me?

874
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,940
You care if Elly is sincere to you.

875
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,650
That means

876
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,230
you actually like her too.

877
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:32,830
This is a goodnight kiss.
