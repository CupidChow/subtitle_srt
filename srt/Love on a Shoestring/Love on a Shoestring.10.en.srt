[Episode 10]

5
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,450
No matter if I go to the left

6
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,030
or the right,

7
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,410
I still...

8
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,990
I still can't get through it.

9
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,550
I can't.

10
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,539
Please...

11
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,039
Please don't cry.

12
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:39,740
Well,

13
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,560
I'll find a way to help you, okay?

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,990
Really?

15
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,970
Yes.

16
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,150
Then,

17
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,360
what can I do for Jiali?

18
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,229
Do you have a dream?

19
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,940
A dream?

20
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,550
No.

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm still studying.

22
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,490
I don't know what to do

23
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,740
after graduation.

24
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,070
Maybe I'll take one step at a time.

25
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,520
How about

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,030
you help Jiali fulfill her dream?

27
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,250
What's her dream?

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
Jiali has been improving her baking skills

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,050
because her dream

30
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,950
is to run a small bakery.

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,160
No problem.

32
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,410
I can work together with Jiali to fulfill her dream.

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,950

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,100
Okay.

36
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,990
It smells good.

37
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,420
You're so thin.

38
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,050
Work is important.

39
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,880
But you also need to take care of your health, okay?

40
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,150
We have to pay the insurance bill,

41
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,390
water, and electricity bills next month.

42
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,430
I lost my income in the bakery.

43
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,020
I have to find a proper job as soon as possible.

44
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,250
I still have some savings.

45
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,920
I think we can hold on

46
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,930
for a few months.

47
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,190
Take a good rest now.

48
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,300
Don't make me worry.

49
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,460
Okay, I got it.

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,310
That...

51
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,770
That Yuanchong

52
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,710

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,760
That kid is nice.

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,370
Grandma.

55
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,000
We are just friends.

56
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,329
That's what you said.

57
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,990
You only treat him as a friend.

58
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,620
Does he think the same?

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,250
I'm old now.

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,950
I don't even know when I'll die.

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,570
Grandma.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,460
Grandma, you won't leave me.

63
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,880
You will live a long life

64
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,410
and stay with me forever.

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,180
Right.

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I want to be with you for a long time.

67
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,370
But besides me,

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,660
I hope there is another person

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,730
who can love you, take care of you,

70
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,400
and make you happier.

71
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,510
Then I won't have to worry,

72
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,400
right?

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,540
Thank you for sending me back.

74
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,950
I should thank you for taking care of me these days.

75
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,980
You're welcome.

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,670
How was work today?

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,430
It's okay.

78
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,030
Chen Shi helped a lot.

79
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,159
Your Business Department is under a lot of pressure.

80
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,510
You should pay attention to your diet.

81
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,240
Otherwise, you'll have stomach problems again.

82
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,400
If so,

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,220
will you

84
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,180
make soup for me

85
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,520
and send me breakfast again?

86
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,220
But...

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,090
I'll be spending a lot.

88
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
I can pay for all of these.

89
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,020
I asked Chen Shi.

90
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,460
He said Haikuo rarely talked about his family.

91
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,790
I didn't see his family photos

92
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,400
at his house that day.

93
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,170
Could it be that

94
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,750
he doesn't have a family?

95
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,990
But do you think

96
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,620
it's better to ask your family to help you

97
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,520
with that?

98
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
After all, I'm just your colleague.

99
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,940
My dad died.

100
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,820
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,450
It's okay.

102
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,060
Don't you have any other family?

103
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,990
All my relatives died.

104
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,320
Keke, you're finally home.

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,159
What's wrong?

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,260
Your parents are poisoned and dying.

107
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,880
Dad, are you okay?

108
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm fine.

109
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,560
Sorry for making you worry.

110
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,890
Why did you say you were fine?

111
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,620
Why are you

112
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,420
and mom are both hospitalized?

113
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,200
Well.

114
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,580
It's just that thing.

115
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,680
What?

116
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,440
It was because of that thing.

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,050
Because of what? Tell me.

118
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,630
What caused it?

119
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,340
-What?
-It’s oysters.

120
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,690
Oysters?

121
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,360
Be careful.

122
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,960
Wait. Slow down.

123
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,550
-I can't walk too fast.
-Take your time.

124
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,290
Wait.

125
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,060
I need to walk slowly.

126
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,820
Okay, take your time.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,570
Be careful.

128
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,300
Okay.

129
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,570
How is it? Does it hurt?

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,070
It hurts.

131
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,470
What... What oysters?

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,300
Fried oysters.

133
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,470
Fried oysters?

134
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,650
Why does it smell like this?

135
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,420
It's rotten.

136
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,860
What are you doing?

137
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,320
I'm going to throw it away.

138
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,430
This is oysters.

139
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,380
It's expensive. How can you throw it away?

140
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,790
I know seafood is expensive.

141
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,090
But I smelled it just now.

142
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,780
It smells bad.

143
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,160
No way.

144
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,010
I bought this yesterday.

145
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,070
How can it smell?

146
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,440
There are only two left.

147
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,030
One for you and one for me.

148
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,690
We will swallow it in one bite.

149
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,570
I'm afraid I'll have diarrhea.

150
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,650
You won't.

151
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,850
Okay, how about this?

152
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,040
Let's fry it.

153
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,890
High-temperature frying

154
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,030
can disinfect and sterilize.

155
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,520
It'll also become crispy and delicious.

156
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,080
How is it?

157
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,250
Is it okay?

158
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,700
Listen.

159
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,620
I don’t think

160
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,770
Keke will come back tonight.

161
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,240
Just talk.

162
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,500
Why are you so close to me?

163
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,980
I think

164
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,220
with the stimulation of oysters,

165
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,730
we should have a wonderful night

166
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,070
with just the two of us.

167
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,310
I'll fry it.

168
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,690
I'll fry it right away.

169
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,950
All in all,

170
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,630
I was seduced by your dad.

171
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,140
That's why I'm so weak today.

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,810
But at least,

173
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,140
you were happy.

174
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,860
What are you talking about?

175
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,170
His stomach is weaker than mine.

176
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,340
He stayed in the toilet all night.

177
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,130
He had never been out.

178
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,590
Enough, Honey.

179
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,580
Stop it.

180
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,670
Shut up!

181
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't call me.

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm telling you, when I recover,

183
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,190
I will definitely fry you

184
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,950
in the pot.

185
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,190
Alright.

186
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,420
Don't threaten me.

187
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,090
You scared me.

188
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,770
I can't take it anymore.

189
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,050
I need to use the restroom again.

190
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,790
-Okay. Wait.
-Hurry.

191
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,520
-Let me do it.
-I can’t stand it.

192
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,830
I feel it too.

193
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,490
Wait, I want it too.

194
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,290
You too?

195
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,390
Come on.

196
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,920
My bottom feels like vomiting.

197
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,450
-Put on your shoes.
-Hurry.

198
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,090
Hurry.

199
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,850
-I’ll go first.
-Stop arguing.

200
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,750
I'll go first.

201
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,080
-I can’t help it.
-I’m going to spit it out.

202
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,860
Be careful. There's another toilet outside.

203
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,090
Let me go first.

204
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,340
I'll go first.

205
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,100
I can't hold it anymore.

206
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,770
Thank you for today.

207
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:13,990
It's late.

208
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,100
Go back and rest.

209
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,290
I'm not going home today.

210
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,150
What do you mean

211
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,900
by that?

212
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,830
Your parents are sick.

213
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,050
You can't take care of

214
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,180
them by yourself.

215
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,740
They just have diarrhea.

216
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,300
It's not that easy to accompany the patients overnight.

217
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,590
I have a lot of experience.

218
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,500
Trust me.

219
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,560
Let's go.

220
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,460
Where are we going?

221
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,180
To buy personal cleaning supplies

222
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,380
and night-accompanying necessities.

223
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,500
Auntie, let me help you.

224
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,540
Don’t bother.

225
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,560
I'll just ask Keke to do it.

226
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,830
You have work tomorrow. Sleep more.

227
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,910
It's okay.

228
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm still awake.

229
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,870
Here.

230
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,390
-Okay.
-Be careful.

231
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,350
Thank you.

232
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,140
-Be careful.
-Thank you.

233
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,170
Thank you.

234
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,160
I'll put the IV here.

235
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,410
Okay, thank you.

236
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,960
Call me if you need anything. I'm outside.

237
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,630
Did they have diarrhea again?

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,590
There was once just now.

239
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,330
But they're much better now.

240
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,070
By the way, this Jian Fuyun's IV needs to be changed.

241
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay, I'll change it for you later.

242
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,320
So you just pretended to sleep

243
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,590
until dawn?

244
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,820
I didn't pretend to sleep all the time.

245
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,460
I just pretended for a little while

246
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,150
and fell asleep.

247
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,550
It was dawn when I woke up.

248
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,580
Jian Keke.

249
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,890
Be honest with me.

250
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,910
Do you like him

251
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,460
a little bit?

252
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,930
Who did you say I like?

253
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,710
-Who?
-Wang Haikuo!

254
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,190
Well.

255
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,360
Only children usually tend to develop

256
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,630
a dependency on someone

257
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,230
who accompanies them

258
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,060
when their parents are sick,

259
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,130
often easily developing feelings of affection.

260
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,360
At that time,

261
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,840
I didn't need any comfort.

262
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,210
I just hoped

263
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,090
someone could be with me

264
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,040
and make me feel less lonely.

265
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,340
Although you were a stranger,

266
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,830
you gave me this warmth.

267
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,550
It's not that easy to fall in love.

268
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,890
Let me tell you.

269
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,950
It only takes a moment to fall in love.

270
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,140
Sun Jiali.

271
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,200
Are you being a hopeless romantic now?

272
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,790
I'm analyzing your feelings.

273
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,790
Thank you.

274
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,920
You have

275
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,120
fallen in love with Wang Haikuo.

276
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,340
I haven't.

277
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,390
You have.

278
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,260
I haven't.

279
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,440
Haikuo.

280
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,960
Thank you so much

281
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,560
for taking care of us

282
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,110
all night.

283
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,740
No, I didn't do anything.

284
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,390
Not at all.

285
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,570
The nurse said

286
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,950
you didn't sleep at all.

287
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,200
Auntie, don't worry.

288
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,290
I actually slept.

289
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,290
Okay, I won't worry.

290
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,310
Come to my house after work.

291
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,820
I'll show you my cooking skills

292
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,640
and cook a big meal for you.

293
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,940
Really?

294
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,280
You said he didn't sleep well last night.

295
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,140
I think he should go home to sleep.

296
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,500
But I slept more last night

297
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,720
than usual.

298
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,600
No, you must be tired today.

299
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,460
You should go home and rest early.

300
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,510
But instead of resting,

301
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,480
I look forward more to Auntie Jian's cooking skills.

302
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,220
You really know the stuff.

303
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,160
That’s right.

304
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,420
Come to our house with Keke after work.

305
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,020
Thank you.

306
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,000
You're welcome.

307
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,340
Okay, that's it.

308
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,050
Jiali.

309
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,520
You'll come to my home tonight too, right?

310
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,840
But I have to work the night shift.

311
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,770
I have no choice.

312
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,990
Our home is like Jili's home.

313
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,850
She can come anytime.

314
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,980
Uncle Jian and Auntie Jian,

315
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,580
I booked a car, and it's here.

316
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,650
You even booked a car?

317
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,980
You're so sweet.

318
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,310
Well, it's my duty.

319
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,430
Let me send you to the car.

320
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,250
Okay.

321
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,700
Okay, let's go.

322
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,900
Uncle and Auntie Jian.

323
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,640
Bye.

324
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,060
Sun Jiali.

325
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,630
Here.

326
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,860
Watch your head.

327
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,090
Thank you.

328
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,220
Auntie Jian, be careful.

329
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,070
Here. Okay.

330
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,110
Uncle Jian.

331
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,490
Be careful.

332
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,520
I can't even do such small things well.

333
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,470
Am I

334
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,470
really that bad?

335
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,160
What are you doing?

336
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,260
Yuanchong, get out of my way!

337
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,210
How dare you steal my wallet?

338
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,510
Do you want to die?

339
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,500
So strong!

340
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,360
Are you okay?

341
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
I'm fine.

342
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,120
I didn't expect you to be so good.

343
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,060
But...

344
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,070
How do you know my name?

345
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,600
Yuanchong.

346
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,560
Don't you know me?

347
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,100
You are...

348
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,270
It's me.

349
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,570
Xiao Qianqian.

350
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,160
This is for you.

351
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,690
I didn't help you at all.

352
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,890
And you subdued the thief yourself.

353
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,050
I bought you this drink

354
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,920
not because you caught the thief

355
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
but to reward you

356
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,730
for acting bravely for justice.

357
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,760
In this world,

358
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,850
there aren't many people who act bravely for justice.

359
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,440
Everyone dodges when they can.

360
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,050
They only mind their own business.

361
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,490
It's rare to see a warm-hearted person

362
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,840
like you.

363
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,280
Not really.

364
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,590
There are good people who will help.

365
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,220
I'm not saying there are no good people.

366
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,630
But there are not many.

367
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,870
People all focus on themselves now.

368
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,120
They tend to be rather willful

369
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,360
in their actions.

370
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,670
See?

371
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,810
Am I right?

372
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,390
Sir.

373
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,460
Sir.

374
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,920
You left the tissues you used

375
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,470
on the ground.

376
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,020
If you still want to use it,

377
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,420
please pick it up and keep using it.

378
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,340
If you don't want to use it anymore,

379
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,420
you have to throw it into the trash can.

380
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,200
Right?

381
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,180
Stop!

382
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,600
Come back!

383
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,890
Pick up the trash.

384
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,690
Hurry up.

385
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,110
Now. Come here.

386
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,340
You're still the same.

387
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,960
You're so straightforward.

388
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,640
Isn't it good?

389
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,860
Very good.

390
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,450
Then it's fine.

391
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,690
Ready.

392
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,480
Start.

393
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
How many seconds?

394
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,930
You broke the record.

395
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,440
2.7 seconds.

396
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,290
You're amazing.

397
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,170
This is our family's money-saving game.

398
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,950
The fridge must be kept at 5 degrees.

399
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,790
It shouldn't be switched on and off frequently.

400
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,890
We have to take all the stuff we need at once

401
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,380
so that we can save money and be environmentally friendly.

402
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,340
Amazing! I've learned a trick!

403
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,480
That's not all.

404
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,600
When we brush our teeth in the morning,

405
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
our mouthwash cups have markings on them.

406
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
The water shouldn't be above a certain level.

407
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,740
This is even better!

408
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Another trick!

409
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,940
Two tricks already.

410
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,490
Shrimp, fish, and steak.

411
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,580
These high-quality ingredients

412
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,310
must have cost quite a bit, huh?

413
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,360
To treat Haikuo,

414
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,260
we need to spend some money.

415
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,460
I'm not saying I don't want to spend money.

416
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,760
But we just got discharged from the hospital.

417
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,990
Eating so much

418
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,470
is not good for our health.

419
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,800
It's not for you.

420
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,050
The two of us will eat over there.

421
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,870
There.

422
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
That's all?

423
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,290
Yes.

424
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,150
The doctor said

425
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,550
we need to eat light food these days.

426
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,230
Auntie Jian.

427
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,230
I'll feel embarrassed if you treat me like this.

428
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,020
How about this?

429
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,160
I'll eat something light with you this time.

430
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,750
When your stomach gets better,

431
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,660
I'll come and taste your cooking.

432
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,390
Do you want to come again?

433
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,700
Yes.

434
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,670
I don't let Auntie Jian down.

435
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,260
Will it be troublesome?

436
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,790
Of course.

437
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,050
-Of course...
-No trouble.

438
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,290
Of course not.

439
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,590
I welcome you to come every day.

440
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,860
Why did you ask him to come?

441
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,060
I'm asking him to come

442
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,090
and eat.

443
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:15,790
Eating and playing

444
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,490
cost money.

445
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,490
It's okay.

446
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,620
Auntie Jian, I...

447
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,070
I'll put them back into the fridge for you.

448
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,480
Thank you.

449
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,850
It's okay.

450
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,630
It's not okay.

451
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,840
Why is it not okay?

452
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,080
It will cost a lot of money.

453
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,350
-It won't.
-It will.

454
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,070
Do you want to time me?

455
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,210
Do you want to have to try?

456
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,010
-Okay.
-Okay.

457
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,560
Let's time you. Okay.

458
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,390
Come on.

459
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,900
Ready.

460
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,570
Go!

461
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,390
Darling.

462
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,580
Haikuo was so fast!

463
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,880
1.7 seconds.

464
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,090
Amazing!

465
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,860
It can be faster!

466
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,490
Do you want me to try again?

467
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,610
Okay, one more time.

468
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,380
No.

469
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,980
Save electricity.

470
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,140
No.

471
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,530
No, we need to save electricity.

472
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,860
We can't waste it.

473
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,590
Haikuo, you're amazing!

474
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,230
1.7 seconds. So fast.

475
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,360
Young man.

476
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,370
So strong.

477
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,400
You're agile.

478
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,910
Awesome!

479
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,240
Haikuo.

480
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,190
Eating such light food makes it easier to get hungry.

481
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,550
Eat more.

482
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:25,960
Okay.

483
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,920
Thank you, Auntie Jian.

484
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,850
You're welcome.

485
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,440
Why are you only having porridge?

486
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,800
Have some other dishes.

487
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,490
Thank you.

488
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,520
Haikuo.

489
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,500
You really care about Keke.

490
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,570
How tall are you?

491
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,280
181 cm.

492
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,660
Wow, so tall!

493
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,740
Okay. Okay. Okay.

494
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,840
It's not that tall.

495
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,040
You need to be at least 190 cm to be considered tall.

496
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
What's the point of being that tall?

497
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,820
His height matches Keke's

498
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,740
perfectly.

499
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,660
181 cm is too tall for Keke.

500
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,960
180 cm is the perfect height for her.

501
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,220
This one centimeter difference

502
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,860
can be ignored.

503
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,790
That's not how it works.

504
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,780
A tiny difference can lead to a huge gap.

505
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,740
You need to be very precise.

506
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,780
But Haikuo can make up for it

507
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,280
with his thoughtfulness.

508
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,760
Is he thoughtful though?

509
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,760
On the day Keke had her health checkup,

510
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,020
he hurt her...

511
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,280
Don't talk nonsense.

512
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,590
That was my mistake.

513
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,880
I can apologize for it.

514
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,620
If apologies worked,

515
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,260
we wouldn't need the police.

516
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,500
We all know each other.

517
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,480
Why bring the police into this?

518
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,250
It's because we know each other

519
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,960
that I have to be strict with him.

520
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,110
When it comes to girls,

521
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,540
you need to cherish

522
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,920
and dote on them.

523
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,770
You can't just summon

524
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,190
and dismiss them at will.

525
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,630
So what are you trying to say?

526
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,550
I'm not trying to say anything.

527
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,230
I'm teaching Haikuo

528
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,530
how to be a caring young man.

529
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,510
That's how he wins a girl's heart.

530
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,660
Your wife.

531
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,200
What about my wife?

532
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,490
I didn't say anything wrong.

533
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,550
I'm teaching him

534
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,750
how to treat girls well

535
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,350
and how...

536
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,640
Take a look.

537
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,530
Look at your wife.

538
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,350
Since you're so thoughtful and doting on women,

539
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,140
from now on, I won't clean the house,

540
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,840
cook meals,

541
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,740
or do the laundry.

542
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,040
I'll leave it all to you,

543
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,230
the loving husband and father.

544
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,890
The atmosphere was so nice,

545
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,780
but you made it so cold.

546
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Can you still eat?

547
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,850
I'm full.

548
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,290
Haikuo, here.

549
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,920
Eat more.

550
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,810
Here, eat more.

551
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,670
Otherwise, you won't be full.

552
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,320
Here.

553
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,490
Come on. Eat.

554
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,350
Deep affection often leads to lingering regret.

555
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,840
Sweet dreams are the easiest to wake from.

556
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,230
Among the myriad lights of

557
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,010
ten thousand households,

558
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,570
not a single one is for me.

559
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,290
Uncle Jian.

560
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,160
Don't think that

561
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,610
by showing me a little kindness,

562
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,950
I'll change my attitude towards you.

563
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,960
I didn't mean it that way.

564
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,060
I just don't want you to be hungry.

565
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,540
You think you can bribe me

566
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,500
with just a plate of fried rice?

567
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,360
Let me tell you,

568
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,050
our Keke is incredibly outstanding.

569
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,110
I won't easily

570
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,960
agree you to be her boyfriend.

571
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,240
I know.

572
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,380
Keke is really excellent.

573
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,670
No. No. No.

574
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,390
You have no idea.

575
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,370
Let me tell you.

576
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,450
Back then, I lent

577
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,350
all the money Keke had worked so hard to earn

578
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,100
to a good friend of mine.

579
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,740
In the end, I didn't get a single penny back.

580
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,530
Really?

581
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,160
You can't contact him?

582
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,870
What about his family?

583
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,950
He turned off his phone

584
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,270
and ran away,

585
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,290
abandoning

586
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,730
his wife and child.

587
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,260
You should at least get Keke's money back.

588
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,230
I really can't bear to pressure them to repay the debt.

589
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,790
Keke has already passed the TOEFL!

590
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,310
I don't have to go even if I pass.

591
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,830
Keke, I'm really sorry.

592
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,950
I can't get back the money I lent them.

593
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,930
Dad, why are you apologizing to me?

594
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,070
You did it to help your friend.

595
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,010
You're so kind.

596
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,490
I respect you for it.

597
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,220
Besides,

598
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,580
the bond between our family members

599
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,670
can't be measured with money.

600
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,870
So stop apologizing.

601
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,470
But you've been preparing for so long

602
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,440
and already got accepted!

603
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,830
I can just apply again later.

604
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,700
Whose daughter am I?

605
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,430
I'll definitely get accepted.

606
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,540
This is all your fault

607
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,800
for causing this mess.

608
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,970
Five million NTD!

609
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,570
How long will it take to save that much?

610
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,180
50 years!

611
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,060
I am furious.

612
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,050
It's not that serious.

613
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,570
I can earn it back.

614
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,820
My poor daughter.

615
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,930
Indeed, Keke

616
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,300
doesn't measure family bonds

617
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,710
with money.

618
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,060
That's right.

619
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,110
Keke is treasure

620
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,270
to me.

621
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,010
I'm not that shallow

622
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,660
to be swayed

623
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,700
by just a plate of fried rice.

624
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,250
Be careful.

625
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,130
You are the one who should be careful.

626
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,990
you almost dropped the fried rice

627
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,770
on the floor.

628
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,820
Be careful.

629
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,420
Sorry, my bad.

630
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,380
Uncle Jian.

631
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,220
even if you don't like me,

632
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,710
you still need to take care of your health.

633
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,100
Moreover,

634
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,080
Auntie specially prepared this for you.

635
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,370
It's low oil and healthy.

636
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,250
Alright.

637
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,970
Don't let her efforts go to waste.

638
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,040
Come on, eat it while it's hot.

639
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,280
Watch your step.

640
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,200
It's because you are forcing me to eat.

641
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,990
Yes.

642
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,580
I'm forcing you.

643
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,710
Okay, I'll do you a favor

644
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,110
this time and eat it.

645
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,910
Thank you, Uncle Jian.

646
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,570
You don't have to walk me out.

647
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,790
I'm okay on my own. Go back now.

648
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,930
I have something to tell you.

649
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,500
What is it?

650
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,110
Thank you for bringing the fried rice to my dad.

651
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,520
You saw it.

652
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,490
Actually, he's not like this

653
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,790
normally.

654
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,320
He's a nice guy,

655
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,370
recognized by everyone

656
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,170
as the most caring and responsible borough warden.

657
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,700
Normally,

658
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,090
he wouldn't be so prickly and stubborn.

659
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,690
The reason he acts this way

660
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,800
is because he loves you so much.

661
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,450
You know?

662
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,230
So you won't be mad at him, right?

663
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,710
Of course not.

664
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,330
On the contrary,

665
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,170
I like the atmosphere in your family.

666
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,540
Although

667
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,330
there's bickering and arguing,

668
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,600
you truly

669
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,990
care for each other

670
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,540
without any

671
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,740
complex ulterior motives.

672
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,240
Actually,

673
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,810
your dad's love for you

674
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,670
is quite enviable.

675
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,670
When I was in 11th grade,

676
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,510
my mom was diagnosed with cancer.

677
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,500
But because of family issues,

678
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,900
my dad didn't care about her illness at all.

679
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,180
He never visited her once.

680
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,440
Then you...

681
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,220
Nothing.

682
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,460
What did you want to say?

683
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,840
Nothing. Nothing.

684
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,410
I...

685
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,460
I just wanted to tell you

686
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,300
to be careful on your way back

687
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
and get some rest.

688
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,680
Bye.

689
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,070
I'm leaving.

690
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,360
Bye.

691
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,380
Bye.

692
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,990
Jiali, sorry for

693
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,570
keeping you after work.

694
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,030
No worries, just a few minutes.

695
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,930
But with your help recently,

696
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,910
things are easier with shift arrangements.

697
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,040
I feel like I've even

698
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,980
improved in lifting.

699
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,270
Manager.

700
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,440
Well...

701
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,820
Does Yuanchong still have enough shifts?

702
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,450
Are you trying to avoid Yuanchong?

703
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,230
No problem.

704
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,640
With my deft scheduling,

705
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,210
I guarantee you two

706
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,740
will never

707
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,510
cross paths

708
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,680
in this lifetime.

709
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,610
That's not what I meant.

710
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,970
I mean...

711
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:04,930
Yuanchong.

712
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,650
Why are you here early?

713
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,840
I wanted to have supper so I came early.

714
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,850
Jiali, I'm sorry.

715
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,420
I didn't expect this lifetime to be so short.

716
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,260
Manager.

717
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,960
What I wanted to say is,

718
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,360
I think we can just go back to normal scheduling.

719
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,560
No need to avoid each other intentionally.

720
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,020
So you're okay to be on the same shift with me?

721
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,480
Great!

722
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,449
Yes!

723
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,630
Yuanchong, is this your friend?

724
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,190
She's my junior, Qianqian.

725
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,949
Welcome.

726
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,030
Yuanchong,

727
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,420
weren't you going to have supper?

728
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,710
What's in the bag?

729
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,650
Just

730
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,969
a piece of bread.

731
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,580
Bread?

732
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,210
Is it sesame flavor

733
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,700
or chocolate?

734
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,770
Neither.

735
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,630
It's burned.

736
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,470
You're quite talented

737
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,210
to be able to burn it so evenly.

738
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,600
But I didn't want to waste food.

739
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,770
So...

740
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,270
Yuanchong, let me tell you.

741
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,400
This can no longer be considered food.

742
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,130
If it's burnt,

743
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,770
it will produce carcinogens,

744
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,100
which are very bad for your health.

745
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,300
Don't eat it.

746
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,930
I think it's still edible.

747
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,940
Yuanchong, I support you.

748
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,430
Since everyone says it's carcinogenic,

749
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,660
let's not eat it then.

750
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,160
It's not like you'll get cancer from eating it once.

751
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,080
And I know how to repay the kindness.

752
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,210
Thank you for saving me during the day.

753
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,830
Yuanchong saved you?

754
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:00,770
Yes.

755
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,830
He even got into a fight with someone.

756
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,620
Did you drink?

757
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,200
I didn't touch a drop of alcohol.

758
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,680
Why would he drink?

759
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,700
Yuanchong is always so kind.

760
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,630
It's in his nature to be righteous.

761
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,100
So,

762
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,130
Yuanchong is so nice to everyone.

763
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,700
I'll go get changed first.

764
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,750
Okay.

765
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,390
Triangle.

766
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,580
It might be a love triangle.

767
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,270
Because of the KPI,

768
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,800
work pressure has been huge.

769
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,910
Yeah.

770
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,770
Yeah, especially for us in sales,

771
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,570
the pressure is really immense.

772
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,300
Look.

773
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,050
My hair

774
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,460
has fallen out quite a bit.

775
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,360
You're right.

776
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,070
It really has.

777
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,850
So,

778
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,100
taking breaks when needed is essential.

779
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,010
You're right.

780
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,920
Then I suggest

781
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,490
we organize a networking trip

782
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,560
with the Accounting Department.

783
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,610
Sounds good.

784
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,740
You know what,

785
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,100
a new young girl recently joined

786
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,340
the PR Department.

787
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,670
She's only 23 years old.

788
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,180
How do you know that?

789
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,390
I was talking about the Accounting Department, not the PR Department.

790
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,480
Other than the PR Department,

791
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,110
we can go with the Secretarial Office.

792
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,000
I heard the girls there are

793
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,400
very pretty and elegant.

794
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,790
Yes, they're super gentle.

795
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,400
They speak clearly and logically.

796
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,290
No, but I just said...

797
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,480
The girls from the Planning Department

798
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,450
are also cute and lively.

799
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,440
They would definitely bring a lively atmosphere.

800
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,240
Yes.

801
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,570
The last time we had a stir-fry with them,

802
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,980
everyone was so high.

803
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,040
Yes. They are great.

804
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,740
We should go with them.

805
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,590
Shut up!

806
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,300
I was talking about the Accounting Department,

807
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,230
not PR,

808
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,100
not the Secretarial Office,

809
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,120
or the Planning Department.

810
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,250
It's with the Accounting Department.

811
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,210
Okay. The Accounting Department.

812
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,470
You guys go without me.

813
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,290
I still have a phone call to make.

814
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,580
I'm going to make a phone call first.

815
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,390
Bye.

816
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,580
Stop pestering Jian Keke.

817
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,580
It's not because of Jian Keke.

818
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,170
It's Elly.

819
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,530
-Elly?
-Elly?

820
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,550
Yes.

821
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,700
I found that

822
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,700
Elly despises me even more than

823
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,790
Jian Keke does.

824
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,790
I'm very surprised.

825
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,830
Does Elly dislike you?

826
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,060
Does she?

827
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,350
Yes.

828
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,170
It's very obvious.

829
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,390
Are you here alone?

830
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,350
Coffee?

831
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,920
Tea?

832
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,550
Or...

833
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,700
I'll treat you.

834
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,770
Drink mine.

835
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,340
This one.

836
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,940
-It's on me.
-This is better.

837
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,000
Oops.

838
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,150
Elly, you are here.

839
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,240
I was just looking for you.

840
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,070
Where is she?

841
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,700
She left?

842
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,160
So fast!

843
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,600
Really fast.

844
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,460
I've never seen her leave so quickly.

845
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,340
Before,

846
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,560
no matter how much Keke ignored me,

847
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,710
she never treated me like air,

848
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,160
like Elly does now.

849
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,360
It really breaks my heart.

850
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,790
Did you offend Elly?

851
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,570
No.

852
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,240
When did this situation start?

853
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,800
If I remember correctly,

854
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,920
she changed

855
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,820
when we were at your home.

856
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,610
We used to

857
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,630
follow Keke together.

858
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,460
We were once allies

859
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,980
who could

860
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,500
talk about anything,

861
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,380
inseparable.

862
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,460
If I remember correctly,

863
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,670
when I was at your place,

864
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,630
she even poured out

865
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,370
her true feelings

866
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,010
to me.

867
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,820
And I

868
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,580
And I, on that bed in your house,

869
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,340
also showed her my biggest,

870
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,290
biggest,

871
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,890
biggest

872
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
sincerity to her.

873
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,680
It's so big.

874
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,540
How come she didn't see it?

875
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,600
That is indeed a bit serious.

876
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,920
Okay.

877
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,710
I've decided.

878
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,410
I support you.

879
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,400
I'll join this networking event with the Accounting Department.

880
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,120
Me too.

881
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,030
I'll help you find the answer.

882
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,540
Here.

883
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,390
You guys are so nice to me.

884
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,900
You should wipe your tears.

885
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,530
No.

886
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,100
I can't use tissues.

887
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,610
These tissues

888
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,530
are too rough.

889
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,170
They'll scratch my skin.

890
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,710
My eyeliners!

891
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,490
So ugly.

892
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,380
I should have used the waterproof kind.

893
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,020
[Trendee] [Accounting Department]

894
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,020
So food and accommodation

895
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,050
are all free.

896
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,440
We only need to pay for transportation.

897
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,340
No need.

898
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,490
Chen Shi said,

899
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
depending on the number of people,

900
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,650
the client will provide a minivan or van.

901
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,110
Isn't that

902
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,860
totally free?

903
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,610
It's free.

904
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,960
It's a trip that doesn't cost a penny.

905
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,470
That's too good to be true.

906
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,450
But Haikuo is in the Business Department.

907
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,410
He might attend it.

908
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,990
But it's free.

909
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,610
[Free]

910
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,800
I really want to go.

911
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,600
Is there a need to hesitate so much?

912
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,160
Mr. Wang.

913
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,870
I was just thinking about him and he appeared.

914
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,080
This time it's really completely free.

915
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,600
Right?

916
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,200
Yes.

917
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,840
It's totally free.

918
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,700
So I hope

919
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,870
everyone from the Accounting Department

920
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,930
can participate

921
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,750
and have a pleasant holiday.

922
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,230
Why is he here?

923
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,850
He's not going to ask me if I want to join, right?

924
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,310
How should I answer?

925
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,900
Yes

926
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:06,790
or no?

927
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,470
Elly,

928
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,550
are you willing to join?

929
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,190
You...

930
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,060
Are you asking me?

931
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,260
[Preview]

932
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,080
Is he influenced by Michael Zhao

933
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,680
or possessed?

934
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,450
Yuanchong, why are you so cute?

935
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,330
Two-timing.

936
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,170
You're asking the right person.

937
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,930
Haikuo.

938
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:42,710
What? What Haikuo?

939
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,610
There's a legend about this forest.

940
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,530
After walking around it,

941
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,390
you can find your own happiness.

942
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,320
I think I've really fallen for Wang Haikuo.
