[Love on a Shoestring]

3
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,140
Should we set up the venue quickly?

[Episode 14]

5
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,630
Your boyfriend is coming.

6
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,480
He is not my boyfriend yet.

7
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,230
He will be your boyfriend after your confession.

8
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,230
Not necessarily.

9
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,560
Maybe he won't agree.

10
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,240
Time is running out.

11
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,580
Let's go through the process first.

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,420
Jiali.

13
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,250
Please go over there

14
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,759
and turn off

15
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,390
all the lights.

16
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,350
-Okay, no problem.
-Here.

17
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,479
All of them.

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,460
Turn them off later.

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,759
-Okay.
-Then, Yuanchong...

20
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,770
You will hide in here.

21
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,410
When Haikuo

22
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,120
comes out from here,

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,789
close the door.

24
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,650
Close the door.

25
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
And then,

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,250
it will be dark here.

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,520
The heart-shaped arrangement of candles behind me will light up.

28
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,870
Why is it decorated like this?

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,060
Because today is an important day.

30
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,950
I remember what I want to tell you.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,220
What do you want to tell me?

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,370
Wang Haikuo.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,360
To me,

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,550
you're like the temperate oceanic climate.

35
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,220
You've always been warm.

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,290
Ever since I met you,

37
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,350
my life has become colorful and rich.

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,630
I like you.

39
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,370
Wait.

40
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,180
What if he says no?

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,290
You can't just think about the good side.

42
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,150
There are always accidents.

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
How is that possible?

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,290
Haikuo liked Keke.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,450
Everything will go well today, okay?

46
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,060
But...

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,390
Keke refused

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,500
Haikuo many times.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,590
Will he be angry?

50
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,820
Li Yuanchong.

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,570
You...

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,630
Say it again.

53
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,010
I mean

54
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,560
you two have fallen in love.

55
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,900
Now all that's left is

56
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,870
the confession.

57
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,620
We should set up the candles

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
and wait for the male lead to arrive.

59
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,430
I'll go set up the candles.

60
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,370
Idiot!

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,740
One more.

62
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,440
Two more.

63
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,170
It's weird.

64
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,160
What's weird?

65
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,070
Something is wrong.

66
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,620
How could there be anything wrong?

67
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,320
That's how the video shows.

68
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,050
It's so weird.

69
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,269
Can you make it clear in one go?

70
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,230
I'm talking about Keke.

71
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,290
She must be planning something.

72
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,280
So she didn't want me to go with her.

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,770
She also asked Haikuo

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,410
to arrive later.

75
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,640
Do you think there's a problem?

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,530
She asked Haikuo to arrive later?

77
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,659
It feels

78
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,909
a bit off.

79
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,620
Right?

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,280
Could it be...

81
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,570
She wants to confess her love?

82
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,580
No way.

83
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,870
-What confession?
-Why not?

84
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,120
If Keke wants to confess her love,

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,970
they should

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,490
be

87
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,460
loving each other now.

88
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,090
Impossible.

89
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,660
How can Keke confess her love?

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Keke

91
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,830
is not that worthless.

92
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,210
You're so annoying.

93
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,970
What era is it now?

94
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,880
Keke

95
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,060
is my baby!

96
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,410
How could she be the one

97
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,950
doing the chasing?

98
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,190
What's wrong with a girl confessing first?

99
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,260
If she loves him, she should say it.

100
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,940
How would he know if she doesn't say it?

101
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,130
What do you mean by doing the chasing?

102
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,909
Chasing what?

103
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,110
Chasing the chicken?

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,860
Hello?

105
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,380
I'm going now.

106
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:51,990
Okay.

107
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,090
See you later. Bye.

108
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,430
Okay.

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,210
Okay, bye.

110
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,250
Haikuo said he had left.

111
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,909
Hurry up.

112
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,200
Don't be nervous.

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,670
The candles have been arranged in a heart shape.

114
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,730
And I used proportional calculations.

115
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,940
It's perfect.

116
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,790
It will go well later.

117
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,890
Okay, thank you.

118
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,200
Take a deep breath.

119
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,100
Is he here?

120
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,010
So soon?

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
Hide now.

122
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,940
Okay.

123
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,440
-I’ll go to the door.
-Turn off the lights.

124
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,990
Honey.

125
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,210
Honey, what's wrong?

126
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,980
Come on.

127
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,490
-Why did you close the door?
-Uncle Jian.

128
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,720
I was behind you.

129
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,730
Why were you following me so closely?

130
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,990
-Are you okay?
-My nose is going to break.

131
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,990
It's bleeding.

132
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,840
Right.

133
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,100
Are you okay?

134
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,030
It hurts.

135
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,010
Why are you here?

136
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,910
Got you.

137
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,520
I knew it.

138
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,010
You want to

139
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,760
confess your love, right?

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,790
Keke.

141
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,540
Think twice before you act.

142
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,010
Don't be reckless.

143
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,630
You should think it through.

144
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,960
It should be Haikuo.

145
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,620
Hide!

146
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,190
Hide!

147
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,920
-Hide?
-Hide inside.

148
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,490
Where?

149
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,690
To the right.

150
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,420
To the right.

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,590
To the right.

152
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,110
Close the door.

153
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,090
It hurts!

154
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,040
Stop!

155
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,670
Turn on the lights.

156
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,860
-What now?
-Turn on the lights.

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,360
-Who is it?
-Turn on the lights.

158
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,290
Stop!

159
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,530
Stop! It's me!

160
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,660
Stop! It's me!

161
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,490
Stop!

162
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,420
Stop!

163
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,070
Yuanchong.

164
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,430
Why are you here?

165
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,140
Qianqian, why are you here?

166
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,690
Well.

167
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,760
I know Yuanchong is learning baking from you.

168
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,230
I'm here to see...

169
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
Your eyes are swollen.

170
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,820
It needs an ice compress.

171
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Go get some ice.

172
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,190
Yes, I'll get it.

173
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,289
I want some too.

174
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,679
Let me help you.

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,490
You hit too hard.

176
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,620
What are you doing?

177
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,770
I have to confess to Haikuo later.

178
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,070
You want to confess to me?

179
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,980
I...

180
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,770
You didn't reply to my message.

181
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,040
When I arrived,

182
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,450
the door was open, so...

183
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,360
The door was open.

184
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,410
It was me.

185
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,770
I didn't close the door.

186
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,700
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,850
No, it was me.

188
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,330
I hit him.

189
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,150
That's why he couldn't close the door.

190
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,660
-It was me.
-No.

191
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,350
Not you two.

192
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,520
It's me and Uncle Jian...

193
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,270
Well...

194
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,600
We wanted to peep.

195
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,360
The door was closed when we arrived.

196
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,150
It's our problem.

197
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,800
Not you.

198
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,580
Good kids.

199
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,450
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,700
Did I come in at the wrong time?

201
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
Now I...

202
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,790
Let's do it again.

203
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,350
Okay, I was standing by the door.

204
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,050
Okay, I was standing here.

205
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,810
I was going to...

206
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,530
My movement just now...

207
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,320
Yes.

208
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,720
Yes, this move.

209
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,780
No need!

210
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,740
I'm leaving.

211
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,770
Keke.

212
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,990
Stop!

213
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,220
-What are you doing?
-Keke!

214
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,950
Keke!

215
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,890
Keke, wait.

216
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,370
Keke!

217
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,620
Why are you running away?

218
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,580
No one confesses their love in front of their parents.

219
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,420
Then...

220
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,200
Is this place alright?

221
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,290
Wang Haikuo,

222
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,050
you're like the temperate oceanic climate.

223
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,020
To me,

224
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,360
you have always been warm.

225
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,160
Ever since I met you,

226
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,060
I think my life

227
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,250
has become colorful and rich.

228
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
Even though our values are different,

229
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,730
extremely different,

230
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,830
I believe we can overcome this.

231
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,190
I really like you.

232
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,320
You saying you like me

233
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,260
is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.

234
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,820
But I

235
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,290
didn't expect

236
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,570
you to confess to me,

237
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,020
and I didn't expect you to believe

238
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,450
that I really like you.

239
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,090
Would you be the one and only

240
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,220
to be with me in a buy-one-get-one-free deal?

241
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,790
How long did it take you

242
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,120
to memorize that line?

243
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,490
Three days.

244
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,100
Three days?

245
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,840
I do.

246
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,150
Cut!

247
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,610
Action!

248
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,530
Cut!

249
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,900
Action!

250
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,190
What action?

251
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:37,830
You...

252
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,270
You two, please.

253
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,990
This is a public place.

254
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,470
It won't be proper

255
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,450
for people to see it.

256
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,480
How?

257
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,000
Come on.

258
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,320
This is a very important kiss of commitment.

259
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,050
Why did you suddenly come out?

260
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,310
Why are you two here again?

261
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,960
It's not just us.

262
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,930
Come out!

263
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,620
We're here too.

264
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,040
Keke.

265
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,690
So sweet.

266
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,800
The only thing missing is a kiss of commitment.

267
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,810
That's right.

268
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,060
It's all your fault, Borough Warden.

269
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,590
You're so nosy.

270
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,060
Do you live by the beach?

271
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,490
Do you understand or not?

272
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,190
This is a park.

273
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,140
Many kids are here.

274
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,540
If they see them like this,

275
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,070
and they will go back and kiss each other, is it proper?

276
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,660
It's okay.

277
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,150
You two can shut the door of your room

278
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,250
and do whatever you want.

279
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,290
Yes.

280
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,470
Shut up!

281
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,650
Louis

282
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,220
comes from a scholar family.

283
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,390
His family upbringing is strict.

284
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,520
He is gentle.

285
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,220
He's also modest and polite when he talks,

286
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,930
and never quarrels with anyone.

287
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,660
I have a question for you too.

288
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,510
Go ahead.

289
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,410
Do you listen to your dad

290
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,820
or your mom?

291
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,110
I listen to Dad in odd-numbered months

292
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,190
and Mom in even-numbered months.

293
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,380
And my dad would wake me up.

294
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,730
Mom will prepare lunch for me.

295
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,870
But if I have to...

296
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,180
Terry.

297
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,520
Although he's not a rich second generation,

298
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,880
he started his own business.

299
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,690
The company earns at least tens of millions every year.

300
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,710
You are so busy at work,

301
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,910
yet you still have a good figure.

302
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,910
Amazing!

303
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,300
I love sports,

304
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,810
like basketball and tennis.

305
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,010
They are good sports to relieve stress.

306
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,290
I think boys who work out

307
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,490
are attractive.

308
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,390
But

309
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,110
there are some crow's feet on your eyetail.

310
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,160
Really?

311
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,690
Paul.

312
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,140
A Harvard graduate.

313
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,660
He's good at ten languages.

314
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,860
Not only can he write programs,

315
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,780
but also good at art and music.

316
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,260
I didn't expect you to know a lot.

317
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,480
Well.

318
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,730
I just like

319
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,180
to learn new things.

320
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,360
Let me ask you.

321
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,240
What's the difference between

322
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,460
anti-aging retinol and retinoic acid?

323
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,780
Is there anything on the previous three guys

324
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,900
that doesn't meet your criteria?

325
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,360
Louis is not confident or independent.

326
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,590
Terry is not maintaining himself.

327
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,290
In a few years, he will look ugly.

328
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,980
Paul

329
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,990
has nothing in common with me.

330
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,030
We can't talk.

331
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,180
Not confident or independent.

332
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,849
Doesn't know how to maintain himself.

333
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,589
Has nothing in common with you.

334
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,960
Why do you keep looking at me?

335
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,760
It means you have a crush on someone.

336
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,060
You are comparing the three of them with him.

337
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm not.

338
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,050
You think too much.

339
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,760
He needs to be confident and independent,

340
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,250
good at maintenance

341
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,980
and has common topics with you.

342
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,880
I only know one guy of this kind.

343
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,830
He's from our Business Department.

344
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,970
Stop.

345
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,920
-Stop.
-Zhao...

346
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,050
Don't mention his name.

347
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,700
A table for two.

348
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,500
Michael Zhao?

349
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,730
Am I hallucinating?

350
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,840
Or am I seeing things wrong?

351
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
What's wrong?

352
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,430
Nothing.

353
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,690
No, my...

354
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,570
My eyes are a little blurred.

355
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,360
You know who I'm talking about anyway.

356
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,910
So that's why you would consider him as a benchmark for blind dates.

357
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,950
I didn't.

358
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,020
A man who deserves me

359
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,960
must be independent, and confident,

360
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,990
know how to take care of himself,

361
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,010
and share common topics with me.

362
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,870
These are the basics, okay?

363
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,130
Cousin,

364
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,900
you can't lie about love.

365
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,130
You have to face it if you encounter it.

366
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,990
Don't avoid it.

367
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,760
If you do, you'll get nothing.

368
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,950
I'm not avoiding it.

369
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,960
It's the people you introduced to me are not good enough.

370
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,450
I haven't blamed you for introducing the wrong people to me.

371
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,710
You pay for the drinks.

372
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,110
What should I do?

373
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,380
Am I that obvious?

374
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,380
Even my cousin can see shades of Michael Zhao

375
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,980
in my criteria for a partner.

376
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,350
You sleep with your eyes open.

377
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,280
How should I put it?

378
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,770
It's a little cute.

379
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,640
No.

380
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,430
I can't fall deeper and deeper.

381
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,460
I need to find a different man

382
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,940
to distract my attention.

383
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,860
Please.

384
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,670
Please give me a man who fits the criteria.

385
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,160
Please.

386
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,740
Please.

387
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,780
Elly.

388
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,830
Long time no see.

389
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,760
Can God be so efficient?

390
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,320
Have you forgotten who I am?

391
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,680
No.

392
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,430
You are...

393
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,350
Eric.

394
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,010
Yes.

395
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,870
You haven't contacted me

396
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,430
since we went to the club last time.

397
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,260
I was wondering

398
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
how I upset you.

399
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,790
No way.

400
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,690
I'm happy to see you now.

401
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:22,910
You...

402
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,220
Are you free now?

403
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,480
Of course.

404
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,710
Well,

405
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,070
do I have the honor to invite you to dinner?

406
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,770
Sure.

407
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,760
Let's go.

408
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,360
Sis. What's wrong?

409
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,260
Why is your expression so unpleasant when you see me?

410
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,360
It's not about you.

411
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,150
I saw a scumbag

412
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,690
lying to another girl.

413
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,160
Who?

414
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,540
Who would even say

415
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,710
they want to tour someone else's room?

416
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,680
I'm not touring someone else's room.

417
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,910
I'm touring my girlfriend's room.

418
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,260
Then suit yourself.

419
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,490
Well,

420
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,460
before touring,

421
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,000
I have a question for you.

422
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,080
What is it? Go ahead.

423
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,480
When did you fall in love with me?

424
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,090
I don't remember.

425
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,430
You really don't remember?

426
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,680
I really don't.

427
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,430
I'm not very smart. I can't remember.

428
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
I can't remember.

429
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,250
This question seems too difficult.

430
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,970
Is it difficult?

431
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,430
This is a difficult question.

432
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,760
It's really difficult.

433
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,720
Okay, then

434
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,060
take your time to think about it.

435
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,190
For the days to come, I'll be here to...

436
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,110
To do what?

437
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
To see your childhood photos.

438
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,700
No.

439
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,010
No.

440
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,160
Why not?

441
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,730
No means no.

442
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,860
No.

443
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,370
You can't.

444
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,900
Do you have a secret?

445
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,830
I don't.

446
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,230
Yes, you do.

447
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,070
No, I don't have any secrets.

448
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,780
You don't?

449
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,680
No.

450
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,010
Really?

451
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,120
Really.

452
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,470
Are you sure?

453
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,710
You want to see Keke's photos?

454
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
They're all here.

455
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,840
Dad, why didn't you knock?

456
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
The door was open.

457
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,920
Come on.

458
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,360
You want to know

459
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,140
the whole growth process of Keke.

460
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,220
If you need anything,

461
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,080
just ask me.

462
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,200
I know her best.

463
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,030
I brought her up.

464
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,330
Come take a look.

465
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,460
Isn't this nice?

466
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,850
This is the first time

467
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,080
I took Keke to the zoo.

468
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,790
I took her here.

469
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,250
This is the first time

470
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,960
I took Keke to kindergarten.

471
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,580
I took her there.

472
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,340
This is interesting.

473
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,330
I was the first one

474
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,830
to bathe Keke too.

475
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
Dad.

476
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,840
How can you show such things

477
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,100
to others so casually?

478
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,570
Well, he wanted to see the photos.

479
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,800
Well,

480
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,480
I haven't fed the fish today.

481
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,680
Haikuo, come with me to feed the fish.

482
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,830
Yes, let's feed the fish.

483
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,940
Dad, we're going to feed the fish.

484
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,340
Uncle Jian, I'm going to feed the fish.

485
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,720
[Taiwan Taxi]

486
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,450
Thank you.

487
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,420
I can send you home directly.

488
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,960
No need. I live too far away.

489
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,890
Taking the subway will be faster.

490
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,480
Okay then.

491
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,190
There will be many more chances

492
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,850
to take you home in the future.

493
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Let's meet again.

494
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,130
-Bye.
-Bye.

495
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,660
What's wrong with me?

496
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,950
I didn't even want Eric to take me home.

497
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,630
I should have said yes.

498
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,360
Breakfast is very important.

499
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
It's the start of a whole day.

500
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,910
If you eat too hastily,

501
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,800
that's not elegant at all.

502
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,890
You're sweating.

503
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,900
I can

504
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,300
make you cool down

505
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,010
immediately.

506
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,800
What's so funny about sleeping with your eyes open?

507
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,820
As long as you're comfortable and can sleep,

508
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,020
it doesn't matter if your eyes are open.

509
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,390
Have your own thoughts.

510
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,990
Don't be confined by societal norms.

511
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,130
Elly.

512
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,320
Wake up.

513
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,690
This is just friendship between colleagues.

514
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,940
It can't be love.

515
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,890
Granny,

516
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
how much is all this? I'll buy it all.

517
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,410
Can you eat so much by yourself?

518
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,490
I can.

519
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,710
You can go home after selling it.

520
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,730
Alright, thank you.

521
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,770
Here.

522
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,800
Let me pack this.

523
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,540
Okay.

524
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,710
This big bag.

525
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Gosh.

526
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,200
I want to avoid him. But now I ran into him.

527
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,490
No, no, no.

528
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:26,880
You...

529
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,130
You can't fall for him

530
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,460
just because he's kind.

531
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,620
So annoying!

532
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,760
It's nothing.

533
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,970
Don't work too hard.

534
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,120
Elly.

535
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,190
Why are you here?

536
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,880
Why are you doing this to me?

537
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
What did I do?

538
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,600
You thief!

539
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,530
Thief?

540
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,830
You mean the vegetables?

541
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,210
I didn't steal them. I paid for them.

542
00:26:59,210 --> 00:26:59,950
You did.

543
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,190
You definitely stole!

544
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,690
I...

545
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,410
You stole!

546
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,610
I really paid.

547
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,300
You stole...

548
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,080
-I really didn't.
-You stole my...

549
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,800
My...

550
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,230
You stole my...

551
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,650
You mean the vegetables?

552
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,320
Don't do this to me!

553
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,110
You don't want cauliflower?

554
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,880
I have bok choy too.

555
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,020
You can take this.

556
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,880
Cheers.

557
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,630
Cheers.

558
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,860
Smile.

559
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,360
Smile.

560
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,130
Let's eat.

561
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,550
Let's eat.

562
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,110
Let's eat.

563
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,650
Let's eat.

564
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,290
Haikuo, do you know that

565
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,230
when Keke first started liking you,

566
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,630
she had a lot of concerns?

567
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,300
About what?

568
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,080
Just worried that

569
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,960
their values might be different.

570
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,040
And now you're not worried?

571
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,100
I thought

572
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,000
we'd try to communicate.

573
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,630
It should be fine, right?

574
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,420
No problem.

575
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,030
I think

576
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,280
having aligned values is important.

577
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,570
Especially now,

578
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,970
financial management has become crucial.

579
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,040
We need to create passive income

580
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,500
and invest wisely.

581
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,500
I bought an investment insurance policy

582
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,280
as a form of savings.

583
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,010
Is that okay?

584
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,270
That's great.

585
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,340
Great.

586
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,860
Haikuo, what about you?

587
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,240
I don't have any

588
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,320
financial investments.

589
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,720
I only have health and accident insurance.

590
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,590
I have

591
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,780
regular stock investments and savings.

592
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,480
Now it's not just about saving money,

593
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,540
but also about knowing how to invest.

594
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,760
I will learn from you

595
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
how to save money.

596
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,400
Start saving money from now on?

597
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,200
Well,

598
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,250
didn't you save money before?

599
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,290
No.

600
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,340
How many digits do you have

601
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,570
in your bank account?

602
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,920
I just got paid,

603
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,450
so it's around 400,000 NTD.

604
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,500
That's a lot.

605
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,830
It's good for young people to save money

606
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,980
nowadays.

607
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,190
But I'm curious.

608
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,960
In your company,

609
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,510
what's the monthly salary for a salesperson?

610
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
It depends on your performance and position.

611
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,240
For me, it's around 400,000.

612
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,480
400,000?

613
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,610
It's the beginning of the month,

614
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,850
and you have 400,000.

615
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,600
How much do you have

616
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,240
by the end of the month?

617
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,360
Usually,

618
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,160
just double digits.

619
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,360
But at the beginning of the month, it goes back to 400,000.

620
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,330
So you're living paycheck to paycheck?

621
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,790
But I'll learn how to

622
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,590
manage money

623
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,990
and save from everyone.

624
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:10,880
Great.

625
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,010
I believe with Keke's help,

626
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,740
your lifestyle will change very quickly.

627
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,020
Come on.

628
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,150
Let's eat.

629
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,260
Eat.

630
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,230
Which kind of flower do you like?

631
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,620
I prefer money to flowers.

632
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,730
Don't waste money on this.

633
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,660
Makes sense. Got it.

634
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,840
Keke.

635
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,130
I'm sorry.

636
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,420
I can't

637
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,030
give you a wedding.

638
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,740
I can't even afford a decent ring.

639
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,860
Take a deep breath.

640
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,030
Exhale.

641
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,450
Relax.

642
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,470
Come on.

643
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,430
Keke, I'm sorry.

644
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,700
I don't have money for painless labor.

645
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,520
I promise

646
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,500
to make it up next time.

647
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,590
Next time, for sure.

648
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,190
Next time?

649
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,790
-Next time.
-No.

650
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,580
Hang in there.

651
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,120
Please give us more time.

652
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,090
I'll pay the rent in full

653
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,170
next time.

654
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,590
But you already owe me

655
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,870
three months' rent.

656
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,610
If you don't have something

657
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,690
to offer as collateral,

658
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,350
you'll have to move out today.

659
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,830
Landlady, I'm sorry.

660
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,160
Is this enough?

661
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,950
Alright, this time, you can use the gold as collateral.

662
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,580
But next time, pay the rent on time.

663
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,360
Thank you.

664
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,470
Thank you.

665
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,500
Honey, I'm sorry.

666
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,530
I can't believe I made you give up your dowry.

667
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,210
I'm such a loser.

668
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,760
It's okay.

669
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,880
Please trust me.

670
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,350
I'll work hard

671
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,870
to get your dowry back.

672
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
-Okay?
-Okay.

673
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,390
Keke.

674
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,560
I'm sorry.

675
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,550
I didn't give you happiness in this life.

676
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,780
I'll make it up next time.

677
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,100
Next time, for sure.

678
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:11,929
Haikuo!

679
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,010
Haikuo!

680
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,469
Next time...

681
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,800
Honey.

682
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,760
Have you heard anything?

683
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,800
Honey.

684
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,780
Have you heard\

685
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,110
someone crying?

686
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,739
Honey!

687
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,570
Honey!

688
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,989
It's me.

689
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:50,219
What's wrong?

690
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
Why are you crying?

691
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,090
Did you have a nightmare?

692
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,850
Yes.

693
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,160
I dreamed of Keke.

694
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,890
Her life was miserable,

695
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,330
very pitiful and tragic.

696
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,090
What did you

697
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,930
dream about?

698
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,120
They had no money.

699
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,410
I know what you're worried about.

700
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,600
Haikuo doesn't have any savings now,

701
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,790
which makes me uneasy too.

702
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,870
But he said

703
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,470
he would learn from Keke

704
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,240
and start to save money.

705
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,590
Is there still time?

706
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,750
With Haikuo's earning ability,

707
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,240
as long as he can save money,

708
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,930
there won't be a problem.

709
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,220
And Keke is so good with money.

710
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,820
You are so meticulous.

711
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,290
She will definitely save the money Haikuo makes

712
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,420
as much as possible.

713
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,880
You're right.

714
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,380
Keke

715
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,640
is very frugal.

716
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,480
She rarely spends money

717
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,330
unnecessarily.

718
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,820
So,

719
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,160
you don't have to worry.

720
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,390
Moreover,

721
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,530
they just started dating.

722
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,320
We can still observe them for a while.

723
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,840
Yes, we need to observe carefully.

724
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,320
Okay, sleep now.

725
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,650
Stop thinking about it.

726
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,340
Here.

727
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,160
I might have trouble sleeping.

728
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,320
Comfort me.

729
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,830
Okay.

730
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,520
Okay, go to sleep.

731
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,920
It's like comforting a child.

732
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,150
How old are you?

733
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,260
Come, let's sleep.

734
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,790
There.

735
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,720
There.

736
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,310
Are you okay?

737
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,740
Sorry, I'm so clumsy.

738
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,620
I burnt myself.

739
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,110
Go run cold water over it.

740
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,720
I'll get some ice.

741
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,960
Yuanchong.

742
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,630
I know you work very hard.

743
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,070
But I don't want you to force yourself

744
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,030
to do something you're not good at,

745
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
even getting hurt.

746
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,760
But I want to help you.

747
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,460
This is my dream.

748
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,380
I should achieve it myself.

749
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,480
You should pursue your own dreams,

750
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,680
not mine.

751
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,140
But

752
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,130
before I find

753
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,450
my dream...

754
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,110
-Let me tell you.
-I'm willing to...

755
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,530
I didn't stop you

756
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,080
from learning baking

757
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,120
initially because I thought

758
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,830
if you could find

759
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,690
joy or a sense of

760
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,960
accomplishment in it,

761
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,620
that would be most important.

762
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,460
But I found that

763
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,960
you didn't get any positive energy from it.

764
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,820
But if I succeed,

765
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,150
I would be twice as happy.

766
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,260
But the truth is

767
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,260
you're really not suited for it.

768
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,760
I appreciate you

769
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,090
treating my dream

770
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,790
as your own,

771
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,820
and I can feel your care,

772
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,470
but I have to tell you honestly,

773
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,780
your persistence

774
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
has become a kind of pressure for me.

775
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,660
So,

776
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,450
I'm putting you under pressure.

777
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,270
Yes.

778
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,080
You're parasitizing on my dream.

779
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,570
Not only are you unhappy,

780
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,970
I'm also not happy.

781
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,600
I need to take this call.

782
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,470
Yuanchong.

783
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,690
What happened to you?

784
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,400
Am I useless

785
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,250
without a dream?

786
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,940
What do you mean?

787
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,610
Jiali said I'm parasitizing on her dream,

788
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,410
making her feel pressured.

789
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,190
So,

790
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,600
she wants me to find my own dream.

791
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,330
And then?

792
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,610
Then,

793
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,550
I looked up the definition of a dream.

794
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,060
It's a person's

795
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,510
goal and desire for the future.

796
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,100
People with dreams

797
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,050
are often more motivated and focused

798
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,750
than those without dreams.

799
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,450
No wonder I feel lost every day.

800
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,870
Yuanchong.

801
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,250
We are still college students.

802
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,020
We are still young.

803
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,630
Think about it.

804
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,600
The path to the future is still long.

805
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,870
We can find our dreams as we go.

806
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,860
I know you're comforting me.

807
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,960
But people my age in their senior year

808
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,540
are already job hunting.

809
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,130
I don't even know

810
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,590
what my future job will be.

811
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,630
I think

812
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,760
I've lost my direction.

813
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,510
Should I have been more tactful?

814
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,970
It has nothing to do with being tactful.

815
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,450
If it's really not working, don't force it.

816
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,360
Sun Jiali!

817
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,340
Who gave you the right to make decisions for Yuanchong?

818
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,630
What's wrong?

819
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,960
Why are you so agitated?

820
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,500
Yuanchong's life

821
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,900
should be decided by him.

822
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,010
Who are you to judge his choices?

823
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,610
I just think

824
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,320
he's not suited for baking.

825
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,040
Whether he's suited or not, and whether to give up or not,

826
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,490
that's up to him,

827
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,700
Instead of you

828
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,390
telling him that his choice was wrong.

829
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,520
I just think

830
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,140
he should work for himself,

831
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,260
not for me.

832
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,030
Right.

833
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,100
Jiali is doing this for Yuanchong.

834
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,630
She's doing it for his sake.

835
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,870
I hate hearing

836
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,620
"it's for your own good."

837
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,940
Are you Yuanchong?

838
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,620
How do you know

839
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,750
what is good for him?

840
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,170
Have you seen his future?

841
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,130
Besides,

842
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,880
why does he have to live for himself?

843
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,430
Why can't he live for others?

844
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,040
Why must he have a dream?

845
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,840
Is it wrong not to have a dream?

846
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,090
In the end,

847
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,330
you are just selfish.

848
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,880
You're afraid of feeling guilty,

849
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,220
so you said he's

850
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,860
parasitizing on your dream.

851
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,610
Looks like

852
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,050
I hit the nail on the head.

853
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,670
You have nothing to say now.

854
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,620
Since you're so afraid of others

855
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,220
parasitizing on your dream,

856
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,810
Yuanchong and I

857
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,780
won't participate in the charity sale next week.

858
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,420
He's successfully transferred money again this time.

859
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,100
Didn't I tell you

860
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,520
not to accept his transfers anymore?

861
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,640
The old account

862
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
was already canceled.

863
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,650
It's a new account.

864
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,180
I don't know how he found it.

865
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,710
Your job is to

866
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,980
change my account every month.

867
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,930
You can't even handle this small task?

868
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,410
I'm sorry.

869
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,050
President Wang.

870
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:51,880
Next month...

871
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,070
There's no next month.

872
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,080
You're fired.

873
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:54,630
President Wang,

874
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,590
I've worked here for over twenty years.

875
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,350
-Security.
-I've worked so hard for this company.

876
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,590
You can't fire me, President Wang.

877
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,430
Get out!

878
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,310
Please.

879
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,240
President Wang,

880
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,370
here's the information you asked for.

881
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,710
He's currently a sales manager

882
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,970
at a small to medium-sized company,

883
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:19,830
leading a team.

884
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,370
What future can he have in such a small company?

885
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,650
How can he stand it?

886
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,110
Have you taken care of

887
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,050
what I asked?

888
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,000
It's all arranged.

889
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,650
You can meet him anytime.

890
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,250
I won't let you go.

891
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,370
[Haikuo's father] [Wang Changfa] [Will stop at nothing to achieve his goals]

892
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,690
[Preview]

893
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,800
Are you getting married?

894
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Keke, I want to

895
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,970
make a pact with you.

896
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,330
I'm here to invite everyone

897
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,620
to my engagement party.

898
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,520
It's probably your heart racing

899
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,320
that's making you sweat so much.

900
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,140
Mr. Wang, what's the matter?

901
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,910
Mr. Wang?

902
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,320
How can there be someone

903
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,450
more narcissistic than Michael Zhao?

904
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,690
This guy looks familiar.

905
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,410
Elly!

906
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,790
You want to drive a wedge between me and Eric

907
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,150
with rumors?

908
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,310
What do you want?

909
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,390
Why do you react so strongly

910
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,360
to things about Elly?
