00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,850
Why are you so late?

191
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,780
[Trendee; Accounting Department]

192
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,590
Keke.

193
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,510
Does Haikuo have a girlfriend?

194
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,260
How do I know if he has a girlfriend?

195
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,150
Haven't you known Haikuo for many years?

196
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,150
You must be close.

197
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,580
Maybe or maybe not.

198
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,390
Maybe or maybe not?

199
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,280
Is there or not?

200
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,860
He's in good condition.

201
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,090
So he might have a girlfriend.

202
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,020
But he didn't tell me.

203
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,350
So he probably doesn't have a girlfriend.

204
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,280
Then there must be someone Haikuo likes.

205
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,140
I heard he likes someone.

206
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,000
I heard that the person he likes

207
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,980
is in our department.

208
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,940
Is it you?

209
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Is it me?

210
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,600
Excuse me.

211
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,400
What are you doing here?

212
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,010
Didn't we agree to have lunch together yesterday?

213
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,690
But something came up and I suddenly left.

214
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,560
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,200
So I bought you some milk.

216
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,590
Their intense gaze

217
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,070
is just too glaring.

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,230
It's okay.

219
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,740
I said it was my treat yesterday.

220
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,070
And I didn't even get to.

221
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,710
But I was the one who broke the appointment.

222
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,790
What kind of logic is that?

223
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,320
I won't accept any reward for no contribution.

224
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,790
I can't take advantage of you.

225
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,900
Take it back.

226
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,650
Since Keke doesn't want it,

227
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,140
how about giving it to me?

228
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,060
I love taking advantage of others.

229
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,010
Because it makes me feel happy.

230
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,490
Wait.

231
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,400
I'll take this bottle of milk.

232
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,840
Why did you break your promise?

233
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,880
Didn't you say you won't take advantage of him?

234
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,730
I'm not taking advantage of him.

235
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,380
I'm buying it.

236
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,280
Here.

237
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,960
Take it.

238
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,510
I think I'm watching a palace drama.

239
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,480
It was a twist and turn.

240
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,720
Their expressions were so shocking.

241
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,290
You're exaggerating.

242
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,620
Not at all.

243
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,980
Manager, didn't you see that?

244
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,810
Keke and Elly's expressions were so dramatic.

245
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,560
But Manager,

246
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,790
why are you so nice to Keke?

247
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,910
Because I think

248
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,910
she is an interesting girl.

249
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,010
Interesting?

250
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,300
No.

251
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,340
When you want to reimburse the business fee,

252
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,130
you won't think

253
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,950
she's interesting at all.

254
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,240
What do you want?

255
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,090
Can't you save money?

256
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,370
If everyone buys whatever they want,

257
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,410
eats whatever they want,

258
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,190
the company's profit decreases,

259
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,070
and there's a crisis in operation,

260
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,220
we can't be paid. What shall we do?

261
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,510
Well.

262
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,950
I can't save money

263
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,780
when I treat the clients.

264
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,770
I've checked your receipts.

265
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,620
You spent 30,000 NT dollars

266
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,900
more than last month.

267
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,790
You bought the same gift three times.

268
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,520
Can't you spend the money where it's needed most?

269
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,430
Right.

270
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,300
You're right.

271
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,180
I'll be careful next time.

272
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,480
Well,

273
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,460
this time's receipts...

274
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,260
No!

275
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,070
I won't approve them.

276
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,870
I've submitted that application form

277
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,660
eight times.

278
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,630
It's quite interesting.

279
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,320
Not at all.

280
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,860
Jian Keke is a famous accountant.

281
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,060
Every expense that goes through her hands

282
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,650
must be meticulously budgeted to the utmost.

283
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,980
All departments

284
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,200
are a little afraid of her.

285
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,120
That makes her a very competent accountant.

286
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,890
This is a good thing for the company.

287
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,190
That's true.

288
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,440
But our Business De...

289
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,910
I heard that a few days ago,

290
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,430
she held a press conference

291
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,830
for the Marketing & Public Relations Department,

292
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,030
and saved a lot of money for the company.

293
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,700
Is that true?

294
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,370
Yes.

295
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,130
-But I still think...
-That means...

296
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,270
She's not only interesting

297
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,450
but also works hard.

298
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,880
And

299
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,930
she's kind and helpful.

300
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,920
It sounds like

301
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,460
she is really nice.

302
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,150
You spent 30 NT dollars

303
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,960
for that man named Haikuo?

304
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,490
30 NT dollars!

305
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,450
I wanted to go head-to-head with Elly,

306
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,010
but I got myself.

307
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,550
But it's okay.

308
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,839
Consider it as repaying his kindness.

309
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,640
He helped me avoid the wedding invitation before.

310
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,990
Well...

311
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,340
Is he handsome?

312
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,490
Not bad.

313
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,770
I've decided.

314
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,310
I'll buy the expensive pair.

315
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,740
The insole is soft.

316
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,690
My dad will feel more comfortable when wearing them.

317
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,300
I'll ask her if they have the size I want.

318
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,560
Please check for me

319
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,480
if you have this size.

320
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,180
Okay.

321
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,410
I want this pair.

322
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,330
Okay, wait a moment.

323
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,030
Thank you.

324
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,710
And this pair.

325
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,080
Hello.

326
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,680
Do you want to pay together or separately?

327
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,940
We'll pay separately.

328
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,090
Let's pay together.

329
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,790
Swipe your card.

330
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,080
Two pairs of shoes cost 1998.

331
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,550
There's a credit card discount available today.

332
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,140
16% makes it 319.68.

333
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,890
If rounded, it's 320 NT dollars.

334
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,950
Then it will be 1678.

335
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,380
Besides, today is Thursday,

336
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,790
and there's three percent cashback,

337
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,780
meaning 50.34.

338
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,220
If rounded, it's 50 NT dollars.

339
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,390
The total amount will be 1628 NT dollars.

340
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,450
Sorry to bother you again. Thank you.

341
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,480
Okay.

342
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,600
Hold on.

343
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,700
This will do.

344
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,560
Hold on. I'll wrap them up for you.

345
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,380
I even gave her the discount.

346
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,550
He made you wait

347
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,500
at least an hour every time.

348
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,050
If your time were paid by the hour,

349
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,060
I don't know how much he owes you.

350
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,460
Why did you buy him shoes?

351
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,030
It's not an hour this time.

352
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,840
Just 50 minutes.

353
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,320
Is there a difference?

354
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,090
About 20 NT dollars.

355
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,390
Sun Jiali.

356
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,830
Alright.

357
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,030
But at least

358
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,690
he finally came to pick me up.

359
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,230
It's not about whether he came to pick you up or not.

360
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,060
It's that he always makes you wait until midnight.

361
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,260
Okay, I got it.

362
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,590
I'll talk to him again.

363
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,760
You always say that.

364
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,310
Jiali, be careful.

365
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,470
Keke, are you hurt?

366
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,580
No.

367
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,980
I just sprained my ankle.

368
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,170
Are you okay?

369
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,060
I'm fine.

370
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,870
I suggest you go to the hospital.

371
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,400
Why are you here?

372
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,460
You know each other?

373
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,740
Wang Haikuo.

374
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,730
Fortunately, you just hit the ground.

375
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,060
There are no fractures.

376
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,990
It's not that fragile.

377
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,990
I've sent you the video

378
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,080
from my dashcam.

379
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,030
It contains the whole process of his hit-and-run.

380
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,410
No wonder you didn't follow him.

381
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,830
So you got the evidence.

382
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,010
It's more convenient to hand the video to the police.

383
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,020
It's also easier to handle in this way.

384
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,100
You're really smart.

385
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,360
You're so thoughtful.

386
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,800
Are you okay?

387
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,730
You don't look well.

388
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,010
You haven't had enough rest, have you?

389
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,200
Look, even others can tell.

390
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,960
She

391
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,510
waited for her boyfriend

392
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,050
to pick her up

393
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,980
until dawn.

394
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,320
-Then she had to get up at 8 a.m...
-Keke.

395
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,550
Okay, I will stop.

396
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,680
I'll teach you how to press an acupoint

397
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,930
to cheer you up.

398
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,880
This acupoint is called Neiguan Point.

399
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,920
Pressing it can heal your body and reduce your fatigue.

400
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,560
It takes about three to five minutes per time.

401
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,890
You just need to keep pressing it until you feel sore.

402
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,850
If there is no sense of soreness,

403
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,990
you can massage it countless times.

404
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,190
Is it sore?

405
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,820
Yes. Yes.

406
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,460
I didn't know pressing on the Neiguan Point could boost our appetite.

407
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,380
Right.

408
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,850
I'm in high spirits

409
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,310
so I want to eat something.

410
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,740
Let's go home and eat.

411
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,560
Thank you so much for today.

412
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,630
Shouldn't we call the police first?

413
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,490
Of course, we should.

414
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,080
Anyway, we have evidence now.

415
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,990
We can report it anytime.

416
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,710
Thank you.

417
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,110
Why are you walking so fast?

418
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,690
Well. My stomach was growling so loudly.

419
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,790
It was awkward.

420
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,680
But he just saved us.

421
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,410
Should we just leave like this?

422
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,970
I owe him a meal anyway.

423
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,510
I'll give him a better treat next time to repay him.

424
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,720
Did your boyfriend reply to your message?

425
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,970
Not yet.

426
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,750
Not yet? What time is it now?

427
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,410
It's been so long.

428
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,510
He hasn't replied yet...

429
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,750
Are you hungry?

430
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,820
Let's take a taxi to go back for dinner.

431
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,460
No.

432
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,190
We have to take the bus no matter how hungry we are.

433
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,460
Why hasn't he replied yet?

434
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,590
Isn't that too much?

435
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,020
Manager, why are you late?

436
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,910
It's not easy for you to arrange a meeting with Mr. Zhang.

437
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,060
Why are you here?

438
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,120
Where is Mr. Zhang?

439
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,340
He has already left.

440
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,050
Because you're late

441
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,230
for nearly an hour.

442
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,780
You didn't answer my phone.

443
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,570
I tried my best to stop him.

444
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,160
But Mr. Zhang thought

445
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,530
he wasn't valued,

446
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,040
so he left in anger.

447
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,510
I'm sorry.

448
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,580
Why are you apologizing?

449
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,110
Because I didn't manage to keep him here.

450
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,310
It's not your fault.

451
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,440
Why blame yourself?

452
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,580
Manager,

453
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,860
you're truly a good person.

454
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,220
You're a good person.

455
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,950
Have you

456
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,660
been hurt before?

457
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,990
You're so easily moved.

458
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,040
What should we do now?

459
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,030
Don't worry. I have a plan.

460
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,090
I knew you would have a solution.

461
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,000
You're the best.

462
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,900
You're the best.

463
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
You can hug me.

464
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,310
But can you stop moving back and forth?

465
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,710
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,320
You're strong.

467
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,200
Are you that hungry?

468
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,130
Are your injuries

469
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,350
okay?

470
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,990
Just minor scratches.

471
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,180
So,

472
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,360
does being injured affect your appetite?

473
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,260
Otherwise, how come you're so hungry, Keke?

474
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,830
Neiguan Point.

475
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,260
Neiguan Point?

476
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,610
Dad.

477
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,230
I have something for you.

478
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,680
What is it?

479
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,460
For me?

480
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,260
What?

481
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,280
A pair of shoes.

482
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,470
New shoes!

483
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,600
999?

484
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,050
Return them now.

485
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,520
Return them. They're too expensive.

486
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,330
Don't waste money on me.

487
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:10,990
No, Dad.

488
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,980
Your old shoes have been worn out for so long.

489
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,110
You're reluctant to change them

490
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,260
even though the soles are worn flat.

491
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,920
So, I wanted to buy you a new pair.

492
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,180
And I received a bonus.

493
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,020
Plus, there's a discount too, Uncle Jian.

494
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,930
Really?

495
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,340
But it's still too expensive.

496
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,480
This is love from your daughter.

497
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,340
If you don't want them,

498
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:29,950
then

499
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,470
I'll exchange them for mine.

500
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,550
No way.

501
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,550
My daughter bought them for me.

502
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,530
You dare not.

503
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,330
Jiali.

504
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,230
last time your grandma said

505
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,760
the radish pickle I made was delicious.

506
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,730
Bring two more bottles home.

507
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,480
Thank you, Auntie.

508
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,910
You're welcome.

509
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,320
I'll take them to Grandma this weekend.

510
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,230
She needs to work at the shop.

511
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,960
I'll have dinner with Grandma.

512
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,360
Okay.

513
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,270
What are you waiting for?

514
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,490
Eat up.

515
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,220
Eat.

516
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,840
Come on, eat.

517
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,650
By the way, Jiali,

518
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,850
What did you just say? What point?

519
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,370
Neiguan Point?

520
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,960
What is that?

521
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,570
Neiguan Point.

522
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,950
Neiguan Point is here.

523
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,300
Just now...

524
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,630
What's wrong?

525
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,750
Luckily, I haven't made a move on him.

526
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,990
Otherwise,

527
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,880
it would've been all for nothing.

528
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,950
Everyone says

529
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,380
he's very competent.

530
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,890
Didn't expect him to stumble so soon.

531
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,150
I knew it.

532
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,310
A rich second-generation like him

533
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,980
can't just rely on his abilities to get into the company.

534
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,180
It's more likely that

535
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,940
he got in through connections.

536
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,320
I heard that Mr. Zhang

537
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,090
is very particular about every detail.

538
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,040
Looks like the company is going to lose a big deal.

539
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,480
Then he will be doomed this time.

540
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,960
It depends on how he cleans up the mess.

541
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,110
Who are you talking about?

542
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,980
The new business manager, Wang Haikuo.

543
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,730
What's wrong with him?

544
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,680
Don't you know?

545
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,500
Last night,

546
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,630
he stood up a big client of the company last night

547
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,620
and made him wait for over an hour.

548
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,800
Looks like he's in big trouble this time.

549
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,770
What's wrong with her?

550
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,440
Wang Haikuo.

551
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,320
Keke.

552
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,870
Is it because of the accident the other day

553
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,470
that you didn't go to Mr. Zhang's appointment?

554
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,350
It's not like that.

555
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,890
Should I go and explain to Mr. Zhang for you?

556
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,860
You were delayed

557
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,060
because you helped us.

558
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,830
Otherwise, I'll show him the dashcam footage.

559
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,290
I think he'll understand.

560
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,570
Calm down.

561
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,250
I've already sorted it out, don't worry.

562
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,820
How can I not worry?

563
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,850
You got delayed because of me.

564
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,220
And that caused the company to lose a big order.

565
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,080
It's not your fault.

566
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,250
This is my decision.

567
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,290
I'll bear the consequences

568
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,580
of my decision.

569
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,070
Jian Keke.

570
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,730
This

571
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,640
has nothing to do with you.

572
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,530
Nothing to do with me?

573
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,490
Has Haikuo told you

574
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,340
how he plans to handle Mr. Zhang?

575
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,660
I don't know.

576
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,600
You don't know?

577
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,520
You're his work partner.

578
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,780
How could you not know?

579
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,710
Because he instructed me

580
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,900
(not to tell you).

581
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,420
You can't tell me?

582
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,250
When a man

583
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,240
steps into the work world,

584
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,400
his life and death aren't up to him.

585
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,320
Then I'm afraid

586
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,020
your application for reimbursement

587
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,050
won't be passed easily.

588
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,270
Haikuo said

589
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,950
you are a warm and kind person.

590
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,800
You...

591
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,170
I am.

592
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,850
But that depends on your performance.

593
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,250
[Saturday]

594
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,530
[Good morning.]

595
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,730
What a wonderful day!

596
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,230
Delicious.

597
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,190
Honey, time for breakfast.

598
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,960
Coming.

599
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,030
Here.

600
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,250
Smells good.

601
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,100
Yes.

602
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,850
You are so radiant.

603
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,550
Dad, Mum, good morning.

604
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,160
Morning.

605
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,340
Good morning.

606
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,760
You are full of energy early in the morning.

607
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,470
Because I'm a grateful person.

608
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,330
I want to be true to my conscience.

609
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,300
Yes.

610
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,560
Wait

611
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
Are you going to see Grandma?

612
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,410
Here, take these two bottles of radish pickle with you.

613
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,080
Here.

614
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,030
I'll visit Grandma this evening.

615
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,230
I won't be back for dinner.

616
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,330
Okay, bye.

617
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,400
Wait.

618
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,090
Aren't you having breakfast?

619
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,110
No.

620
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,670
You can't skip breakfast. It's important.

621
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,130
You need to have breakfast.

622
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,180
I'm in a hurry.

623
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,370
This girl.

624
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,520
Bye.

625
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,970
Look, Keke is full of energy.

626
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,450
Who's so rude to park the car here?

627
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,550
It can't stop me.

628
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,080
No,

629
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,890
she just said

630
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,520
she's going to see Grandma later in the evening.

631
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,870
Why is she leaving now?

632
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
-To save bus fare,
-To save bus fare,

633
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,220
-she'll walk there?
-she'll walk there?

634
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,070
That silly girl.

635
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,390
Manager,

636
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,630
the wine Mr. Zhang likes

637
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,860
is really hard to buy.

638
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,340
I managed to get it through one of my clients.

639
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,940
Thank you.

640
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,060
If this is done,

641
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,750
I'll give you my share of the bonus.

642
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,260
Really?

643
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,730
I'm leaving.

644
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,860
Manager, good luck.

645
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,860
I'm counting on you for my bonus.

646
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,110
Oh.

647
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,300
the target has set off.

648
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,390
Hello.

649
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,330
I'm Wang Haikuo, the business manager of Trendee.

650
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,330
I have an appointment with Mr. Zhang Zhanpeng today.

651
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,760
Please wait a moment. Let me check.

652
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,300
Okay.

653
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,219
Here's a Mr. Wang Haikuo

654
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,860
looking for Mr. Zhang Zhanpeng.

655
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,090
Okay, thank you.

656
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,940
Mr. Zhang is waiting for you in the private room.

657
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,550
Can I check your ID card please?

658
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,280
Our club takes security very seriously,

659
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,510
so we require real-name registration.

660
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,620
Okay, no problem.

661
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,719
Thank you.

662
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,360
The other person as well.

663
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,330
The other one?

664
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,050
What are you doing here?

665
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,650
I want to go with you.

666
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,930
I told you

667
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,540
-it has nothing...
-Don't say

668
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,070
it has nothing to do with me.

669
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,670
I know you're concerned about me,

670
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
that's why you wanted to come alone.

671
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,830
That day at the hospital,

672
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,170
I should have been with you.

673
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,140
After all, this isn't just about the two of us.

674
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,090
I don't want to lose him either.

675
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,390
It's all my fault for making him angry.

676
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,990
That's why it turned out like this.

677
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,230
That's why I can't let you go alone.

678
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,960
Please, let me go with you.

679
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,580
I want to face it with you.

680
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,990
Or

681
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,940
you don't want him anymore?

682
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,490
You want to give up everything

683
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,350
and make me suffer, regret,

684
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,280
and be sad for the rest of my life?

685
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,490
What a jerk.

686
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,110
[Jerk]

687
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,020
Okay, then let's face it together.

688
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,720
Okay.

689
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,750
Thank you.

690
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,340
I didn't expect you to act so well.

691
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,730
Isn't this how it's done in TV dramas?

692
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,260
This club

693
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,390
isn't accessible to ordinary people.

694
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,050
So, what you mean is,

695
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,440
you're not ordinary?

696
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,570
Then how extraordinary are you?

697
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,750
You'll find out later.

698
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,630
I'm not that kind of woman.

699
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,220
Cheers.

700
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,480
Cheers.

701
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,110
Wang Haikuo, Jian Keke.

702
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,740
They managed to book a private room.

703
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,140
What do you mean?

704
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,380
To book a private room here,

705
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,930
you need more than money.

706
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,490
You need some connections.

707
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,720
Please come in.

708
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,680
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

709
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,570
I'm Wang Haikuo.

710
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,740
This is Jian Keke.

711
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,010
I apologize for making you wait

712
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,510
the other day.

713
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,820
Please forgive me

714
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,840
for that.

715
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,730
Mr. Zhang,

716
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Mr. Wang didn't make it to the appointment on time

717
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,230
because he helped me.

718
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,700
I have the footage from that day here.

719
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,610
Mr. Zhang,

720
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,660
since you agreed to see me,

721
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,000
I believe you also don't want to leave empty-handed.

722
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,170
I promise to give you a chance.

723
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,520
Yet you are here

724
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,040
with this bottle of wine and a video clip.

725
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,930
That's it?

726
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,550
It's surprising that with your reputation

727
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,190
in the industry,

728
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,250
you have so little to show.

729
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,500
Mr. Zhang,

730
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,290
the wine is just a token of appreciation.

731
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,870
What I care more

732
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,450
about is your past.

733
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,850
I've been looking for this fermented bean curd

734
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,270
for a long time.

735
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,050
You attached great importance to this product

736
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,890
when you first started in the industry,

737
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,750
and you personally developed it.

738
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,860
But after it was launched,

739
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,420
it didn't attract much attention.

740
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,460
Are you here to mock me?

741
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,760
Absolutely not.

742
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,930
I plan to make it

743
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,160
the best-selling product of the year.

744
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,040
So, I made a detailed evaluation.

745
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,750
Please fill out the questionnaire

746
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,030
after you try it.

747
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,790
Thank you.

748
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,410
And please give your most honest feedback.

749
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,830
Manager, it has a very nostalgic flavor.

750
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,090
Like mom's recipe?

751
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,070
No.

752
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,450
More like grandma's recipe.

753
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,550
This fermented bean curd has a rich flavor,

754
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,480
salty with a hint of sweetness.

755
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,100
And its texture is very solid.

756
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,480
It would be perfect

757
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,810
with a bowl of porridge.

758
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,040
Manager, where can I buy this?

759
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,010
I want to buy some.

760
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,080
I want three jars.

761
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,540
You want three jars?

762
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,750
Then I'll buy four.

763
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,500
Let's just do a group buy.

764
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,370
Sure.

765
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,580
Sure.

766
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,920
It's really good.

767
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,810
I've read every questionnaire here myself.

768
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,080
Of course, there are some opinions,

769
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,750
but most of them are positive,

770
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,490
and surprisingly so.

771
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,160
This product didn't attract much attention back then,

772
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,460
not because of its quality,

773
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,210
but because of marketing issues.

774
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,350
A good product

775
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,930
will always attract buyers.

776
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,330
But if they want to buy it,

777
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,050
they need a good platform.

778
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,470
So, I want to make it

779
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,800
the star product of Trendee for this year,

780
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,480
to help it redeem its past

781
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,190
and help us make money.

782
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,100
You...

783
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,790
Are you okay?

784
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,420
I just felt a little dizzy after I stood up because of anemia.

785
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,180
I'm fine.

786
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,370
Do you want to go home early and rest?

787
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,330
It's the weekend.

788
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,690
Before the shift in the evening, there will only be the two of us.

789
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,780
If I leave, what about you?

790
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,980
It's okay. I can handle it alone.

791
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,190
I know you're worried about me,

792
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,870
but you're still new here,

793
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,340
I think I should stay.

794
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,430
I can do it.

795
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,860
Then I'll restock,

796
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,880
and you can manage the counter.

797
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,090
Okay.

798
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,790
Thank you.

799
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,060
Jiali.

800
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,960
Mr. Zhang.

801
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,560
Don't be nervous. Sit down.

802
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,180
Wang Haikuo, why do you put pressure on him?

803
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,710
Sorry.

804
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,930
Don't be nervous.

805
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,630
Mr. Zhang, are you okay?

806
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,540
You seem very tense.

807
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,380
Do you have any concerns?

808
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,630
To be honest,

809
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,310
I put a lot of effort into this product.

810
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,830
I didn't agree to Mr. Wang's proposal right away

811
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
because I'm afraid I'll fail again.

812
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,820
This fermented bean curd has been ignored for over ten years.

813
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,770
If it re-enters the market,

814
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,990
I'll be worried.

815
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
No more drinking.

816
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,720
Today, I've also prepared a small gift

817
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,470
for you.

818
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,550
What gift?

819
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,760
Open it.

820
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,010
It's Zhang Zhanpeng.

821
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,990
It's Mr. Zhang.

822
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,430
Then why is Jian Keke here?

823
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,260
So, you remember everything clearly?

824
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,940
Yes.

825
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,320
I'm talking about

826
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,850
the first time we met.

827
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,090
You two must be close.

828
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,120
I like her.

829
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,150
I'm chasing her.

830
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:32,560
It's great

831
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,690
to see you again.

832
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,420
Excuse me, someone fainted.

833
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,220
I think this one is good.

834
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,990
Good?

835
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,280
Good enough to be your new boyfriend.

836
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,890
Better than your useless ex-boyfriend.

837
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,350
Could it be you like Jiali?

838
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,780
Elly, aren't you going?

839
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:43,490
No.

840
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,750
Or maybe she's become more demanding.

841
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,240
I want to collaborate with you.

842
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,670
Do you still

843
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,060
like Jian Keke?

844
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,130
Michael Zhao.
