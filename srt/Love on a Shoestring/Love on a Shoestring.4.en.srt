Look at her.

193
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,160
This stubborn little mouth.

194
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,420
Didn't you

195
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,910
buy me a tea egg yesterday?

196
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,460
And today you're saying you don't love me.

197
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,240
It's like

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,730
that song between you and me...

199
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,760
The song that we love the most...

200
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,910
The song that we love the most...

201
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,670
Say One Thing, Mean Another.

202
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,610
I kissed your hand?

203
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,170
So disgusting.

204
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,910
Mr. Zhao.

205
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,430
Why are you in the Accounting Department?

206
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,890
I've been looking for you.

207
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,420
I have something to tell you.

208
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,240
Chen Shi.

209
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,060
Clean up the things on the table.

210
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,690
Yes.

211
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,490
I didn't struggle.

212
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,220
Why did you hold my hand so hard?

213
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,590
I'm so delicate.

214
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,680
If I get hurt,

215
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,390
can you afford it?

216
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,800
Did you just want to kiss Jian Keke's hand?

217
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,390
In the end, I kissed your hand.

218
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,330
So you want to pursue Jian Keke again?

219
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,550
Yes.

220
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,320
Good. Very good.

221
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,730
I like Jian Keke too.

222
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,830
Let's compete fairly.

223
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,170
What did you say?

224
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
I said let's compete fairly.

225
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,370
No.

226
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,740
The second-to-last sentence you just said.

227
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,320
You said I liked Jian Keke.

228
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,860
Did you misunderstand something?

229
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,720
Pursuing her

230
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,500
doesn't necessarily mean

231
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,680
I like her.

232
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,180
Have you never been in a relationship before?

233
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,580
What's your purpose?

234
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,540
To prove myself.

235
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,690
Think about it.

236
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,660
I'm so handsome

237
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,440
and tender.

238
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,390
As long as I smile at those girls,

239
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,170
they will take the initiative

240
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,000
and worship me like a prince.

241
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,220
But Jian Keke is different.

242
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,410
She ignored me.

243
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,300
No matter how hard I tried,

244
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,380
even if I displayed my peacock feathers in front of her,

245
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,490
in her eyes,

246
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,700
there was no passion

247
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,720
admiration,

248
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,340
or desire to scream.

249
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,950
It hurts my pride.

250
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,140
Pride?

251
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,330
Yes.

252
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,220
Pride is important

253
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,580
to a man.

254
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,760
Jian Keke is human.

255
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,960
She has feelings.

256
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,600
She'll get hurt too.

257
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,940
She's not a trophy

258
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,470
to satisfy your pride.

259
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,420
I

260
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,780
will win her over.

261
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,630
You

262
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,930
should take some medicine.

263
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,900
I should take my medicine?

264
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,140
How did he know I had a cold?

265
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,810
Manager.

266
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,850
I'm really sorry about today.

267
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,880
I don't know

268
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,700
why that happened this morning.

269
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,600
But I didn't steal anyone's boyfriend.

270
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,880
Zhigang and I have been together for years.

271
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,110
You saw us too.

272
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,140
Jiali.

273
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,920
I don't care about your love life.

274
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,420
I just hope that this kind of thing

275
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,030
won't happen again.

276
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,290
Take care of your personal affairs.

277
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,480
Don't affect the business

278
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,670
and reputation of our shop.

279
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,920
I know.

280
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,490
I'll take care of it.

281
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,190
I trust you.

282
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,849
But I have to remind you.

283
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,740
If this happens again,

284
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,380
I might have to ask you to leave.

285
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,730
But

286
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,310
I'm the only one

287
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,220
who can make strawberry Soufflé.

288
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,770
Even if you're the only one who can make it now,

289
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,810
no one can't be replaced.

290
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,110
Got it.

291
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,570
Even if you're the only one who can make it now,

292
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,290
no one can't be replaced.

293
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,480
Jiali.

294
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,640
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,700
I know you're still angry.

296
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,510
But please let me explain.

297
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,420
[Jiali's boyfriend
Wu Zhigang
Unknowledgeable scumbag]

298
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,990
Okay, then explain

299
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,870
what happened to that bracelet.

300
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,820
And why did that girl

301
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,880
scold me for stealing her boyfriend?

302
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,650
That girl's name is Gao Weishan.

303
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,140
We met online.

304
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,150
I admit

305
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,560
she would call me "Husband"

306
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,790
on the Internet.

307
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,400
But...

308
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,370
But I really don't like her.

309
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,850
What about the bracelet?

310
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,700
You said it was specially made for me

311
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,270
and that was the only one in the world.

312
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,600
Why does she have it too?

313
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,090
I really asked someone

314
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,630
to customize it.

315
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But when I

316
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,070
got it,

317
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,490
I posted it in the group chat.

318
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,800
She saw it.

319
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,870
She insisted on having one too.

320
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,410
So I had to give it to her.

321
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,890
You look pale.

322
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
You didn't get enough rest, did you?

323
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,930
She

324
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,950
waited for her boyfriend to pick her up

325
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,950
until dawn.

326
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,120
-And she had to get up at 8 a.m...
-Keke.

327
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,490
I need you to take good care of yourself.

328
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,670
Don't make us worry anymore.

329
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,470
Okay?

330
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,200
I think...

331
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,550
I don't want to break up.

332
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
Jiali, please.

333
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,290
I don't want to break up.

334
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,230
But...

335
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,290
Jiali.

336
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,030
I just made a mistake.

337
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,360
Please forgive me.

338
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,790
You should know

339
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,850
I really need you.

340
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,760
You need me?

341
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,560
I really need you.

342
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,960
Maybe

343
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,940
your family and friends sometimes need you.

344
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,270
You're not indispensable for your workplace.

345
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,000
But I'm different, Jiali.

346
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,810
I really need you.

347
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,620
You are everything to me.

348
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,560
My whole world.

349
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,790
So don't be angry.

350
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,130
Please forgive me.

351
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,730
Please forgive me.

352
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,010
I...

353
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,930
I swear

354
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,000
I will never make the same mistake again.

355
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,160
I will treat you well with all my heart.

356
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,790
If you're not by my side,

357
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,790
I would be very unhappy

358
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,770
and upset.

359
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,790
So, please.

360
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Don't abandon me.

361
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,220
If you don't talk,

362
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,170
I'll kneel down and apologize to you.

363
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,060
I won't abandon you.

364
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,190
I know it feels bad to be abandoned.

365
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,080
Thank you, Jiali.

366
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,330
I knew you treated me the best.

367
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,020
Thank you.

368
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,910
Alright, let's go.

369
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,930
I'll take you to have a midnight snack, okay?

370
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,020
Alright, don't be angry.

371
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,440
I won't do the same thing again.

372
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,250
Are you ready?

373
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,160
Yes.

374
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,600
Start.

375
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,090
Okay.

376
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,950
I'm not bragging.

377
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,020
I, Master Jian,

378
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,300
have a good taste.

379
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,890
I bought this dress 30 years ago

380
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,820
for your mother.

381
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,880
After 30 years, as long as I trim it a bit,

382
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,540
you can still lead at the forefront of the times.

383
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,230
Come on.

384
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,330
Give me the scissors.

385
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,190
Let me do it.

386
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,030
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

387
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,140
There's one more place to show.

388
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,950
Here.

389
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,340
Be careful.

390
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,880
My daughter's slim waist is so beautiful.

391
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,310
Show it.

392
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,790
Show it to others.

393
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,560
She'll catch a cold if it's exposed.

394
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,740
She won't.

395
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,600
Mom.

396
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,460
Thank you for giving me this dress.

397
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,530
It saved me some money for dressing.

398
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,320
Why do you say that?

399
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,070
For this wedding banquet,

400
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,450
you were having nightmares

401
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,890
and screaming.

402
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,160
You also yelled at someone.

403
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,930
Did I?

404
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,790
Absolutely.

405
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,670
Here, show more of this.

406
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,010
Here.

407
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,230
That's enough.

408
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,830
Do you know where the sexiest part

409
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,340
of a woman is?

410
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,960
No way!

411
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,490
Here comes the pride of a woman.

412
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,410
My daughter is like a mannequin.

413
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,110
You look good in everything you wear.

414
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,800
Look at your figure.

415
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,430
Curvy and well-proportioned.

416
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,750
Thanks to

417
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,500
the papaya pork rib soup I made.

418
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,560
I need to thank genetics as well.

419
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,690
Then it's my credit.

420
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,240
If I had known, I would have eaten all those papayas.

421
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,650
I don't want my daughter

422
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
to go out dressed like this.

423
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,710
What do you even know?

424
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,540
Sweetie,

425
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,000
if you wear this to the wedding,

426
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,030
I bet all the male guests

427
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,470
will be drooling over you.

428
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,450
The line of suitors

429
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,850
will stretch from

430
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
the banquet hall entrance

431
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,440
all the way to our front door!

432
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,910
Alright, stop talking, okay?

433
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,830
It's about time.

434
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,260
-Hurry up and head out.
-Yes.

435
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,160
Yes, I should set off.

436
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,090
Hurry up.

437
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,700
So beautiful.

438
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,510
Be careful.

439
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,080
Hello, Keke.

440
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,540
These should be

441
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,470
your parents.

442
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,320
Hello, I'm Wang Haikuo,

443
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,380
Keke's colleague from work.

444
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,570
I'm here to pick her up.

445
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,020
Pick me up?

446
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,820
No, you just joined the company.

447
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,480
How did you get an invitation?

448
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,950
I asked Joan for one

449
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,500
since I knew you'd be going.

450
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,130
Who's that?

451
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,040
Keke.

452
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,250
Hop in.

453
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,350
I'll drive you to the wedding hall.

454
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,350
Mr. Zhao. You don't seem to know

455
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,630
the concept of first come, first served.

456
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,220
First come, first served?

457
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,180
You mean you arrived first on your motorcycle

458
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,240
to give Keke a ride?

459
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,280
How inconsiderate!

460
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,690
How can a girl in a dress ride on the back of a motorcycle?

461
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,260
Why can't?

462
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,040
Seems like someone is a bit ignorant.

463
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,940
If I were you,

464
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,480
I wouldn't let our lovely Keke ride on a vehicle

465
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,810
with no protection from the wind and rain.

466
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,780
Both of your vehicles are too cheap.

467
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,870
I'm going to take something more expensive.

468
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,110
-What is it?
-What is it?

469
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,070
The subway.

470
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,590
Dad, Mom, I'm leaving.

471
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,460
-Okay.
-Bye.

472
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,320
Bye.

473
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,540
Be careful. Bye.

474
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,550
Keke.

475
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:03,690
Listen...

476
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,410
Don't run. You'll fall.

477
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,060
What are they doing?

478
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,210
Can't you tell?

479
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,410
I'm so

480
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,860
cheered up.

481
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,280
Keke has

482
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,650
found her spring.

483
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
Come in.

484
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,240
Spring!

485
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,870
Why is it so cold?

486
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
Hello.

487
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,860
We're the bride's friends.

488
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,500
Okay.

489
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,920
Your wedding dress is gorgeous.

490
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,750
It really flatters your figure.

491
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,010
I spent forever picking it out.

492
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,390
A woman looks her most beautiful on this day.

493
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,720
She's the focus of everyone's attention.

494
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,120
I'm so envious

495
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,760
that you're getting married before 30.

496
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,640
Elly,

497
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,910
When I throw the bouquet,

498
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,310
you have to catch it.

499
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,740
That's right.

500
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,220
I heard catching the bouquet

501
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,420
brings you happiness

502
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,150
and a quick marriage.

503
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,360
Exactly.

504
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,470
Maybe

505
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,760
by the time I get back from my honeymoon,

506
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,420
I'll hear your good news too.

507
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,060
Yeah.

508
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,590
There are so many people chasing Elly anyway.

509
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,520
You're right.

510
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,560
With so many great guys pursuing me,

511
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,960
I should probably consider settling down.

512
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,960
Yes.

513
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,140
Sign here, please.

514
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,190
She didn't even sign her name.

515
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:07,830
Yes.

516
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,510
And she looked so sad just now.

517
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,470
Could she be the groom's ex-girlfriend?

518
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,450
Possibly.

519
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,580
Please sign here.

520
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,360
Thank you.

521
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,890
Unbelievable.

522
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,590
Another one who didn't sign.

523
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,350
But this man is quite generous.

524
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,810
Not bad.

525
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,490
Hello.

526
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,220
Are you with the bride or groom?

527
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm a friend of the bride's.

528
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
The bride's side. Thank you.

529
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,470
Could you please sign here?

530
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,420
I might be your future boyfriend too.

531
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,220
What's that supposed to mean?

532
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,050
Is it trendy not to sign these days?

533
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,060
Only 600 NT dollars.

534
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,010
-That's way too little.
-Oh, my.

535
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,480
These people

536
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,650
must have some complicated relationship

537
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,660
with the bride or groom.

538
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,640
I think so too.

539
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Hello.

540
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,290
-Is this okay?
-Here.

541
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,460
The photos need to look nicer.

542
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,560
I'll post them online.

543
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,820
Extend your legs a bit.

544
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,370
-Okay.
-Yeah.

545
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,800
Tilt your head a little.

546
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,620
So beautiful!

547
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,390
Keke is here.

548
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,570
Jian Keke.

549
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,100
Did you buy a new dress?

550
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,230
What brand is it?

551
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,850
Why haven't I seen it before?

552
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,270
It's not like you've seen every brand.

553
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,680
This is the latest season design by Master Fuyun.

554
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,400
One of a kind, absolutely unique.

555
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,070
And

556
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,840
you can't buy it.

557
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,540
Keep bragging.

558
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,050
A new dress and a red envelope.

559
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,220
With all the money spent,

560
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,820
you must be bleeding inside.

561
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,840
You've attended so many weddings,

562
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
but it's still not your turn.

563
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,990
I wonder if I'll live long enough

564
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,420
to witness the miracle of you getting married.

565
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,130
Sister.

566
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,090
Michael Zhao.

567
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,440
Keke is here.

568
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,530
(So despicable.)

569
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,220
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,740
You...

571
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,870
Are you okay?

572
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,930
I'm fine. I can't stay here for long.

573
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,390
Keke, where are you going?

574
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,200
I'll go with you.

575
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,340
Keke didn't say she wanted you to accompany her, did she?

576
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,120
Don't you care most about who comes first?

577
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,190
This time, I said it first.

578
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,420
But we ran into each other first.

579
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,390
Let's go.

580
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Then the three of us can go together.

581
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,190
I'm not going anywhere.

582
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,670
Can I just stand here?

583
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,950
-I'll stay with you.
-I'll stay with you.

584
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,630
Thank you for taking me to the hospital that day

585
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,230
and for bringing me nutritional supplements.

586
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,930
You came to my house to visit me that day

587
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,210
but we beat you up.

588
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,420
I hope you weren't hurt.

589
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,780
No, I wasn't.

590
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,690
Is there something you want to tell me?

591
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,660
Did your friend

592
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,070
say anything to you?

593
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,180
Do you mean Keke?

594
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,800
She didn't say anything in particular.

595
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,130
But she did ask me

596
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,680
what kind of person you are.

597
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,360
Don't worry.

598
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,250
I didn't say anything bad about you.

599
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,380
I only said you don't like to talk much.

600
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,260
Where is your bracelet?

601
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
How did you know I had a bracelet?

602
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,480
There was one time when it went missing.

603
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,200
You were so anxious that you almost cried.

604
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,930
I think

605
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,600
this bracelet must be very important to you.

606
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,670
Not anymore.

607
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,460
What did you say?

608
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,880
I said...

609
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,600
I'm afraid of losing it,

610
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,750
so I left it at home.

611
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm going to the counter.

612
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:21,950
Hello.

613
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,500
Excuse me.

614
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,190
I picked up this parcel here yesterday.

615
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,330
But when I got home,

616
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,080
I realized I didn't order this.

617
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,280
Don't panic.

618
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,070
You've probably received a scam package.

619
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,900
Why?

620
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,990
What should I do now?

621
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,780
Don't worry.

622
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,860
You can use the function

623
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,360
in the "Safe Package Pickup"

624
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,350
to request a refund.

625
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,480
Then use your phone to scan

626
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,750
the QR code on the receipt

627
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,880
to file a complaint.

628
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,830
Customer service will then contact you

629
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,610
after they confirm everything.

630
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,860
Then you can get a refund.

631
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,720
Is it this website?

632
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,430
Yes, that's the one.

633
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,400
Then fill in the form.

634
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,470
Jiali.

635
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,250
Why are you here?

636
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,350
I bought you lunch.

637
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,230
It's from your favorite curry rice place.

638
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,350
Don't you have an interview?

639
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,940
No need.

640
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,420
The interviews I had earlier went quite smoothly.

641
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,360
Your boyfriend will have

642
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,840
a good job very soon.

643
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,360
Really?

644
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,490
Of course.

645
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,410
Your boyfriend is awesome.

646
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,100
I will assure you

647
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,080
a good life in the future.

648
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,620
You're not wearing it.

649
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,270
Well,

650
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,840
it's okay if you don't wear it.

651
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,370
As long as you're not angry.

652
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,570
I promise

653
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,170
I will make another bracelet

654
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,930
that is truly unique, just for you.

655
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,420
And

656
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,550
I definitely won't give it to any other girl.

657
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,760
I've filled it out. Thank you.

658
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,520
With your help, I won't be scammed.

659
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,350
There are many scams now.

660
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,969
Some people scam for money and some scam for sex.

661
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,100
You have to be careful.

662
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,300
Okay, thank you.

663
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,469
You...

664
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,330
Who are you calling a scammer?

665
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,489
I can't focus on my work with you here.

666
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,790
Why don't you wait for me at the internet cafe nearby?

667
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,429
Okay.

668
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,770
I'll do as you say.

669
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,380
I'll pick you up

670
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,670
after you get off work.

671
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,420
Remember to eat it.

672
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:36,639
Bye.

673
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,480
Bye.

674
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,570
Any other questions?

675
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,320
After they receive it,

676
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,949
they will notify you.

677
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,350
-Okay.
-You can get a refund then.

678
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,000
Okay. Thank you.

679
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,900
So I just press this, right?

680
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,500
Yes.

681
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,000
Okay.

682
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,880
-Thank you.
-About the bracelet,

683
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,330
I hope Yuanchong didn't hear all that.

684
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,120
Let's take some photos. Come closer.

685
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,870
Okay.

686
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,800
One, two, three.

687
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,210
Eat more vegetables.

688
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,790
Vegetables are rich in

689
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,460
vitamins A, B, C, D, E...

690
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,060
-They're great for your skin...
-I don't want to eat vegetables.

691
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,690
Thank you.

692
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,950
Then how about some seafood?

693
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,940
White meat is better than red meat.

694
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,230
But I just want to eat red meat.

695
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,380
Red meat is good too.

696
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,500
Have some water.

697
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,300
Your mouth might get dry from eating too much.

698
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,950
Thank you.

699
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,380
You can wipe your mouth after drinking.

700
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,610
You are so sweet.

701
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,250
Keke.

702
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,120
To prove my determination,

703
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,620
I've decided to get

704
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,350
the only bride bouquet for you.

705
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,160
Just wait.

706
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,180
I don't want the bouquet.

707
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,210
Okay. Thank you.

708
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,630
Thank you for coming today.

709
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,960
Are we done with the photos?

710
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,560
The bride should be getting ready to toss the bouquet, right?

711
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,210
Okay.

712
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,420
Girls, come quickly.

713
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,630
The bride is about to throw the bouquet.

714
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,750
Later, Joan will throw the bouquet

715
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,050
in my direction.

716
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,490
Yu Fen and I will help you block everyone.

717
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,860
Thank you.

718
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,850
Michael Zhao.

719
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,310
Why are you also trying to catch the bouquet?

720
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,650
He must be trying to get it for Jian Keke.

721
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,350
But I don't think

722
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,530
he'll succeed.

723
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,570
That's for sure.

724
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,040
I'm going to toss it now!

725
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,860
One.

726
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,670
Two.

727
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,960
Three.

728
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,770
Go away.

729
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,660
Go away!

730
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,810
Go away!

731
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,460
How did Haikuo take the bouquet?

732
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,110
What's he going to do with it?

733
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,180
Jian Keke.

734
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
I like you.

735
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,590
Will you be my girlfriend?

736
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,390
Keke.

737
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,000
Tell me.

738
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,730
Do you want to get married?

739
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,810
No.

740
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,410
Then why did you

741
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,940
catch the bouquet?

742
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,980
That's because I...

743
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,840
I understand.

744
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,580
Our Keke is all grown up.

745
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,380
This day was bound to come sooner or later.

746
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,090
But it has come too soon!

747
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,050
Stop.

748
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,460
I told you

749
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,530
I didn't catch the bouquet myself.

750
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,760
Someone gave it to me.

751
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,090
Who would catch the bouquet

752
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,750
to give it to others?

753
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,730
Exactly.

754
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,430
The man

755
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,590
who wanted to pick me up in the morning.

756
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,040
But there were two men this morning.

757
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,170
Which one?

758
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,190
The one riding the motorcycle, Haikuo!

759
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,180
After he got the bouquet,

760
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,620
he even confessed to me.

761
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,250
Who would've thought that our Keke

762
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,180
would have two men pursuing her at once?

763
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,670
Keke.

764
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,410
Are you going to

765
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,740
be a two-timer?

766
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,980
No way.

767
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,770
Michael Zhao.

768
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,570
I'm talking about

769
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,050
the guy who drove the car this morning.

770
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,850
He's just an extremely narcissistic jerk.

771
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,270
He doesn't like me at all.

772
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,290
As for Haikuo...

773
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,380
Jian Keke.

774
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,830
I sincerely hope

775
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,250
that in front of all these witnesses,

776
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,600
you'll agree to be my girlfriend.

777
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,590
His acting is very good!

778
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,160
I agree.

779
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,430
That's great.

780
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,790
Thank you, Jian Keke.

781
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,900
I will make you happy.

782
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,310
Thank you.

783
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,570
Congratulations, Manager.

784
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,170
Congratulations, Mr. Wang.

785
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,550
Congratulations.

786
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,220
Congratulations.

787
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,650
Congratulations, Manager.

788
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,920
Congratulations, Manager.

789
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,900
It's a pity that you didn't see Elly's expression.

790
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,430
I really wanted to record it.

791
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,790
It was too classic.

792
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,560
Serves her right for cutting my bonus.

793
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,610
Why does it sound weird?

794
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
How?

795
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,030
So you think Haikuo was helping you out?

796
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,110
He wasn't confessing to you for real?

797
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,180
Yeah, he was helping me out.

798
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:03,150
Because he knows how annoying Michael Zhao is.

799
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,080
Really?

800
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,980
You two didn't plan this out beforehand.

801
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,460
You didn't have it all arranged,

802
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,530
and then he could confess to you

803
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,400
in front of everyone?

804
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,690
You're saying

805
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,340
this was all an act?

806
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,050
Yes.

807
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,660
Dad, listen.

808
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,510
This is called being in sync.

809
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,050
Our tacit understanding is perfect.

810
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,510
Plus, he mentioned the keywords

811
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,440
"in front of everyone."

812
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,520
That's what you think.

813
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,500
Maybe Haikuo

814
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,670
really likes you.

815
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,060
[Preview]

816
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:42,930
Jian Keke.

817
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,010
Please

818
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,010
check all the information

819
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,630
you just gave me.

820
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,470
I have no obligation to help you.

821
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,920
Acting?

822
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,150
According to a man's instinct,

823
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,910
I think

824
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,180
Wang Haikuo is serious.

825
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,240
We need to find a way

826
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,150
to make Keke stay away from Haikuo.

827
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,080
Must break up.

828
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,830
And make a clean break.

829
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,690
It's good for both sides.

830
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,560
You're breaking my heart.

831
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,190
You blame me for still being in touch with Weishan.

832
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,330
You are not any better.

833
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,340
Watch your mouth.

834
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,310
If he really likes you,

835
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,920
I won't let you wait for a second.

836
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,880
Do you know

837
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,350
where your happiness lies?
