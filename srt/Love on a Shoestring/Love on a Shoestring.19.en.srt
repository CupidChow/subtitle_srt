[Episode 19]

4
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,950
You haven't sent me your home address yet.

5
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,310
Just drive to your house.

6
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,280
My house?

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,380
Why?

8
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,990
Because from today onwards,

9
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm going to live in your house.

10
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,850
I want to live with you.

11
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,729
Are you kidding me?

12
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,789
Why should we suddenly live together?

13
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,990
If you don't understand

14
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,500
what I just said,

15
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,360
I'm going to tell you directly.

16
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,540
Michael Zhao,

17
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,290
listen carefully.

18
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,920
I like you.

19
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,800
What are you doing?

20
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,740
I'm looking for the voice recorder.

21
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,079
You must be kidding.

22
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,630
You don't believe me, right?

23
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,850
Fine.

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm going to prove it to you.

25
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,070
So dirty!

26
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,340
Dirty?

27
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,000
You think I'm dirty?

28
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,700
No.

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,560
That's not what I mean.

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,590
I mean...

31
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,930
I haven't...

32
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,880
Michael Zhao!

33
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,050
Michael Zhao!

34
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,530
You are abandoning your car and running away, right?

35
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,220
Fine.

36
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,510
Drink slowly.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,930
Are you feeling better?

38
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

39
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,090
I know you did it for Haikuo's good.

40
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,850
But every family has a skeleton in the closet.

41
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,820
I think you should

42
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,240
get to know him better.

43
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,390
It's better that you take the initiative to talk to him.

44
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,300
I'm such an idiot.

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,600
I thought I could help reconcile them like this.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,190
Instead, I made him angry.

47
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,550
He just left.

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,810
Even if he breaks up with me tomorrow,

49
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,430
I wouldn't be surprised.

50
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,940
Don't think too much.

51
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,880
It wasn't easy for him to make you his girlfriend.

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,010
Do you think he'll let you go so easily?

53
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,950
I'm not sure.

54
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,870
I've never seen him so angry.

55
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,810
He's not mad at you.

56
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,900
He's mad at money.

57
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,640
You cherish money so much,

58
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,070
but he hates money like it's his enemy.

59
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,630
You two are a perfect match.

60
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,500
Sun Jiali, you think we're a perfect match?

61
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,820
We're totally different, okay?

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,870
Alright.

63
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,820
Do you know how to comfort someone or not?

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,650
Alright.

65
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,140
Just talk to him properly

66
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,500
after he calms down.

67
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,140
He will understand you.

68
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,090
Since you called a taxi,

69
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,620
why did you come to my house

70
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,560
instead of going back to your house?

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,260
I was greatly shocked today.

72
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,210
I dare not go home to sleep alone.

73
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,710
Are you sure Elly...

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,900
is serious?

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,630
Of course she's serious.

76
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,090
She kissed me directly.

77
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,810
Besides, it was not a thank-you kiss this time.

78
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,560
I was so scared.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
What do you plan to do?

80
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,230
I don't know either.

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,159
I'm also puzzled.

82
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,060
Why would Elly fall in love

83
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,190
with a man like me?

84
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,490
I think it's so strange.

85
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,990
You want all women in the world

86
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,490
to fall in love with you, right?

87
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,060
Back then,

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,420
Keke ignored you,

89
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
so you tried your best to pursue her.

90
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,290
Did you do something

91
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,620
to let Keke down?

92
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,750
Why are you asking this?

93
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,700
Because when you mentioned Keke just now,

94
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,230
I heard that your voice trembled for 0.1 seconds.

95
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,960
Also, your ending intonation had a slight upward inflection.

96
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,950
You're feeling a little guilty.

97
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,790
My...

98
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,340
attitude towards her today

99
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,550
scared her.

100
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,710
It's no big deal.

101
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,659
Girls would often

102
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,370
be scared by our

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,860
small surprises.

104
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,900
It's okay.

105
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,020
Everything will be fine if you apologize properly.

106
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,400
In a relationship,

107
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,810
one of the biggest taboos is

108
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,520
for the boy to yell at the girl.

109
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,420
In addition, if the boy pulls away

110
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,280
when the girl is grabbing his arm,

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,210
that would be very ungraceful.

112
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,920
It would be worse if the boy

113
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,100
wouldn't apologize

114
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,330
or comfort the girl

115
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,010
and just leaves her in the end.

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,530
A man like this

117
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,860
is totally a scumbag

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,650
and a jerk.

119
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,680
This kind of man is worse than an animal.

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
It's normal

121
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,980
even if a man like this gets dumped.

122
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,090
I'm so mad.

123
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,970
But bro,

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,390
I've known you for quite some time.

125
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,640
You're definitely not this kind of person.

126
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,560
You go apologize to Keke properly tomorrow, and everything will be fine.

127
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,300
Okay?

128
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,140
Sleep.

129
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,890
I wonder

130
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,980
if Haikuo is still angry.

131
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,909
If I apologize to him,

132
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,670
I guess he'll talk to me, right?

133
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,310
Why did you come to my house so early?

134
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,350
Keke.

135
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,100
I'm here...

136
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,580
to apologize to you.

137
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,980
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,120
My...

139
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,659
attitude towards you

140
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,490
was poor and scared you.

141
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,970
I made you sad.

142
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,850
I also planned to apologize to you.

143
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,870
I intervened in what's between you

144
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,580
and your father without knowing what happened.

145
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,250
No.

147
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,070
You're my girlfriend.

148
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,650
You'll be my family in the future.

149
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,020
I

150
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,630
didn't tell you the truth.

151
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,860
I made you think my father died.

152
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,300
So...

153
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,140
you don't blame me?

154
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,540
Of course I don't.

155
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,910
Instead...

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,010
I want to ask you

157
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,130
if you can forgive me for hiding it from you.

158
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,590
I don't want my father

159
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,270
to be the barrier between us.

160
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,760
I want to tell you everything.

161
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,020
Do you want to hear it?

162
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,220
Of course.

163
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,620
Although it seems

164
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,280
I hate my father very much now,

165
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,870
actually, I admired him a lot in the past.

166
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,920
I haven't had a meal with you for a long time.

167
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,620
What do you want for dinner later?

168
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,280
Me?

169
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,030
As long as you're willing to accompany me,

170
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,280
anything is fine.

171
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,020
I want pasta.

172
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,770
Okay.

173
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,590
-Later,
-Okay.

174
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,810
let's go eat pasta.

175
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,380
I'm going to answer this call.

176
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
We were a happy family.

177
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,460
But everything...

178
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,180
changed after my grandpa

179
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,710
passed away.

180
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,700
How come I only get this little?

181
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,880
I've never seen this will before either.

182
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,840
This is what is written on the paper.

183
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,380
This is our father's own will.

184
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,150
Changxing,

185
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,630
calm down.

186
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,290
When can an outsider

187
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,550
intervene in the Wang family's affairs?

188
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,000
Wang Changxing!

189
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,890
She is your sister-in-law!

190
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,090
Show some respect!

191
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,250
Sister-in-law,

192
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,840
no wonder you went to the hospital frequently

193
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,510
when our father was hospitalized.

194
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,470
You're so scheming.

195
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,850
You were pretending to be filial.

196
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,830
You can't say that about my mom!

197
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,520
Haikuo,

198
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,290
why did you come in?

199
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,490
You can't be rude to your elders.

200
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,740
I thought only relatives would change

201
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,570
for money.

202
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,610
But I didn't expect

203
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,850
my father, who loved my mother so much...

204
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,790
You're up.

205
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,900
changed too.

206
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,630
Haikuo.

207
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,640
Mom, have some water.

208
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,080
Thank you.

209
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,330
After my mom got sick and was hospitalized,

210
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,490
my father never went to see her.

211
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,800
At that time,

212
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,190
money was

213
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,540
more important to him than anything else.

214
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,950
You father won't ignore me on purpose.

215
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,350
It's really because he is very busy.

216
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,330
Dad.

217
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,450
Mom's illness is worsening.

218
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,190
You should spare time to see her.

219
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,760
She misses you very much, Dad.

220
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,100
Okay, I know.

221
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,670
I'll tell the attending physician

222
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,620
to give your mom the best medicine and the most advanced treatment.

223
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,300
Okay?

224
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm going to have a meeting.

225
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,790
Is there anyone your mother wants to see?

226
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,190
Ask them to come here now.

227
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,290
It's not that my mom was not lonely.

228
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,200
She just didn't want to affect my father.

229
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,010
But what did she get in the end?

230
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,550
She just wanted to see my father,

231
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,230
but she couldn't.

232
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,390
Because my father only cared about money at that time.

233
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,600
He let her die alone in the end.

234
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,210
Your mother

235
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,600
was not lonely.

236
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,120
She had you.

237
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,810
You were with her in her last days, right?

238
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,870
That's different.

239
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,890
So I can never forgive him.

240
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,920
He attached more importance to money than his family members.

241
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,850
Money is so scary.

242
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,700
What's scary is not money,

243
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,640
but people.

244
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,340
Yes.

245
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,620
My father

246
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,450
cares about money and power very much,

247
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,790
so I want to do exactly the opposite.

248
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,730
I want to get rid of these constraints.

249
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,610
That's why you spend money like water?

250
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,690
You don't agree with me?

251
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,540
It's not that I don't agree.

252
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
I can understand.

253
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,940
Are you willing to support me?

254
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,270
Yes.

255
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
I've never told anyone about this.

256
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,320
But you are different.

257
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,050
You are very important to me.

258
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,700
I want to have your support.

259
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,080
Elly,

260
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,760
why are you standing here?

261
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,700
I'm waiting for Michael Zhao.

262
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,330
I already confessed my love to him.

263
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,000
This time,

264
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,950
I must make him fall in love with me.

265
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,540
He's here.

266
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,700
Did he just...

267
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,450
pretend not to see Elly?

268
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,250
Does he want to die?

269
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,170
So I don't think I can help.

270
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,340
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,550
Looks like Haikuo has told you everything.

272
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,020
But people should be far-sighted.

273
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,930
Although Haikuo currently

274
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,620
has a grudge against me,

275
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,630
he is still my son.

276
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,270
One day,

277
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,800
we will be reconciled.

278
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,570
By that time,

279
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,100
he will still care about what his father thinks

280
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,540
of his girlfriend.

281
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,740
Compared to being accepted by you,

282
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,800
I care more about Haikuo's feelings.

283
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Since I've promised to support him,

284
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,530
I won't do anything to make him sad again.

285
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,180
President Wang,

286
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,690
I still...

287
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,500
want to tell you something.

288
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,980
Although Haikuo didn't show it,

289
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,120
he admired you a lot in the past.

290
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,990
If you really want

291
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,640
to be reconciled with him,

292
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,450
don't make things difficult for the person around him anymore.

293
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,460
So,

294
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,329
you're threatening me.

295
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,450
I'm not threatening you.

296
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,920
I really hope you two can be reconciled with each other.

297
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,720
Also, by the person he cares about,

298
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,760
I didn't mean me.

299
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,830
I meant Chen Shi.

300
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,870
He's his good partner at work.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,460
He's also his best friend.

302
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,820
If you want

303
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,220
to get closer to Haikuo,

304
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,280
don't make things difficult

305
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,130
for the people around him again

306
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,920
by using those tricks or exploiting personal interests.

307
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,650
Because that will only push Haikuo further away.

308
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,340
I'm leaving.

309
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,830
Contact the general manager of the e-commerce platform.

310
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,570
Tell him

311
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,920
I want to discuss cooperation with him.

312
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,520
Yes.

313
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,750
Clear.

314
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,530
Clear.

315
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,760
What are you looking at?

316
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,260
Be careful.

317
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,850
Where's Michael Zhao?

318
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,910
Can you let go first?

319
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,090
Speak loudly. I can't hear you.

320
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,490
Let... Let go of him first.

321
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,960
He's going to suffocate.

322
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,960
Where's Michael Zhao?

323
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,140
He went to the doctor.

324
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,930
He went to the doctor?

325
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,640
He can't see things.

326
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,550
He's blind?

327
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,870
No.

328
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,110
When you were playing with water in the B&B that day,

329
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,630
his eyes didn't feel comfortable.

330
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,740
He has a stye.

331
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,530
So he can't see things clearly for the time being.

332
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,890
No wonder

333
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,440
he ignored us this morning.

334
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
It turns out he can't see things.

335
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,800
Why are you avoiding me?

336
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,680
I...

337
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm not avoiding you.

338
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,890
I...

339
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,360
I just have a stye

340
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,910
and...

341
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,690
and a slight cough.

342
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,150
I don't care.

343
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,770
What's your reply?

344
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,070
What reply?

345
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,520
I told you I like you.

346
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,440
What's your reply?

347
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,320
Don't push me.

348
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,020
Just tell me

349
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,310
if you like me or not.

350
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,050
This is not something that can be explained easily.

351
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,670
Okay?

352
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,490
Michael Zhao!

353
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,770
Show me your manliness!

354
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,780
Answer me!

355
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,590
I...

356
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,980
Do you like me or not?

357
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,050
Tell me!

358
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,940
The point is not whether I like you or not, okay?

359
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,550
The point is I don't believe

360
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,070
you would

361
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,170
like a man like me.

362
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,160
It tastes sweet.

363
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,360
It's the taste of love.

364
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,340
It tastes sour.

365
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,800
It's also the taste of love.

366
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,460
Are you serious?

367
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,490
Everything you're eating or drinking

368
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,810
tastes like love.

369
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,690
You and Yuanchong are treating me to this meal.

370
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,980
Isn't this because you want to tell me

371
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,640
you two are in a relationship?

372
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,780
So, of course everything I'm eating now

373
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,230
tastes like love.

374
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,790
Besides, this taste

375
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,680
will never disappear

376
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,230
or change.

377
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,590
You're really different when you're in a relationship.

378
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,480
You're full of sweet words.

379
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,740
Every word has become an oath.

380
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,280
You're impressive.

381
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,690
What about your plan to open a bakery?

382
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,100
Callie's Bakery

383
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,560
is now officially in the preparation stage.

384
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,660
Yuanchong won't invest money.

385
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,210
He'll only invest himself.

386
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,310
Invest himself?

387
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,310
What does it mean?

388
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,340
It means except making bread,

389
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,690
I'll take care of everything else

390
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,680
in the bakery.

391
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,980
Also, I plan to learn money-saving methods

392
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,250
from you.

393
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,390
No problem.

394
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,630
By sharing

395
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,260
money-saving methods with you,

396
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,460
I can also find some pleasure in my life.

397
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,300
Haikuo wouldn't forgive you?

398
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,590
That's not it.

399
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,420
I'm seeking a balance between me and Haikuo.

400
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,340
You know we're very different.

401
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,530
If we want to be together, we have to work very hard to adapt.

402
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,530
But you can't always be the one making changes, right?

403
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,090
I don't know if it's good,

404
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,290
but I'll give it a try.

405
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,590
This weekend,

406
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,690
I plan to make a very,

407
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,090
very huge breakthrough.

408
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,730
I'll withdraw a large sum of money to spend.

409
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,130
How much will you withdraw?

410
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,730
20,000 NT dollars?

411
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,630
That much?

412
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,770
She means 2,000 NT dollars.

413
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,980
Yes, the amount of 20,000 NT dollars is too much.

414
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,890
You've really changed a lot

415
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,820
for him.

416
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,580
Is it very hard to spend 2,000 NT dollars a day?

417
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,550
After you learn my essence of saving money,

418
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,350
you'll know that how extravagant it is

419
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,080
to spend 2,000 NT dollars a day.

420
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,860
By the way,

421
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,980
you can write down the conditions you want and give the list to me.

422
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,210
In this way, it's easier for me to select the location

423
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,740
of the shop that will satisfy you.

424
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,250
Okay.

425
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,880
We've arrived.

426
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,650
Do you want to come in and sit for a while?

427
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,390
It's late now.

428
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,430
I don't want to disturb your grandma while she's resting.

429
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,490
I'll go back first.

430
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,220
Okay.

431
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,650
Then go home early.

432
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,670
Good night.

433
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,330
Good night.

434
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,120
This is a good night kiss.

435
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,310
Stop drinking.

436
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,480
Why do you insist that Elly doesn't like you?

437
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,120
Because the man she likes

438
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,460
only has one condition,

439
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,300
that is, he's rich.

440
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,840
Why am I not you?

441
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,490
Not necessarily.

442
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,120
Maybe Elly really loves you.

443
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,410
No.

444
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,300
Women have clear goals and persistence.

445
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,360
Since I was a student in the first grade of primary school,

446
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,490
I've understood it profoundly from my several times' confession of love.

447
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,450
Ziqi, I like you.

448
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,690
You're too short.

449
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,090
Go home and eat more.

450
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,890
Huiqiao, I like you.

451
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,590
You're too short.

452
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,820
Let's wait until you're as tall as me.

453
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,410
Was a young girl in the first grade of primary school

454
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,930
really that tall?

455
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,190
No.

456
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,460
When I confessed my love for the first time, that girl was in the fourth grade.

457
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,260
At the second time, the girl was in the sixth grade.

458
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,200
Why didn't you find someone in the same grade?

459
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,930
Because I pursued a higher-level peak.

460
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,660
Okay. Whatever.

461
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,880
But since

462
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,660
you care

463
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,950
whether Elly really loves you,

464
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,710
it means that

465
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,880
actually, you like her, too.

466
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,040
I like her?

467
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,920
Do I?

468
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,090
People like you

469
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,720
are even afriad of hurting their skin

470
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,650
when they wipe their mouths with tissues.

471
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,290
But you hit someone for the sake of Elly,

472
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,660
and even hurt your middle finger.

473
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,740
That's right.

474
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,160
So, actually, your feelings

475
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,960
for Elly have changed secretly.

476
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,450
What a coincidence.

477
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,630
It hurts. Don't touch it arbitrarily.

478
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,320
What wine is this? It's so bitter.

479
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,490
This is not wine.

480
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,650
I don't drink alcohol.

481
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,810
Drinking alcohol is bad for your health.

482
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,810
Then what is this?

483
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,020
Bitter tea.

484
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,440
Bitter tea?

485
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,660
Yes.

486
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,350
Bitter tea.

487
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,900
Then why did you put it in a wine bottle?

488
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,480
Don't you think this bottle is very beautiful?

489
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,100
It has a great texture.

490
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,350
By using it to store something,

491
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
both the atmosphere and the vibe

492
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,780
have become elegant.

493
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,860
Leave my house now.

494
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,760
Leave at once.

495
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,620
Take the bitter tea with you, too.

496
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,390
No.

497
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,470
-Let...
-Now.

498
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,390
-Let me stay one more night.

499
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,050
No.

500
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,270
-I mean now.
-Please.

501
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,310
You...

502
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,490
Clean the table.

503
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,030
I'm sorry.

504
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,330
What's wrong?

505
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,230
You're very cute today.

506
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,660
So I wasn't cute yesterday?

507
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,520
You are very cute every day.

508
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,640
But you're particularly cute today.

509
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,830
Maybe the reason is that I'm going to have a date with you,

510
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,040
and I'm in a good mood.

511
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:12,750
What's more,

512
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm wearing a new bag today.

513
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,440
It's pretty.

514
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,610
My dad made it.

515
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,460
Really?

516
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,330
By the way,

517
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,820
this is the dating fund I've specially

518
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,160
prepared for today.

519
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,590
I'm going to spend it all.

520
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,490
You're going to spend it all?

521
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,190
This shows my determination

522
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,300
to change for you as l like you.

523
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,340
Today, I happen to have a way to show my regard to you, too.

524
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,280
I'll

525
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,540
cut half of the fund which I'm

526
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,740
going to spend today.

527
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,260
How much was it originally?

528
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,190
Ten thousand NT dollars.

529
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,010
But there are only 5,000 NT dollars left now.

530
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,570
Plus your 2,000 NT dollars,

531
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,830
today, we're going to use up

532
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,970
all these

533
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,150
7,000 NT dollars.

534
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,750
You don't have to be so extreme

535
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,070
as to use up all the money, do you?

536
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,880
Money just belongs to worldly possessions.

537
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,190
We can't be tied by it.

538
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,580
What's more, this is the amount of money

539
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,080
which shows that we're going to change for each other for the first time.

540
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,380
Of course we should spend it all.

541
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,080
Let's go.

542
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,110
Let's go on a date.

543
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,480
Wait!

544
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,760
What's wrong? Are you...

545
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,190
not willing to spend the money?

546
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,000
I still have 50 NT dollars.

547
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,190
Come on!

548
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,210
You're not angry?

549
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,700
It really scared me.

550
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,000
Will this fall?

551
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,360
-Really?
-Are you sure that it won't...

552
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,290
Be careful.

553
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,460
Just be careful.

554
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,530
Be careful.

555
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,620
Thank you.

556
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,450
I'll eat this.

557
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,730
Which one do you like?

558
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,850
That one.

559
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,750
That bear.

560
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,370
Okay.

561
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,540
No problem.

562
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,560
Are you serious?

563
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,590
Sir.

564
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:40,950
All in.

565
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,660
Five hundred NT dollars.

566
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,750
It's true that you can do this.

567
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,680
You're so amazing.

568
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,730
Sir.

569
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,340
I'll pay 300 NT dollars for another round.

570
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,930
Thank you.

571
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,350
Congratulations.

572
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,210
Thank you.

573
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,150
Thank you.

574
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,250
Actually, this is not expensive.

575
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,960
In total, we've just spent...

576
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,350
I don't want to know so much.

577
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,840
Let's continue our date.

578
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,420
Let's go.

579
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,300
Are you tired?

580
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,550
No, I'm not.

581
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,090
Well,

582
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,640
where are we going next?

583
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,160
I don't have any ideas yet.

584
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,060
It's okay.

585
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,420
There's still much time left today.

586
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,220
Take your time to think about it.

587
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,700
My mom wants us to go home for dinner tonight.

588
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,450
In this way, we don't have to spend money on dinner.

589
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,360
Is that okay?

590
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,030
Okay.

591
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,630
Compared with the food outside, Mrs. Jian's cooking

592
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,560
tastes like home

593
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,890
and is more delicious.

594
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,220
Should we go home now?

595
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,190
Wait a moment.

596
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,360
We have 1,765 NT dollars left now.

597
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,290
There's so much money left?

598
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,989
Let's just consider it

599
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,770
as the fund for our next date.

600
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,380
No.

601
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,889
We agreed that we should use up all the money.

602
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,420
We have to keep our promise.

603
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,219
You don't have to be so serious, do you?

604
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,020
Of course I have to be so serious.

605
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,980
This is our first date.

606
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,179
It's very important.

607
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,159
But how can we use up

608
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,199
so much money at one stroke?

609
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:43,800
I have a good way to kill two birds with one stone.

610
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,679
Buying lottery tickets?

611
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,659
We can both do charity and spend the money at the same time.

612
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,460
Isn't it nice?

613
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,880
It seems nice.

614
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,420
Just pick one.

615
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,780
No.

616
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,100
I've never won a lottery for the tickets I bought.

617
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,260
I don't have luck for such kind of wealth.

618
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,790
I think you should pick one.

619
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,350
We're here to spend money for charity,

620
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,480
not to win a lottery.

621
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,820
Don't feel pressured.

622
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,330
You're right.

623
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,010
Okay. I'll pick one.

624
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,250
It's 1,700 NT dollars in total.

625
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,390
Here's the money.

626
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,210
Two thousand NT dollars!

627
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,490
I won a lottery!

628
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,950
Let's go on buying it.

629
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,720
Okay.

630
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
I didn't win a lottery.

631
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,300
What about you?

632
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,300
Three thousand NT dollars.

633
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,410
This is unbelievable.

634
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,210
It's true.

635
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,560
We'll go on buying it.

636
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,190
Okay.

637
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,780
How much money do we have in total now?

638
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,790
Seven thousand NT dollars.

639
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,980
Seven thousand NT dollars?

640
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,370
In that case, the amount of money for our date today

641
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,970
has all come back, hasn't it?

642
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,560
God must hope that

643
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,080
my date today will be free.

644
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,150
I have a way to use up all the 7,000 NT dollars.

645
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,400
I didn't expect that you would donate the money.

646
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,020
[Donation Box]

647
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,920
I think those 7,000 NT dollars

648
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,850
will be used to help lots of people.

649
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,930
I didn't donate all the 7,000 NT dollars.

650
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,580
I've kept 1,000 NT dollars.

651
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,020
Didn't you say that we would spend it all?

652
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,360
I was thinking that

653
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,970
since God let us win a lottery,

654
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,620
he must want us to fulfill some filial duties,

655
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,650
so I kept 1,000 NT dollars

656
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,430
in order to buy some delicious food

657
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,890
for Mr. Jian and Mrs. Jian.

658
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
You even thought of my parents?

659
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,560
Of course.

660
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,240
To me, Mr. Jian and Mrs. Jian

661
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,210
are my family.

662
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
So after we won a lottery,

663
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,420
we should share it with them.

664
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,580
You're so good.

665
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,800
Elly.

666
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,710
Michael Zhao.

667
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,530
What are you doing here?

668
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,970
We've agreed that we're going to live together.

669
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,630
I'm here.

670
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,910
Have we said that we're going to live together?

671
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,600
Previously in the car,

672
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,580
I said I like you.

673
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,000
You abandoned the car and ran away,

674
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,650
but

675
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,030
you didn't object to it.

676
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,230
In the future,

677
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,390
please help me more.

678
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,190
Excuse me.

679
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,560
Where are you going?

680
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,030
I'm going home.

681
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,800
I...

682
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,290
I'm going home.

683
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,360
After you abandoned the car,

684
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,670
I drove your car back to the parking lot of our company.

685
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,930
I happened to find the ID card in your car.

686
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,830
So I know that your home

687
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,940
is over there.

688
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,600
Elly.

689
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,320
That's really not my home.

690
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,890
So you live here?

691
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,360
It's an old house that has been used for 40 years.

692
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,490
The rent is cheaper.

693
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,190
I don't think you will get used to it.

694
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,200
Don't force yourself to do this.

695
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,800
I'm not forcing myself to do this.

696
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,630
I really like you.

697
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,280
There are no elevators in my apartment.

698
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,150
I'm not a weak woman.

699
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,550
Don't underestimate me.

700
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,820
Which floor do you live on?

701
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,530
The fourth floor.

702
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,010
The fourth floor?

703
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,640
Can you do it?

704
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,260
Yes, I can.

705
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,630
Why don't you just give up?

706
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,330
No.

707
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,590
As I'm sincere, I won't compromise so easily.

708
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,760
It's so heavy.

709
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:26,910
You...

710
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,190
Come on. I'll carry you on my back.

711
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,790
You'll carry me on your back?

712
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,600
I think you'll use up your strength soon.

713
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,930
You can't go up, can you?

714
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,480
What about the stuff?

715
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,330
Just leave the suitcase there first.

716
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,080
Let me carry you upstairs first.

717
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,880
I'll come down to fetch it later.

718
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,380
Come on. Don't be shy.

719
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:05,850
Okay.

720
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,740
Do you

721
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,230
need to put me down?

722
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,880
I can walk by myself.

723
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,770
No.

724
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,710
You're so manly.

725
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,860
-Sashimi.
-It's sashimi!

726
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,340
Nigiri Sushi.

727
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,780
They look delicious.

728
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,640
This restaurant was reported on the news last time.

729
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,900
And it's a famous restaurant from Japan.

730
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,620
Its food is very expensive.

731
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,260
This cost a lot of money, didn't it?

732
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,380
We did control ourselves,

733
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,980
so we just simply bought some

734
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,330
sushi, sashimi and grilled food.

735
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,340
There is so much food, and you said you just simply bought it?

736
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,680
It cost a lot of money, didn't it?

737
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,850
Mr. Jian, don't worry.

738
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,780
Today, Keke

739
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,080
won 7,000 NT dollars from a lottery ticket.

740
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,890
-Seven thousand NT dollars?
-Seven thousand NT dollars?

741
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,960
No.

742
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,100
We won 7,000 NT dollars from a lottery ticket,

743
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,860
but we donated 6,000 NT dollars.

744
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,260
Then we spent 1,000 NT dollars buying the food

745
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,600
and brought it back for you.

746
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,130
We've used up all the money.

747
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,670
You offered 2,000 NT dollars for the date today,

748
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,490
while Haikuo offered 5,000 NT dollars.

749
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,130
You won 7,000 NT dollars from a lottery ticket.

750
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,290
You've used up all the money.

751
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,760
So today, you two spent

752
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,260
14,000 NT dollars in total.

753
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,290
It was not 14,000 NT dollars.

754
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,360
It was fourteen thousand

755
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,190
and fifty NT dollars.

756
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,980
How is it? Have I improved?

757
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,490
Is such a habit of spending money

758
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,420
too thrilling for you?

759
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,890
Don't force yourself to do this.

760
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,660
No.

761
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,370
I don't feel reluctant at all.

762
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,240
It's so tiring to date each other.

763
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,400
It's really better to just be yourself.

764
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,550
It's not tiring at all.

765
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,620
I feel very happy.

766
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,990
Just eat.

767
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,270
We specially bought the food for you.

768
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,380
Mr. Jian, Mrs. Jian, just eat now.

769
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,770
[Wasting nothing is the most reassuring.]

770
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,770
[Talking about feelings is harmful for wealth, while talking about money is harmful for our relationship.]

771
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,770
[Family Motto of the Jians]

772
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,160
Okay.

773
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,760
Mr. Jian,

774
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,630
you specially asked me to come out to dump the trash.

775
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,430
Do you have something to tell me?

776
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,550
Come on.

777
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,780
You're

778
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,280
quite smart.

779
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,500
I just want to remind you that

780
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,880
Keke has changed this time

781
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,810
because of you.

782
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,390
But you should know that

783
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,520
she was very resistant to you at first.

784
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,490
I know that

785
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,390
she doesn't like my habit of spending so much money.

786
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,450
It's not that she doesn't like it.

787
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,500
But she has no sense of security.

788
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,190
Why does she have no sense of security?

789
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,400
When she was a kid,

790
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,890
my wife and I

791
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,180
had a cold and got sick at the same time.

792
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,090
Then in order to take care of us,

793
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,820
she couldn't go to school.

794
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,520
So from that moment on,

795
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,320
she deeply felt

796
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,810
the extreme sense of insecurity

797
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,820
as an only child.

798
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,420
Mr. Jian, don't worry.

799
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,360
From now on, Keke won't be the only daughter anymore.

800
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,360
You will have me as your another son.

801
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,010
By the way,

802
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,560
although many people say that Keke

803
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,790
haggles over every detail about the things she does,

804
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,050
and is very stingy,

805
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,800
I have to tell you that

806
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,780
Keke

807
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,250
is the apple of my eye.

808
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,140
If anyone hurts her,

809
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,110
I'll kill him.

810
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,800
Mr. Jian, you don't have to do that yourself.

811
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,260
I'll never let off anyone who

812
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,460
dares to hurt Keke,

813
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,670
including myself.

814
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,590
[Preview]

815
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,220
Vomiting during pregnancy?

816
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,920
It's not mine.

817
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,580
I clearly saw you two leaning on

818
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,320
each other like this.

819
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,550
She's pregnant now.

820
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,700
But you're still hiding it from me?

821
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,720
I live in his home

822
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,460
in order to prove my sincerity.

823
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,530
He's not my boyfriend.

824
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,560
If in the end,

825
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,760
she says that she wants to break up with me...

826
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,730
No, I won't be able to stand it.

827
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,660
I'll be very sad.

828
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,450
Since the first day when you joined the company,

829
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,130
your father has been keeping an eye on you.

830
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:19,950
So it's you.

831
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,180
General manager, I'm sorry.

832
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,270
I can't handle this order.

833
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,500
Haikuo went to the HR Department

834
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,580
to submit his application for resignation.

835
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,370
What?
