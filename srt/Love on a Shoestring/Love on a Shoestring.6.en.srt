[Episode 6]

4
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,820
Well.

5
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,140
My skin is so delicate.

6
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,640
If we really fight,

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,600
what if I get hurt?

8
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,490
Don't worry, okay?

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,690
The people I've hired are professional martial artists.

10
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,789
They're good at fake fighting.

11
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,820
Just swing your hand

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,420
and kick your foot like this.

13
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,960
They cooperate really well.

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,580
Okay?

15
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,890
Then I'm relieved.

16
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,730
You came on a date tonight?

17
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,110
They're here.

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,669
They're here.

19
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,669
Close the window.

20
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,360
Miss.

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,720
You have a nice figure.

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,430
Excuse me.

23
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,050
May I ask

24
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,100
what you want?

25
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,650
The martial artists you found

26
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,250
are not good at saying lines.

27
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,590
They speak without soul,

28
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,720
and without the ups and downs of emotion.

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,050
Is it time to criticize acting skills now?

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,290
We're asking the lady. None of your business.

31
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,750
Go away!

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,740
Just talk. No need for action.

33
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,410
What?

34
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,120
Want to play the hero?

35
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,430
Beat him!

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,390
It's your turn.

37
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,829
Go!

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,940
Get off.

39
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,650
I'm so nervous.

40
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,740
Hurry.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,170
-Get off.
-Okay.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,130
-Let go of the girl.
-Let go!

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,640
Let go!

44
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,430
Let go!

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,860
Let go!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,820
Let go of that girl!

47
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,210
Let go!

48
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Come here.

49
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,810
Keke, don't be afraid.

50
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,460
I'll protect you.

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,370
Come on.

52
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,050
Come on.

53
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,330
Come on.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,050
Wait.

55
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,190
-I'm sorry, Keke.
-What are you doing here?

56
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,159
It's not what you think.

57
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,820
Keke, it's not what you think.

58
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,890
Didn't I tell you?

59
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,820
Isn't that the reaction

60
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,280
you're supposed to have at the beginning...

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,420
Did Keke ask Haikuo out

62
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,440
to break up with him?

63
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,940
I wonder how they are doing.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,730
Elly is so unloyal.

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,780
She promised to go shopping with me,

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,970
but she stood me up.

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,300
Don't be mad.

68
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,950
The business is so good here.

69
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,620
Isn't that Chen Shi from the Business Department?

70
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,390
Hi, Chen Shi.

71
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,460
Do you mind if we sit with you?

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,170
Sit.

73
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,480
This time it's not Wagyu beef,

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
so you won't compete with me, right?

75
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,090
Why do you hold grudges so much?

76
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,550
Who are you talking about?

77
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,550
Don't be angry.

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,390
Yu Fen, let's order.

79
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,940
You deserve to get burned.

80
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,700
Do you want some beef?

81
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,330
Elly, come out.

82
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,680
Hey!

83
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,970
Did you get the money?

84
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

85
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
What money?

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,930
I don't know them.

87
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,250
You fought for nothing.

88
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,650
I know you are in cahoots.

89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,690
If you didn't meet your KPI,

90
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,760
the employer doesn't have to pay you.

91
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,210
I didn't hire you.

92
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,580
It was the girl in the car who hired you.

93
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,480
Go talk to her.

94
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,610
Hey.

95
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,780
Even if it didn't succeed,

96
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,440
we should still get paid.

97
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,580
Let's call it a day.

98
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,150
Miss, come out.

99
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,400
What do you want?

100
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,360
I'm acting in good faith.

101
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,460
I want to test

102
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,860
whether your relationship is firm enough.

103
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,440
No need to test.

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,730
Jian Keke and I have already broken up.

105
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,950
How could you break up so soon?

106
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,180
Stop lying.

107
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,060
Thank you.

108
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,670
Is your nose okay?

109
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,740
It's not hurting anymore.

110
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,070
But it's still running.

111
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,070
What about you? Did you get hurt?

112
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,210
I got hit a few times,

113
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,950
but I'm fine.

114
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,420
Go back and rest.

115
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,320
Bye.

116
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,970
Be careful riding.

117
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,650
He's really a nice guy.

118
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,950
Straightforward and decisive.

119
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,470
But his way of spending money

120
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,180
just doesn't work.

121
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,550
What a pity.

122
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,620
Otherwise, I might consider him.

123
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,750
Hey, what's up, Jiali?

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,260
You're at the police station?

125
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,100
Geez, the drunk person is really heavy.

126
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,650
Get him up there.

127
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,150
Pull him up a little.

128
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,700
Move up.

129
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,290
Drunk people are so heavy.

130
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,180
My hands were shaking just now.

131
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,970
How did he get so drunk?

132
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,040
Yeah. How much did he drink?

133
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,470
Actually, not much.

134
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,240
Just a bottle of beer.

135
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,220
Just one bottle of beer

136
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,350
and he's this drunk?

137
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,840
Your alcohol tolerance is really bad.

138
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,230
He got drunk and fought,

139
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,690
and was brought to the police station.

140
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,120
This won't do.

141
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,990
Grandma.

142
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,980
He just wanted to stand up for me.

143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,980
He just punched Zhigang.

144
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,760
He punched Zhigang?

145
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,090
Well done!

146
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,520
He's got guts.

147
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,500
I don't support violence,

148
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,760
but I support Grandma.

149
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,000
Grandma is right.

150
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,470
All right, you two can go out.

151
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,180
I'll use hot water to help him clean up

152
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,730
so he can sleep well.

153
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,550
Grandma, it's okay.

154
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,050
We can handle it. You go rest.

155
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,550
-What do you mean, "we"?
-No way.

156
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,820
You two aren't married yet.

157
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,620
-Yeah.
-What?

158
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,490
Get out.

159
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,320
I'll handle it.

160
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,450
Yeah, get out.

161
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,150
Get out.

162
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,140
Get out.

163
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,490
I really have a trauma

164
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,490
from your phone calls.

165
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,190
One moment you're in the hospital,

166
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,660
the next you're at the police station.

167
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,260
How can I not worry about you?

168
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,640
You don't need to worry about me.

169
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,480
And you don't need to fear that I'll be too heartbroken.

170
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,690
I've already decided

171
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
to break up with Zhigang.

172
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,390
What a miracle!

173
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,910
Someone finally came to their senses.

174
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,140
It's the reality that forced me to come to my senses.

175
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,260
Zhigang promised me

176
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,930
that he wouldn’t contact Weishan again.

177
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,690
Then they still met in secret.

178
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,920
Now he's even accusing me of having something with Yuanchong.

179
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,120
The guilty party always blames others.

180
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
I really hope

181
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,880
you and Yuanchong are having something going on.

182
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,440
Well.

183
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,530
Only you can stand a man like Zhigang.

184
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,170
I really admire your tolerance.

185
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,880
You should break up quickly.

186
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,280
It's good for both of you.

187
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,330
And I think this breakup

188
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,210
is thanks to Yuanchong.

189
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,640
What did Yuanchong do?

190
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,430
He has been encouraging me all along.

191
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,170
Look.

192
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,930
I've just met him,

193
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,600
yet he can see my efforts.

194
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,130
Unlike Zhigang, who was dismissive.

195
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,680
Besides,

196
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,700
he said I was gentle

197
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,710
and that my happiness

198
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,850
shouldn't be hindered by Zhigang.

199
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,600
He's right.

200
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,880
It's really a bonus.

201
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,320
Last time when we mistook him for a pervert,

202
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,920
I felt like he might have some feelings for you.

203
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,800
Your expression

204
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
makes it seem like you already knew.

205
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,170
Today at the KTV,

206
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,130
he confessed his feelings.

207
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,810
How did you respond?

208
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,200
At that time, Zhigang and I hadn't broken up yet.

209
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,830
But you've broken up with Zhigang now.

210
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,890
What do you say now?

211
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,500
I've just met him.

212
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,930
Besides,

213
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,280
he's just a colleague.

214
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,100
Let's see.

215
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,800
Let's see then.

216
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,070
Alright.

217
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,020
You have your own pace.

218
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,030
I won't push you.

219
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,930
But I still want to remind you.

220
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,610
If you really like him,

221
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,060
you should be brazen

222
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,620
and brave.

223
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,500
Go after them.

224
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,190
That'll make you happy.

225
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,030
Okay?

226
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,240
Okay.

227
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,030
I really want you to be happy.

228
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,430
I'm serious.

229
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,490
Really serious.

230
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,160
Okay.

231
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,820
Where am I?

232
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Whose clothes

233
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,060
is this?

234
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,710
Are you awake?

235
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,810
Do you know you've been sleeping for a long time?

236
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,000
It's almost noon.

237
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,590
Is this

238
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,820
your home?

239
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,400
Because

240
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,050
I didn't know where you lived,

241
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,050
I thought I'd bring you here.

242
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,190
I couldn't just leave you outside.

243
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
It's almost noon.

244
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,730
Don't you have to work?

245
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,010
I've already taken half a day off.

246
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,030
I wanted to make sure you're okay at least.

247
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,460
And I want to thank you in person.

248
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,140
Thank you for standing up for me yesterday.

249
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:52,980
You

250
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,320
didn't forget everything

251
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,250
just because you got drunk, right?

252
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,850
No.

253
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,560
I remember.

254
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,260
Your boyfriend was with another girl.

255
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,750
He even blamed you.

256
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,420
You were quite different from your usual self

257
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,150
when you were drunk.

258
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,080
Do you remember

259
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,670
you hit him directly yesterday?

260
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,920
It startled me.

261
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,080
I have a bit of memory

262
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,240
about that part.

263
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,410
Then at the KTV,

264
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,410
suddenly you were talking a lot.

265
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,270
Do you remember what you said to me?

266
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,130
I'm not

267
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,920
so clear about that part.

268
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,400
It's okay.

269
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,010
I just found you very funny and cute.

270
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,970
Besides,

271
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080
I thought what you said made a lot of sense.

272
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,180
So I mustered up the courage

273
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,650
to break up with him.

274
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,530
Really?

275
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,340
And we also agreed

276
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,370
not to sue each other

277
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,440
and settled it privately at the police station.

278
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,740
So don't worry.

279
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,600
It's okay.

280
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,150
Thank you.

281
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,330
Your clothes should be dry.

282
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,060
I'll get them for you to change.

283
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:19,830
Jiali.

284
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,390
Thank you for taking care of me last night

285
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,260
and

286
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,980
helping me get changed.

287
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,700
But I didn't change your clothes.

288
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,780
You didn't?

289
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,150
Then who did?

290
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,000
You're awake.

291
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,830
I've never seen someone sleep so long

292
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,520
from just one beer.

293
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,510
But when you were drunk,

294
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,990
you were very well-behaved.

295
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,150
You didn't move around much.

296
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,640
I helped you clean your body,

297
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,540
and when I asked you to raise your hand, you did,

298
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,800
and when I asked you to turn over, you did.

299
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,869
Very obedient.

300
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,290
Clean my body?

301
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,589
Yes.

302
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,160
You got all dirty from fighting

303
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,480
with Zhigang.

304
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,410
To make you sleep well,

305
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,290
I wiped your body

306
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,710
with hot water.

307
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,570
What's wrong?

308
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,510
Did I get completely naked?

309
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,230
Then what?

310
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,410
How was I supposed to wipe your body if you were not naked?

311
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,550
Then wouldn't I be seen naked?

312
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,560
[Balance: 100,000 NTD Note: Repayment, Confirmation of Sale]

313
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,240
Manager!

314
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,970
Manager!

315
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,820
Manager.

316
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,790
I kept calling you but you didn't reply.

317
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,120
What were you thinking?

318
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,030
I was thinking

319
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,760
I haven't had coffee today.

320
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,490
Do you want some?

321
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,270
It's on me.

322
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:28,960
Sure.

323
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,860
Uncle, I'm here to pick up

324
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
the packages for the Trendee Accounting Department.

325
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,680
[Heard they broke up. Jian Keke is the third party]

326
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,680
[It seems Keke actively seduced Haikuo and got involved in his life]

327
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,060
Thank you.

328
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,910
[She seems to be pregnant. Getting pregnant while being a third party?]

329
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,910
[Who is the father of the child? How can they break up while being pregnant?]

330
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,350
Actually, she's not the third party, she's the fourth.

331
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,250
But that's not what I heard.

332
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,350
I remember it was the girl who cheated.

333
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,120
There's a lover involved.

334
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,960
You know what? Let me tell you.

335
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,160
The reason for their breakup is simple.

336
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,690
Keke doesn't look pregnant.

337
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,830
Look.

338
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,320
Someone wrote here that

339
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,580
she got rid of the baby.

340
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,480
I didn't get rid of the baby.

341
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,510
So...

342
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,290
Are you pregnant?

343
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,840
I'll only say it once.

344
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:46,950
I...

345
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,380
Am...

346
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,790
Not...

347
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,160
Preg...

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,610
Nant.

349
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,240
What?

350
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,230
It's blood!

351
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,260
Blood.

352
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,240
What blood?

353
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,280
Here!

354
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,410
What should we do?

355
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,320
The tissues.

356
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,090
What should we do?

357
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,050
Keke.

358
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,410
Keke.

359
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,390
Keke.

360
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,480
What?

361
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,220
Why are you yelling?

362
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,390
Where is Keke?

363
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,530
She's resting in the room.

364
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,110
She was doing fine at work.

365
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,910
Why was she sent to the hospital?

366
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,150
I don't know.

367
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,860
She suddenly had a nosebleed.

368
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,780
And she couldn't stop it.

369
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,700
There was blood all over the floor.

370
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,850
What did the doctor say?

371
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,110
The doctor said it's possible...

372
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,650
Keke.

373
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,260
Keke.

374
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,140
Sweetie.

375
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,470
Sweetie. Don't cry.

376
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't be sad.

377
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,400
Daddy will always be with you.

378
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,640
Why does heaven have to treat me like this?

379
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,050
You're still young.

380
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,340
How could this happen?

381
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,060
I finally made it this far.

382
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,040
And now it's all in vain.

383
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,400
Alright.

384
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,420
Heavens.

385
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,090
Don't torture my daughter like this.

386
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,250
If there's any suffering,

387
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,750
direct it at me.

388
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,820
Direct it at me, please.

389
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,630
Please! I beg you!

390
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,620
Shut up!

391
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,700
Are you done?

392
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,030
I've got goosebumps.

393
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,810
Honey.

394
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,660
How can you be so calm?

395
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,300
Keke has cancer.

396
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't have cancer.

397
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,330
Keke, you...

398
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,170
I'm your dad.

399
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,400
I know your filial piety.

400
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,270
Although I'm old,

401
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,270
I may not be able to handle the shock,

402
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,790
or I might have a heart attack

403
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,590
and pass away.

404
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,500
But

405
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,570
you can't...

406
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,050
What are you talking about?

407
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,630
It hurts.

408
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,170
Your daughter doesn't have cancer.

409
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,110
Her nasal membrane got injured earlier.

410
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,810
She had a nosebleed

411
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,730
because she got emotional at work.

412
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,880
Do you understand?

413
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,270
Why were you crying so sadly just now?

414
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,730
Because today is the 29th.

415
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,650
So... So what?

416
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,760
It's the second-to-last day of the month,

417
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,740
and I took sick leave today.

418
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,470
I lost my perfect attendance bonus.

419
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,770
She actually got a nosebleed right there on the spot!

420
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,100
Keke was so emotional.

421
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
Could it be that she was cheated on?

422
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,110
Don't talk nonsense.

423
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,430
Mr. Wang is not that kind of person.

424
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,330
Also,

425
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,860
try not to mention Keke

426
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,030
in front of Mr. Wang.

427
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,690
Why?

428
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,120
Because he's been in a bad mood lately.

429
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,050
Don't make him feel even more down.

430
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,300
If he's so upset,

431
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,100
why did they break up then?

432
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,160
Yeah, why?

433
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,060
Yeah.

434
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,580
And that even caused Keke to have a big nosebleed.

435
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,280
He's here.

436
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,270
The company's annual health checkup is coming up again.

437
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,070
If there are any issues with the body,

438
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,340
they can be identified right away.

439
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,180
That's right.

440
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,630
Our company really cares about us employees

441
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,170
by organizing this every year.

442
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,410
The company is really great.

443
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,730
Such a good company.

444
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,030
Mr. Wang.

445
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,040
Sort it out.

446
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,290
Okay.

447
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,270
Tell us. Why?

448
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,870
Stop gossiping.

449
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,100
Just do your work.

450
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,050
I'll take it.

451
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,480
No, I can do it.

452
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,830
Can you?

453
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,120
Come on.

454
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,260
You didn't even notice when something was wrong

455
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,350
with your own body.

456
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,910
I remember your company provides

457
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,490
free annual health checkups, right?

458
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,450
Yes.

459
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,490
I do it every year.

460
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,710
After all, it's free.

461
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,780
You should also get the self-paid items checked.

462
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,110
But they are expensive.

463
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,360
I know you're thinking of

464
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,550
saving money for the family.

465
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,360
But you should save on

466
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,960
unnecessary expenses.

467
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,120
How can you skimp on health expenses?

468
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,760
Okay, I got it.

469
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,970
Don't worry.

470
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,850
If

471
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,420
you don't want your parents to worry,

472
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,450
then get a thorough check-up

473
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,260
from head to toe.

474
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,340
Only if your body is healthy

475
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,100
will your parents feel at ease.

476
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,070
Understand?

477
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,240
Alright, I'll do all the examinations this year,

478
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,410
no matter how much it costs.

479
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,600
I'll get checked from head to toe.

480
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,130
Okay.

481
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,270
That's my good daughter.

482
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,090
Be careful.

484
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,030
Thank you.

485
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,480
You get changed first. I'll come in later.

486
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,030
The manager asked you to cover a shift again?

487
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,850
I saw that it wasn't your shift on the original schedule.

488
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,840
Jing asked for leave for something urgent.

489
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,970
happened to be free.

490
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,310
By the way,

491
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,590
this is for you.

492
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,360
I made this at the bakery.

493
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,460
I save this especially for you.

494
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,180
Thank you.

495
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,980
I'll go restock the shelves first.

496
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,210
Eat it when you have a chance.

497
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,910
Okay.

498
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,340
This is for you.

499
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,520
I made this at the bakery.

500
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,680
I save this especially for you.

501
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,400
Why is she

502
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,910
being so nice to me?

503
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,840
You act very differently

504
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,900
when you're drunk compared to usual.

505
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,030
You suddenly became super talkative.

506
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,550
Do you remember what you said to me?

507
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,730
Since Jiali is single now,

508
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,550
does that mean I have a chance?

509
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:44,730
Jiali.

510
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,310
It's late.

511
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,620
Let me take you home.

512
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,310
It's okay.

513
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,920
There are still buses.

514
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,010
It's still quite a distance from here to the bus stop.

515
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,660
It's dangerous for you to go alone.

516
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,860
Let me accompany you.

517
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,740
Alright then.

518
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,410
Thank you.

519
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,650
Do you still remember what you said

520
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,660
at the karaoke?

521
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,460
Actually, I was really touched at that time.

522
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,070
Because sometimes I feel like

523
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,750
I'm not a very likable person.

524
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,610
Not at all.

525
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,590
Although you don't talk much,

526
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,910
I think you are a warm person.

527
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,150
You're the first one to say I'm warm.

528
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,720
Maybe it's because you usually

529
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,170
have a cool demeanor.

530
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,820
So smile more

531
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,460
and be enthusiastic like when you're drunk.

532
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,490
I believe many people will like you.

533
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,000
What about you then?

534
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,370
I just broke up with Zhigang.

535
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,160
It'd be a lie to say I'm not sad.

536
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,070
And I think

537
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,540
I'm not ready

538
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,170
to start a new relationship.

539
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,060
I can wait.

540
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,980
I don't think you should waste your time

541
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,920
on me.

542
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:24,860
But

543
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,620
you gave me a cake today.

544
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,140
Isn't that because you have

545
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,480
at least a little bit of feelings for me?

546
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,440
I do like you a lot.

547
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,290
When we are together,

548
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,310
you feel like a little brother to me.

549
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,440
Little brother?

550
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,570
You're a cute little brother.

551
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,990
Cute little brother.

552
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,850
[Trendee][Accounting Department]

553
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,860
They really broke up.

554
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,340
The atmosphere in the Business Department is down

555
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,530
because Haikuo is in a very bad mood.

556
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,330
Last time, because of rumors from other colleagues,

557
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,990
Keke even lashed out at us.

558
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,470
Not only that,

559
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,890
she even had a nosebleed.

560
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,710
Look how upset Keke is.

561
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,910
she's even sick.

562
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,430
80% of the rumors in the company

563
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,870
are false.

564
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,360
Why do you just refuse to believe

565
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,760
that they have broken up?

566
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,610
Because based on Haikuo's attitude towards me...

567
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,920
[Division One]

568
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,970
I heard you signed another order.

569
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,750
Congratulations.

570
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,020
It hurts so much.

571
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,120
It hurts.

572
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,490
Wearing high heels for too long

573
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,620
is bad for your ankles.

574
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,010
He just walked out like that.

575
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,690
Haikuo is so cold

576
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,739
to people he's not interested in.

577
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,130
But,

578
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,080
just because he's not interested in you,

579
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,300
you assume they haven't broken up?

580
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,389
Otherwise, how could he possibly

581
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,460
have no interest at all

582
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,060
in a stunning beauty like me?

583
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,429
Stunning beauty...

584
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,679
So we must find a way

585
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,530
to get them together

586
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,620
to figure out the truth.

587
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,219
How are you going to

588
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,320
get them together?

589
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,860
Isn't the company health checkup

590
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,639
starting soon?

591
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,440
Yes.

592
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,730
So?

593
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,130
[Health Screening Center]

594
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,240
Thank you.

595
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,820
Where is Keke?

596
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,950
She wouldn't skip it today, right?

597
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,870
No way.

598
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,720
She wouldn't miss out on

599
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,250
something free like this.

600
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,040
What about Haikuo?

601
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,080
Haven't seen him either.

602
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,800
They're here.

603
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,100
See, they haven't broken up.

604
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,360
Please fill out the forms here.

605
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,680
Maybe they just took the same elevator.

606
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,840
Look, Michael Zhao is here too.

607
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,320
Those who have filled out the forms,

608
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,880
please come over here to change clothes.

609
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,680
-Okay.
-Okay.

610
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,690
It took a long time.

611
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,290
You know?

612
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,460
Besides the gastroscopy, colonoscopy,

613
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,220
and abdominal ultrasound,

614
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,250
what other tests did you add?

615
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,160
Tell me.

616
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,330
Why are you asking me about this?

617
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,690
It's your body. I'm worried.

618
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,690
I'm professional in health maintenance.

619
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,160
Tell me and I'll evaluate it for you.

620
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,590
CT scan of the lungs,

621
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,580
and coronary artery examination of the heart.

622
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,560
Can you be quiet

623
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
for just five minutes?

624
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,420
Just five minutes. Thank you.

625
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,120
No.

626
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,350
No, about scalp care...

627
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,280
-Michael Zhao.
-I'm good at it too.

628
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,060
If you come every month,

629
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,240
I'll draw some of your blood.

630
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,160
You know that blood tests

631
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,570
are very good for the body.

632
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,180
Mr. Wang.

633
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,630
You're being so cold to Keke.

634
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,100
Are you really giving up?

635
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,440
Did you add any self-paid items?

636
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,680
No.

637
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,620
Did you?

638
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,700
Yes.

639
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,180
What did you add?

640
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,350
CT scan of the lungs,

641
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,270
brain ultrasound,

642
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,850
colonoscopy, gastroscopy,

643
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,710
and coronary artery of the heart.

644
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,590
You also added these?

645
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:39,950
So...

646
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,350
Or do you need to regulate female hormones?

647
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,160
Everyone praises it after getting it drawn.

648
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,670
Why do you look so happy?

649
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,020
It's good to draw blood.

650
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,510
It promotes metabolism.

651
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,590
Old blood goes out

652
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,190
so new blood can be produced.

653
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,050
After drawing blood, you feel more energized.

654
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,680
You're drawing that many tubes?

655
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,660
Of course.

656
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
I added all the

657
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,680
self-paid blood tests.

658
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,170
Sir, make a tight fist.

659
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,110
Okay.

660
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,000
Why are you doing elderly exercises here?

661
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,570
It's not elderly exercises!

662
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,660
The nurse couldn't find a vein

663
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,860
and told me to do this.

664
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,360
My nails!

665
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,490
Why did you hit me?

666
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,370
This way the veins will surface.

667
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,910
Be gentle.

668
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,350
I just have my nails done.

669
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,170
[Urine Sample Collection]

670
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,900
Miss.

671
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,800
Your blood pressure is a bit high.

672
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,260
For this health checkup,

673
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,040
I haven't eaten anything since last night.

674
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,300
Finally, I can eat to my heart's content!

675
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,520
Where's Keke?

676
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,710
Over there.

677
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,330
Mr. Wang, let's sit here.

678
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,010
You can sit here.

679
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,550
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

680
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,350
No.

681
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,010
Such a direct rejection.

682
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,800
See, I told you.

683
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,350
They've already broken up.

684
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,310
Keke is so cute.

685
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,250
You even created an opportunity

686
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,890
and left a seat for me

687
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,090
so that we can have breakfast together.

688
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,620
And you picked

689
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,690
a table right in the middle of the room,

690
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,550
-to let everyone know.
-I'm full.

691
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,590
Where are you going?

692
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,900
So shy.

693
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,700
I'm back.

694
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,930
You're back.

695
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,390
Keke, I have good news for you.

696
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,360
Our family is going to be rich.

697
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,660
Our luck is turning around.

698
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,430
See?

699
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,850
A 500-NT-dollar coupon.

700
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,920
Your mom's plump hand

701
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,190
drew the grand prize on the first try.

702
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,410
I'm a lucky woman.

703
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,340
Yes.

704
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,420
Congratulations.

705
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,420
Darling.

706
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,570
What happened?

707
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,480
Is it your...

708
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,810
your health report today?

709
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,330
The health checkup report

710
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,180
won't come out until next week.

711
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,430
You scared me.

712
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,520
Then it's nothing.

713
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,590
There is something.

714
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,160
Have you ever had the experience

715
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,970
of rejecting someone who likes you

716
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,660
but still wanting to be friends with them?

717
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,150
Of course.

718
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,530
The problem is

719
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,160
that deep down in your heart,

720
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,570
you still have a tiny bit of feelings

721
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,010
for this person.

722
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,690
Then, after spending some time together

723
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,070
and getting to know each other better,

724
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,470
it still turns into love.

725
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,980
I knew it.

726
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,560
You still can't forget about Wanting.

727
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,430
You said you don't like her.

728
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460
But in your heart,

729
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,080
you care a lot.

730
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,280
Who is Wanting?

731
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,390
Please.

732
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,510
When I was in college,

733
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,730
I joined a club.

734
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,080
There was a

735
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,150
junior girl,

736
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,760
who majored in...

737
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,010
You still remember it so clearly.

738
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,060
I...

739
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,080
I...

740
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,360
Honey, I...

741
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,820
I don't have dementia.

742
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,000
Now.

743
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,310
I

744
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,140
don't want to see you.

745
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,940
Okay, I'll take out the trash now.

746
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,650
That jerk.

747
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,260
It's been over 30 years.

748
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,410
You're still upset?

749
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,820
You're one to talk.

750
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,300
What about you?

751
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,170
You're in a bad mood.

752
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,230
Is it related to

753
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,150
Haikuo?

754
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,990
How can you know?

755
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,990
Whose daughter are you?

756
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,110
Mine!

757
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,590
I can read your mind.

758
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,120
You don't have any male friends,

759
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,410
except for Haikuo.

760
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,840
Of course it's like this.

761
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,600
He was very cold to me

762
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,510
during today's health checkup.

763
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,240
I already took the initiative to be nice to him,

764
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,280
but he ignored me.

765
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,450
Then it means

766
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,120
he still really likes you.

767
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,090
After you rejected him,

768
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,470
he doesn't know how to face you.

769
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,980
Is that so?

770
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:12,670
Yes.

771
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,460
I thought he was a nice guy

772
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,320
and wanted to be friends with him.

773
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,600
What a pity.

774
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,950
If you think it's a pity,

775
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,370
then you should take more initiative.

776
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,060
I did take the initiative,

777
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,120
but he just ignored me.

778
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,110
If I'm even more proactive,

779
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,600
it'll be weird.

780
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,290
Jian Keke.

781
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,260
In one's life,

782
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,290
you must never do anything

783
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,490
that you'll regret or feel remorse for.

784
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,300
If you

785
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,810
sincerely want to be friends with Haikuo,

786
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,960
just do as I say.

787
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,220
Try it.

788
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,770
There's always a chance.

789
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,600
Right?

790
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:50,520
Right?

791
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,550
Right?

792
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,430
Look.

793
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,380
Aren't these French nails I did

794
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,350
pretty good?

795
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,320
You used correction fluid?

796
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,820
Yes. Look.

797
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,680
It saves money.

798
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,730
It won't be toxic, right?

799
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:03,930
No.

800
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,770
So pretty.

801
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,660
Keke was not dating Haikuo.

802
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,680
But my feelings for Haikuo are real.

803
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,670
The best way to heal from heartbreak is

804
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,200
is to start a relationship.

805
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,920
I do hope he can move on quickly.

806
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,690
So if you want him to like you,

807
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,520
you can take advantage of his stomach issues.

808
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,920
He has stomach problems?

809
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,460
He has a stomach condition?

810
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,060
[Preview]

811
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,690
This is the fish soup I cooked for you.

812
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,890
It's better to drink something hot in the morning.

813
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,550
You broke up with Haikuo,

814
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,850
but you are still pestering him.

815
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,470
[Trendee]

816
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,730
But we're still good colleagues and friends.

817
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:44,910
Can't we?

818
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,270
I'll do my best.

819
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:48,860
Mr. Wang.

820
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,660
You're in debt.

821
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,920
From the moment a person is born,

822
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,180
they start owing debts.

823
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,020
It's obvious his attempt to get back together isn't sincere.

824
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,480
Don't give him another chance.

825
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,880
Don't meddle in

826
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,380
my business with Zhigang.

827
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,210
I think your love is growing deeper.

828
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:00,940
Is this love?

829
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,240
I'm looking forward to it.

830
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,750
You're going to stay at my home?

831
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,640
Is that okay?
