[Episode 22]

4
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,990
Congratulations.

5
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,460
May you grow old together.

6
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,130
-Thank you.
-Sorry for any inconvenience.

7
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,970
Master, Madam.

8
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,740
May you have a baby soon.

9
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,070
Have a seat.

10
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,420
Thank you.

11
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,220
Thank you.

12
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,810
Wait.

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,380
You only say thank you?

14
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,170
Otherwise,

15
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,180
how about wishing you prosperity

16
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,910
and living happily ever after?

17
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,340
Thank you.

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,020
We will not just live happily ever after.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,220
We want to be together forever and ever,

20
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,590
in every lifetime.

21
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,050
This is

22
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,640
mine and Elly’s

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
favorite vegetarian dish.

24
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,100
It's nutritious and tasty.

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,790
We're now sharing it with everyone.

26
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,470
Eating it

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,229
will make you

28
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,020
as handsome

29
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,950
and beautiful as we are.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,400
When a boy eats it,

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,880
he will quickly

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,900
find

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,000
his

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,290
true

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,300
love.

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,530
When a girl eats it,

37
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,930
she will soon find her true love, too.

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,290
Love

39
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,750
is truly terrifying.

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,650
It can make the already abnormal people

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,680
even

42
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,670
more abnormal.

43
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,120
They're so high-profile.

44
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,340
Won't it be awkward

45
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,670
if they break up?

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,940
It will.

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,170
Eat.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,160
Eat more.

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,050
Thank you.

50
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,290
Wishing you mutual love, all your dreams come true,

51
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,080
a long-lasting union, and everlasting love.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,600
Thank you.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,590
Thank you.

54
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,350
Where are you going?

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm going to save the company.

56
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,430
Have you heard too?

57
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,210
Haikuo and Keke have already broken up.

58
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,890
It hasn’t even been three months.

59
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,620
Looks like I was too optimistic

60
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,770
betting on them lasting six months.

61
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,190
Isn't it just a rumor?

62
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,560
It's not confirmed yet.

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,690
I think it's almost certain.

64
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,340
Haikuo has already resigned.

65
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,340
They no longer have a shared circle.

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,970
And with their incompatible personalities,

67
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,220
breaking up was just a matter of time.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,930
-Over.
-Over.

69
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,190
All right.

70
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,690
Stop gossiping behind their backs.

71
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,470
Eat up.

72
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,750
Isn't she the one

73
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,490
who loves to gossip the most?

74
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,950
She's usually the one who starts it.

75
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,270
I'm your puppy.

76
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,500
-Over.
-Over.

77
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,130
Hello.

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,570
I’m here to see President Wang of TV Group.

79
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,850
Do you have an appointment?

80
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,660
No.

81
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,810
Can you tell him

82
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,370
I'm Jian Keke from Trendee?

83
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,940
Okay, wait a moment.

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,160
Hello?

85
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,340
Yes.

86
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,300
She says her name is Jian Keke.

87
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,409
Sorry.

88
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,650
Our secretary says he doesn’t know you.

89
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,220
Can you tell him

90
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,450
I'm a friend of President Wang’s son?

91
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,560
Okay, please wait a moment.

92
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,300
She says she's a friend of the President Wang's son.

93
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,950
Got it.

94
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,020
Our secretary says

95
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,150
he knows who you are,

96
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,580
but he doesn’t want to see you right now.

97
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,910
Okay.

98
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,390
Can you tell him

99
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,010
that I'll be waiting here?

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,050
-Thank you.
-Okay.

101
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,020
Bro.

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,560
I know giving you this breakfast

103
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,210
is a very cruel thing to do.

104
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,030
But as your good brother and friend,

105
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,260
I have to share this joy with you.

106
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,770
I'm really torn.

107
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,659
Don't think too much about it.

108
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:40,020
Seeing you and Elly so in love,

109
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm really happy for you.

110
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,080
You don’t feel any

111
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,450
discomfort,

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,270
unhappiness,

113
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,030
anger,

114
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,020
or frustration at all?

115
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,180
Not at all.

116
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,280
Then I'm relieved.

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,630
I was worried I might upset you.

118
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,660
Before coming,

119
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,760
I reminded myself

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,090
not to mention Keke.

121
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,720
By the way, speaking of Keke,

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,460
she also received

123
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,800
an identical breakfast.

124
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,660
She accepted it

125
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,040
just as straightforwardly as you did.

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,760
She didn't mind at all,

127
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,860
just like you.

128
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,350
She didn't care,

129
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,600
just like you.

130
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,830
It seemed like the breakup

131
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,280
didn't affect her at all.

132
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,460
I heard

133
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,350
the general manager personally met with Keke.

134
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,850
Since breaking up with you,

135
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,640
her career has really taken off.

136
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,580
That's great.

137
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,810
Alright, enough talking.

138
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,420
Here.

139
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,670
Eating this sweet breakfast

140
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,830
will fill your

141
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,480
lonely, empty heart.

142
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,490
Keke ate it too.

143
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,180
Haven't you

144
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,120
been out for a while?

145
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,040
You're right.

146
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,890
I should go back and have lunch with Elly.

147
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,610
I won't bother you anymore.

148
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,870
Remember to eat it all.

149
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,760
Bro.

150
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,160
Why do I feel you look pale?

151
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,120
Come have a sweet lunch

152
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
with Elly and me.

153
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,330
Maybe it will spark

154
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,790
your desire for love.

155
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,920
I really don't need it.

156
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,300
You really need it.

157
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,520
Come on.

158
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
-Come on. Get up.
-No need.

159
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,420
Come on.

160
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,890
Come on.

161
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,360
Really. Come...

162
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,460
I told you

163
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,320
I don't need...

164
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,630
You're home.

165
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,100
Are you free?

166
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,600
I want to talk to you.

167
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,440
Why are you standing there?

168
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,390
Come, sit down.

169
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,940
Relax.

170
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,000
I’m not going to scold you.

171
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm not here

172
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,669
to blame you

173
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,270
for anything about Keke.

174
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,770
What happened between you and Keke

175
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,270
is your business.

176
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,030
As her father,

177
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,110
I don't have the right to interfere.

178
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,170
That's you, the young people’s matter.

179
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,790
So,

180
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,600
why did you want to talk to me, Uncle Jian?

181
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,760
See?

182
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,490
This open space

183
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,320
is where I taught Keke

184
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,560
to ride a bike when she was little.

185
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,240
You know my Keke.

186
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,310
She has her own ideas.

187
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,400
As a result,

188
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,940
she kept falling,

189
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,980
bleeding,

190
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,060
and crying.

191
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
But she kept practicing

192
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,190
despite the tears.

193
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,800
As her father,

194
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,040
I didn’t want to see her get hurt

195
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,810
or cry.

196
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,560
I thought

197
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,690
it would be better if she didn't learn to ride.

198
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,230
So what if she couldn't ride?

199
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,070
I can ride.

200
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,610
Wherever she wants to go,

201
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,320
I can take her.

202
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,390
This is actually

203
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,860
a selfish thought of mine

204
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,270
as a father.

205
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,880
The issues

206
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,450
between parents and children

207
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,980
have been a difficult puzzle

208
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,630
for thousands of years.

209
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,510
Every era

210
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,840
has its own unique problems.

211
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,590
But one thing is certain, which is

212
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,080
that the love of parents for their children

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,670
is eternal.

214
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,290
Uncle Jian, you mean...

215
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,430
I'm not familiar with your father.

216
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
But I believe

217
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,950
his love for you

218
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,480
is the same as that

219
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,650
of every father.

220
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,670
It's just

221
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,450
that you're trapped

222
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,310
by your own resentment.

223
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,430
I know you don't hate him.

224
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,590
You are dissatisfied with him.

225
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,130
He wasn't by your side

226
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,330
when you needed him the most.

227
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,390
But you also have to understand him.

228
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,350
As a new father,

229
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,860
there were many things

230
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,350
he needed to learn too.

231
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,090
Besides,

232
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,230
he had a big business to run,

233
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,990
and he had his own troubles.

234
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,660
I know

235
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,350
you're afraid

236
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,330
of breaking down,

237
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,830
crying,

238
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,600
and showing your vulnerability in front of him.

239
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,380
So

240
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,620
you deliberately kept a distance from him,

241
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,480
not letting him get close.

242
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,830
You also don't want to approach him.

243
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,050
But have you ever thought

244
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,050
that continuing this way

245
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,800
will only bring you more pain?

246
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,690
Take my advice.

247
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,170
Find a time

248
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,060
to have a good talk with him.

249
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Is she still here?

250
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,810
Yes, she's still in the lobby.

251
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,950
Fortunately, there's Elly's breakfast.

252
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,350
Otherwise, I would really starve to death.

253
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,110
Thank you both.

254
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,030
You look quite cute.

255
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,250
I didn't know that the president

256
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,200
works so late.

257
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,830
It's too hard.

258
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,850
Or is it because he knows I'm waiting here?

259
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,320
He's not that scheming.

260
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,790
That's ridiculous.

261
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,060
You're just dazed from waiting too long,

262
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,890
so you started talking to yourself?

263
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,020
I've really been waiting for quite...

264
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,470
President Wang.

265
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,090
Go buy some simple meals.

266
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,640
Yes.

267
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,200
Do you want to eat first or talk first?

268
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,990
I suggest eating first.

269
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,760
If he finds out

270
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,800
I let his girlfriend go hungry,

271
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,500
he will hate me even more.

272
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,130
Haikuo and I have already broken up.

273
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,690
Is it because of me?

274
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,600
Because all this time,

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,890
you've always been a burden to him.

276
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,190
Since you've already broken up with Haikuo,

277
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,070
why are you still coming to me?

278
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,520
Even though we broke up,

279
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,160
I still care about him.

280
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,750
I told you before

281
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,270
that I hope you won't hurt Haikuo again.

282
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,320
But why did you come to our general manager

283
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,920
to provoke him and force him?

284
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,830
I wanted to help with his performance.

285
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,960
Haikuo obviously doesn't want to

286
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,160
have any involvement with you anymore.

287
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,190
Why do you still want to trouble him?

288
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,250
I really don't understand

289
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,540
how a father

290
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,590
wanting to have more contact with his child,

291
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,190
actively showing goodwill,

292
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,630
is

293
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,750
hurting him

294
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,460
and causing him trouble.

295
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,610
I suppose you must have heard

296
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,600
about what happened back then from Haikuo,

297
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,860
which is why you are so unforgiving to me.

298
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,520
But from my standpoint back then,

299
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,910
I don't think

300
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,170
I was wrong.

301
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,610
You actually sold the company's shares!

302
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,090
That's my asset.

303
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,490
I'll sell it if I want to.

304
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,480
What business is it of yours?

305
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,010
You could sell it to anyone,

306
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,230
but you sold it to our competitors.

307
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,840
What were you thinking?

308
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,990
Even if I have to cooperate with our enemies,

309
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,560
I will bring you down.

310
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,260
Wait and see.

311
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,120
When she was sick,

312
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,720
it was the most stressful time for me.

313
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,790
If our shares don't exceed half,

314
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,070
we have no say in the company.

315
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,740
I had to ask shareholders everywhere

316
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,470
to keep the company's control,

317
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,670
so my father's lifetime effort

318
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,230
wouldn't go to waste.

319
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,820
What did the doctor say?

320
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,920
For now, after surgery,

321
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,500
she will need six chemotherapy sessions.

322
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,560
Can it be cured?

323
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,790
If the cancer cells don't spread,

324
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,920
the survival rate of five years is 60%.

325
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,890
President Wang.

326
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,280
Jack texted, saying he could talk now.

327
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,530
Let's schedule it for tomorrow.

328
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,100
He's flying to London early tomorrow morning.

329
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,360
The shareholders' meeting is next week.

330
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,930
He's our company's third-largest shareholder.

331
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,660
If we cooperate with him,

332
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,920
our shares will definitely exceed half.

333
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,640
Tell Jack

334
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,030
I'm going to meet him now.

335
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,670
Yes.

336
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,210
If you ask me if I regret it,

337
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,310
I do.

338
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,720
I deeply regret it.

339
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,520
Because I didn't expect the cancer cells to spread,

340
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,560
and Yueqin would pass away

341
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,010
so quickly.

342
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,470
But I worked so hard in my career

343
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,790
out of selfishness.

344
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,220
As a husband and a father,

345
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,890
I wanted to give my wife and child

346
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,950
the most stable and prosperous life.

347
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,260
Was I wrong to do that?

348
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,470
Keke.

349
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,040
You're still young.

350
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,680
Many things have two sides.

351
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,880
You said Haikuo dislikes me

352
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
and even hated me.

353
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,190
But if he didn't

354
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,630
care about me so much,

355
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,750
why would he hate me so much?

356
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,510
It's late.

357
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,240
I'll ask my secretary to send you home.

358
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,960
I know you don't hate him.

359
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,680
You are dissatisfied with him.

360
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,830
He wasn't by your side

361
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,820
when you needed him the most.

362
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,020
But have you ever thought

363
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,350
that continuing this way

364
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,050
will only bring you more pain?

365
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,100
I deeply regret it.

366
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,200
Because I didn't expect the cancer cells to spread.

367
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,060
But I worked so hard in my career

368
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,450
out of selfishness.

369
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,440
As a husband and a father,

370
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,500
I wanted to give my wife and child

371
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,560
the most stable and prosperous life.

372
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,020
Was I wrong to do that?

373
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,640
Mi.

374
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,770
What's up?

375
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,020
I can't find your clothes.

376
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,280
Which one?

377
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,250
The outfit you planned to wear

378
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,890
when you were going to pursue Keke again.

379
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,420
It's very smart and proper.

380
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,190
The dessert shop opens today.

381
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,650
If you wear that outfit,

382
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,110
you'll definitely shine.

383
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,360
Baby.

384
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,010
I exchanged it.

385
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,760
We are truly a perfect match.

386
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,270
I love changing bags.

387
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,830
You love changing clothes.

388
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,030
Baby.

389
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,110
When I said I switched clothes,

390
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,090
I meant it literally.

391
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,720
I always keep a certain number

392
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,600
of clothes in my wardrobe.

393
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Every season,

394
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,100
I exchange the ones I don't want or am tired of

395
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,570
with people online.

396
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,070
This way, it's economical, diverse,

397
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,100
and eco-friendly.

398
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,170
Isn't that great?

399
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,050
There's actually such a website?

400
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,630
Yes.

401
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,290
From now on,

402
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,650
I want to exchange clothes

403
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,270
with others like you do.

404
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,080
I said

405
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,500
I want to work hard with you to buy a house.

406
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:07,990
Baby.

407
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,810
You are willing

408
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,340
to sacrifice the fun of buying clothes for me?

409
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,680
It's not a sacrifice.

410
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,640
It's following my husband's lead.

411
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,650
No way.

412
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,920
"Following my husband's lead"

413
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,350
is such a touching phrase.

414
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,030
I feel

415
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,810
so happy right now.

416
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,070
No.

417
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,320
No.

418
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,440
I'm so happy right now, baby.

419
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,340
I'm so scared.

420
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,130
What if one day the heavens become jealous

421
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,210
and take away my happiness,

422
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,890
what would I do?

423
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,820
That won't happen.

424
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,360
Our sincerity will move heaven and earth.

425
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,020
As long as we share our happiness

426
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
with others,

427
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,480
there's nothing to fear.

428
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,440
Exactly.

429
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,690
We need to share our happiness

430
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,240
with everyone.

431
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,850
So they can be as happy as we are.

432
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,390
Let's start

433
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,790
with Haikuo

434
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,060
and Keke.

435
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,190
Here. Thank you.

436
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,920
All the bread is freshly baked.

437
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,460
Anything else?

438
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,360
Okay.

439
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,440
This one?

440
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,170
Okay.

441
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,460
All this bread can be put on the shelves.

442
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,090
Okay.

443
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,510
160 NTD.

444
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,730
Where's Auntie Jian?

445
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,750
She told Grandma she was going to the market

446
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,290
and would bring us a hearty lunch.

447
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,130
For this young lady.

448
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,590
-Thank you.
-Let's go to the side to check out.

449
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,330
Thank you.

450
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,170
Uncle Jian.

451
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,360
Jiali. Look.

452
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,170
Business is booming today.

453
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,780
We have a lot of customers.

454
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,970
Good.

455
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,290
Not bad.

456
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,730
Hello, everyone.

457
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,580
Callie's Bakery is having its grand opening today.

458
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,540
Hello, would you like to try some samples?

459
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,380
Sure.

460
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,590
We have blueberry bagels here.

461
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,390
You can try them.

462
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,590
There are many other flavors inside.

463
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,530
-You can try them.
-Okay, thank you.

464
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,340
We're offering a 20% discount on everything.

465
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,070
Yuanchong.

466
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,660
Chen Shi, you're here.

467
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,920
Congratulations on the opening.

468
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,970
These are my colleagues, Yu Fen and Katy.

469
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,760
I brought them along to support you.

470
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,490
Hello.

471
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,050
-Thank you for coming.
-Hi.

472
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,770
By the way,

473
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,550
here are some vouchers.

474
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,960
You can use them to exchange

475
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,750
for bread.

476
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,540
Thank you.

477
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,420
Do you have any recommendations?

478
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,820
All our baker's bread is delicious.

479
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,590
If you can't get enough,

480
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,090
you can take some home.

481
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,750
You're getting better at promoting the products.

482
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,720
There are many flavors inside.

483
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,290
Take your time to choose.

484
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,290
-Thank you.
-Everything is 20% off.

485
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,550
What kind...

486
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,900
What kind of surprise makes us walk so far?

487
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,390
If I tell you, it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

488
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,960
Yeah, be patient.

489
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,290
You've been asking all the way here.

490
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,390
We're almost there.

491
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,530
Handmade bread and cookies.

492
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,340
Everything is 20% off today.

493
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,790
A grand opening!

494
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,390
A grand opening!

495
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,010
20% off...

496
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:09,950
This...

497
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,620
Isn't that voice...

498
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,190
Haikuo?

499
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,140
Follow your heart.

500
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,100
Don't hesitate.

501
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,750
This one?

502
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,680
Okay.

503
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,020
I know this is a bit sudden.

504
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,580
When I

505
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,350
told your parents,

506
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,950
they also thought it was too soon to propose.

507
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,780
It's not about being too soon.

508
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
We just aren't right for each other.

509
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,570
Let's break up.

510
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,050
Follow your heart.

511
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,080
Don't hesitate.

512
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,680
Keke

513
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,400
doesn't love you anymore.

514
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,270
Leaving is the right choice.

515
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,870
There's nothing left to say goodbye to.

516
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,800
It's the best

517
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,010
if we never see each other again.

518
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,160
Haikuo.

519
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,160
It has been a long time.

520
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,770
Yuanchong.

521
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,530
Yes, Mr. Jian?

522
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,110
I'm going out with Jiali.

523
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,230
Look after the shop.

524
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,730
Okay.

525
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,410
Where are you going?

526
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,120
You're back?

527
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,050
Yeah, what's up?

528
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,120
Where's Haikuo?

529
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,810
He left after picking up the bread.

530
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,150
Aren't you two going to get back together?

531
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,790
Today is the opening day of Callie Bakery.

532
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,220
So, what would you like to eat?

533
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,480
Come on, I'll help you.

534
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,330
I'll help you pick.

535
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,090
Come on.

536
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,690
Nobody leaves

537
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,960
without buying something today.

538
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,020
Choose your bread.

539
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,090
You can pick it from here.

540
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,750
Choose your bread.

541
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,210
This one is quite popular.

542
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,030
This one looks delicious.

543
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,980
Croissant.

544
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,530
This one.

545
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,970
And this one.

546
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,310
I like chocolate.

547
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,390
Chocolate?

548
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,520
So,

549
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,040
how's business today?

550
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,050
Good, very good.

551
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,080
Grandma,

552
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,140
we're offering a 20% discount on everything today.

553
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,370
Small profits but quick returns.

554
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,160
After covering costs,

555
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,180
we should have made a decent profit.

556
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,630
So,

557
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,240
you sold a lot of bread today?

558
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,050
Yes.

559
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,910
I sold all the dough I prepared.

560
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,310
-Really?
-I have to get up early tomorrow

561
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,600
to prepare more.

562
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,640
You worked hard

563
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,310
selling so much bread today.

564
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,360
Since you need to leave early tomorrow to prepare.

565
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,360
Go to bed early,

566
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,020
so you'll have more energy.

567
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,480
I'll go to the store early tomorrow to get things ready.

568
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,060
You can sleep in a bit.

569
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,690
Okay.

570
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,990
Good night.

571
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,960
Bye-bye.

572
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,650
Grandma, I'll head out now.

573
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,750
Bye-bye.

574
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,100
Get home and sleep early.

575
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,430
Okay, see you tomorrow.

576
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,450
Bye-bye.

577
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,810
I'm telling you,

578
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,500
Yuan

579
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,090
is reliable.

580
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,000
Look how devoted he is to your shop.

581
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,960
Impressive.

582
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,750
Grandma, you know what?

583
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,630
Not only did he help promote the shop outside the entrance today,

584
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,190
he also went to nearby buildings to distribute flyers

585
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,160
in the afternoon.

586
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,640
Really?

587
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,980
He's very dedicated.

588
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,140
That's great.

589
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,200
Did he forget to change your shoes again?

590
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,010
I'll go check.

591
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,000
Jiali.

592
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,590
Mom.

593
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,250
What are you doing here?

594
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,860
Well...

595
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,440
You again?

596
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,900
We don't welcome you here.

597
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,420
Leave!

598
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,390
Leave now!

599
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,490
Jiali.

600
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,460
I know

601
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,360
I haven't been a good mother

602
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,900
to you,

603
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,420
but I'm desperate,

604
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,350
or I wouldn't be here begging you.

605
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,000
You, stop talking.

606
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,750
Didn't you understand

607
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,840
anything I said before?

608
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,910
Mom!

609
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,530
My husband lost his job.

610
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,970
The money you gave me before

611
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,490
isn't enough for my daughter's overseas education.

612
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,620
If you don't have money, then don't go.

613
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,940
Your daughter?

614
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,830
I...

615
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,420
I know Jiali has her own shop now

616
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,760
and is making money, right?

617
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,590
Jiali, can you lend me

618
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,050
some money?

619
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,890
As a mother,

620
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,620
you only think about your other daughter.

621
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,750
What about this one?

622
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,310
Isn't she your daughter too?

623
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,170
Can't you consider her feelings?

624
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,970
I have considered her.

625
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:04,960
Jiali.

626
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,050
I'll pay you back

627
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:06,910
the money I borrowed from you.

628
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,250
You can even charge me interest if you want.

629
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,760
-We don't have money.
-Jiali.

630
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,050
Leave!

631
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,320
-Leave!
-Mom! Jiali!

632
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,100
Go away!

633
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,730
So infuriating.

634
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,750
Ignore her.

635
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,760
Mom.

636
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,160
How much do you need?

637
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,450
500,000.

638
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,950
500,000?

639
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't have that much.

640
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,020
It's okay.

641
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,820
I just thought

642
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,290
I took good care of you

643
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,430
when you were little.

644
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,910
Never mind.

645
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,550
I'll ask someone else.

646
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,720
It's fine.

647
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,270
If I pool my savings,

648
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,740
I should have 300,000 for you.

649
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,250
Let's meet at the bank

650
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,130
tomorrow morning.

651
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,410
and I'll transfer the money to you.

652
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,530
Really?

653
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,350
Jiali.

654
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,790
Thank you.

655
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,650
Once my husband finds a job,

656
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,410
we'll pay you back right away.

657
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,830
Thank you.

658
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,140
Thank you.

659
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,620
No rush to pay me back.

660
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,540
How can there be such a mother?

661
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,900
She has two daughters.

662
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,340
But she doesn't care about

663
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,790
this daughter's feelings or life at all.

664
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,530
Sorry, we're not open yet.

665
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,610
Yuan.

666
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,290
-Grandma.
-It's me.

667
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,030
I came specially for you.

668
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,360
-Me?
-Yes.

669
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,470
What's wrong?

670
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,740
I need your help.

671
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,000
Help me persuade Jiali.

672
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,540
Persuade her?

673
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,700
About what?

674
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:34,870
Well...

675
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
Are you going out?

676
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,140
You...

677
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,210
Aren't you in the store?

678
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,300
I asked Yuan

679
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,760
to come back with me.

680
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,730
I have something to tell you.

681
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,870
Is it urgent?

682
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,550
If not, can it wait until I get back?

683
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,480
I'll go with you.

684
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,880
No need, I'll be quick.

685
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,980
The bank is a ten-minute walk away.

686
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,140
I can give you a ride.

687
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,230
I told Yuan.

688
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,960
Jiali...

689
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,890
Are you really going to lend your mom the money?

690
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,740
Our shop just opened.

691
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,840
We need that money for cash flow.

692
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,930
If you give it all to them,

693
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
what about Callie's Bakery?

694
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,720
My stepfather will pay me back soon.

695
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,650
When will he find a job?

696
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,060
Will he repay it all at once,

697
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,990
or in small monthly installments?

698
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,140
Yes.

699
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,970
You've wanted to open this bakery for so long.

700
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,280
Now your dream is finally coming true.

701
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,640
You need to protect it.

702
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,300
Don't let them drag you down.

703
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,120
Jiali.

704
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,930
you need to take care of yourself more.

705
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,850
I know you crave being needed,

706
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,450
but lending them money

707
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,410
won't make her love you more.

708
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,440
Yes.

709
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,900
I hope she will love me more.

710
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,100
I might be wasting my effort,

711
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,320
but I can't help myself.

712
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,950
You don't understand

713
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,580
how strong

714
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,980
I want to be needed.

715
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,660
If they look at me a little longer

716
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,290
or come to see me a bit more,

717
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,960
it makes me happy for a long, long time.

718
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,100
You can think I'm stupid or silly.

719
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,730
If you can't accept it,

720
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,710
it's okay.

721
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,250
You can break up with me.

722
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,590
I won't blame you.

723
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:49,900
Break...

724
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,630
What are you talking about?

725
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,050
Are you serious?

726
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,810
So,

727
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,850
it's that easy

728
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,100
for you to give up on me?

729
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,310
Yuan!

730
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,560
Yuan! Don't go!

731
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,489
Yuan!

732
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,440
Jiali.

733
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,850
How could you say that?

734
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,580
You...

735
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,560
You've been downing those Irish coffee

736
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,770
one after another.

737
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,620
It has alcohol in it.

738
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,080
You're going to get drunk.

739
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm a man who's easily given up on.

740
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,560
Nothing good ever comes from arguing.

741
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,080
Jiali didn't mean it.

742
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,920
I just wanted her dream to come true.

743
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,850
But she talked about breaking up.

744
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,850
You're too blunt.

745
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,830
You don't soften your words at all.

746
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,130
She's just defending herself.

747
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,230
After all,

748
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,220
you hit her where it hurts most.

749
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,690
Of course, I know that.

750
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,050
But I...

751
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,790
I just want her

752
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,280
to think about herself,

753
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,330
to love herself more.

754
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,080
Why can't she understand?

755
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
She understands.

756
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,390
It's you who doesn't.

757
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,470
So, by what you're saying,

758
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,290
she wants to succeed

759
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,580
just to get her parents

760
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,710
to value her more.

761
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,000
So, in the end,

762
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,260
her parents' dreams are more important than her own.

763
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,800
So she won't refuse to lend them the money.

764
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,640
Okay.

765
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,630
Alright.

766
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,900
Just like Haikuo and Keke,

767
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,120
Keke often does things for Haikuo's sake,

768
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,680
but Haikuo has his own ideas

769
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,700
and principles.

770
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,980
And that stubborn mind of his.

771
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,920
Besides,

772
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,190
even couples

773
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,610
should respect each other's wishes.

774
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,930
It's not about who's right or wrong

775
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,290
based on who's looking out for whom.

776
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:26,870
Got it?

777
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

778
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,720
I didn't expect you

779
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,150
Didn't expect you to say something so wise.

780
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,520
It's because I'm in love.

781
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,800
When you're in love,

782
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,220
there's someone more important

783
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,820
than yourself in your heart.

784
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,950
So now, I'm not thinking just about myself.

785
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,860
So, you mean...

786
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,740
I should respect Jiali's wishes too.

787
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,420
Yes.

788
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,840
Since you know

789
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,530
she needs you to love her more,

790
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,620
then love her more.

791
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,890
Michael Zhao, thank you.

792
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,610
I get it now.

793
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,910
Where are you going?

794
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,950
It's about time.

795
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,920
I'm going back to Callie's Bakery

796
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,550
to keep supporting Jiali.

797
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,620
Good luck.

798
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,930
I just remembered I have something to do.

799
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,930
I'll head out now.

800
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,810
You ordered so many drinks...

801
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,200
Michael Zhao!

802
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,800
I didn't bring my wallet.

803
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,480
After we broke up,

804
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,270
I went to see your dad.

805
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
What for?

806
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,680
The general manager gave me an ultimatum.

807
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,750
If the collaboration doesn't work out,

808
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,220
I'll lose my job.

809
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,170
I knew it.

810
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,460
So what did Wang Changfa say to you?

811
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,300
I planned

812
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,490
to ask him

813
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,410
to continue cooperating with us.

814
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
But as soon as I saw him, I blamed him.

815
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,920
I probably looked really fierce,

816
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,650
but I was super nervous inside.

817
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,860
I thought I was doomed,

818
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,730
and I might have to resign to take responsibility.

819
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,640
I can help you.

820
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,020
Your dad wasn't angry.

821
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,050
He seriously shared his feelings with me.

822
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,430
Haikuo.

823
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,030
though his ways

824
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,370
are hard to accept,

825
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,780
he actually loves you.

826
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,210
And it's clear

827
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,870
you care about him too.

828
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,090
I don't.

829
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,670
Why are you so quick to deny it?

830
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,480
Because it's the truth—I don't.

831
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,610
Do you feel that

832
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,080
reconciling with him

833
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,520
is a betrayal to your mom?

834
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,360
Acknowledging that you care about him

835
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,590
isn't being disloyal to your mom.

836
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,710
And I believe

837
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,860
she would want you two to have

838
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,060
a good relationship.

839
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,290
I know

840
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,380
you're afraid

841
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,100
to show your vulnerability in front of him.

842
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,900
So,

843
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,310
you've kept your distance from him.

844
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,270
But have you considered

845
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,490
continuing this way

846
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,310
only brings you pain?

847
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,090
Listen to me.

848
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,610
Find a time

849
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,750
to talk to him.

850
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,210
Are you going to a meeting?

851
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,670
Yes, we're heading to the marketing department.

852
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,730
Keke.

853
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,430
There's something we want to tell you.

854
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,270
That's right.

855
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,950
What is it?

856
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,640
Well...

857
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,810
Well...

858
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,020
What?

859
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,420
I told you.

860
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,190
Don't bother Keke about Haikuo's business.

861
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,350
They've already broken up.

862
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,160
What's up with Haikuo?

863
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,480
It's nothing.

864
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
-He…
-Alright.

865
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,450
If you want to sugarcoat it,

866
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
that's fine with me.

867
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,790
He just had a minor car accident.

868
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,130
Haikuo had a car accident?

869
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,610
Where is he now?

870
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,150
If he's fine,

871
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,830
he should be at home.

872
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,580
Yu Fen, please.

873
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,670
-Okay.
-Thank you.

874
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,100
Look at her run;

875
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,500
it's love in motion.

876
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,720
Haikuo!

877
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,590
How...

878
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,180
How did this happen?

879
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,580
Keke, what are you talking about?

880
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,320
Didn't you have a car accident?

881
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,120
What did the doctor say?

882
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,650
Can you really not move your leg?

883
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,350
How did you get hurt so badly?

884
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,390
I was helping an auntie test her wheelchair.

885
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,420
Auntie,

886
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,950
I tested the wheelchair, and it's fine.

887
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,750
I also fixed the chair for you.

888
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,550
Be careful.

889
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,000
Thank you, young man.

890
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,590
-Thank you.
-No problem.

891
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,260
Be careful.

892
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,400
Okay, thank you.

893
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,740
Since you're fine,

894
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,630
I'll leave now.

895
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,180
Since you're here,

896
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,450
I have something

897
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,450
to tell you.

898
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,610
Don't worry about me.

899
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,410
I did have a car accident.

900
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,320
But I...

901
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:12,990
I'm fine.

902
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,090
The other party slipped

903
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,790
and broke their headlight.

904
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,330
Knowing that you came to see me

905
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,150
after hearing about my accident

906
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,600
I...

907
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,260
I'm really happy.

908
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,720
Actually, when we broke up,

909
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,310
I was

910
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,330
very sad.

911
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,660
I felt betrayed.

912
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,410
But seeing you today

913
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,230
lets me know you still...

914
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,390
Yes.

915
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,980
I still like you a lot.

916
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,420
[Preview]

917
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,190
I didn't expect Michael Zhao

918
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,820
to be such a male chauvinist.

919
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,250
Yeah, I wouldn't guess it.

920
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,100
I'm her boyfriend.

921
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,920
Contact me directly.

922
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,080
You're too controlling.

923
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,030
I don't even have the space to make friends.

924
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,990
Baby, there's no need.

925
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,650
I know you need 500,000.

926
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,740
So, I would like to ask you

927
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,480
to return the 300,000

928
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,350
that Jiali lent you before.

929
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,180
Grandma.

930
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,290
Yuanchong gave 500,000 to whom?

931
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,330
My mom?

932
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,220
Your daughter and my son have already broken up.

933
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,160
What does my relationship with my son

934
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,250
have to do with you?

935
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,890
If you can't resolve your inner conflict,

936
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,020
there will always be friction between us.

937
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,090
I want to talk with you.
