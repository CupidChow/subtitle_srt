[Episode 23]

4
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,039
Actually, when we broke up,

5
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,680
I was...

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,720
very sad.

7
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,360
I felt I was betrayed.

8
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,650
But you came to me today.

9
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,509
I know you still...

10
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,660
Yes.

11
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,050
I still like you very much.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
I like you very much.

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,420
So, love

14
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,420
can't be forgotten easily.

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,289
But we really can't be together.

16
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:58,770
Why?

17
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,420
Since we love each other,

18
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,820
why can't we be together?

19
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,539
Can you forgive your dad?

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,150
If I forgive my dad,

21
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,630
what about my mom?

22
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,070
She was so miserable and lonely

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,200
in her last days.

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
What about her?

25
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,840
That's why I'm not forcing you.

26
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,610
You said you're not forcing me.

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,720
But if I don't make up with my dad,

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,120
you will break up with me.

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,690
I don't know what this has to do with it.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,780
The love I want

31
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,700
is like my parents' love.

32
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,660
Although they quarrel

33
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,020
for trivial things

34
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,540
every day,

35
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,190
their love won't fade away.

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,260
Because they have the same values.

37
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,130
But we are really different.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520
I think money is very important.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,970
So I'm frugal.

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,840
But because of your dad,

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,780
you hate money.

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,120
If you can't resolve your inner conflict,

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,530
there will always be friction between us.

44
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,740
Do you think this kind of relationship can last long?

45
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,540
Here's your change.

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,360
Thank you.

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,420
Please come again.

48
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,330
Welcome.

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,250
Why are you here?

50
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,520
It's all Manager's fault.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
On the opening day,

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,890
he insisted on scheduling a shift for me.

53
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,459
So I couldn't come to celebrate with you.

54
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,459
That's why I came as soon as I'm free.

55
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,529
They made me lose

56
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,790
two employees in one go.

57
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,990
I'm short-handed.

58
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,000
Manager, Qianqian.

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,140
-Jiali.
-Jiali.

60
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,560
Congratulations. You really have opened a store.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,230
Thank you.

62
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,950
I smelt the bread's fragrance from afar.

63
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,420
They must be made by Jiali,

64
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,140
Yuanchong's girlfriend.

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,390
What do you want to eat today?

66
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,010
My treat.

67
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,760
Really?

68
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,500
Let me do it.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,490
No need for that.

70
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,290
They all smell so good.

71
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,360
Don't you think they're weird?

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,940
They don't have any of the intimacy

73
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,470
you'd expect from a couple.

74
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,640
It's not good

75
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,380
to act intimately during work.

76
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,060
Now they're behaving

77
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,010
more distantly than us.

78
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,730
So?

79
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,560
Based on my experience,

80
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,490
they are

81
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,490
on the outs.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,110
When my wife and I

83
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,910
-have a disagreement,
-Really?

84
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,430
we'd give each other the silent treatment.

85
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,730
We'd pretend not to see each other.

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,840
I can see.

87
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,790
You heard it?

88
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,650
Invisible man.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,090
It's my lunch break now.

90
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,840
I can't have lunch with you.

91
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,020
It's okay.

92
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,890
Our plan is

93
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,680
to eat with you

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,030
after you get off work.

95
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,650
It's not convenient.

96
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,909
Why?

97
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,090
I need to clean this place after work.

98
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,860
It'll be very tiring.

99
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,460
I just want to go home to rest.

100
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,230
I'll be back in about an hour.

101
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,830
Then you can go out

102
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,230
to have lunch with Jiali.

103
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,440
Is this for me?

104
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,920
It's not for you.

105
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,880
We're here to exchange money with you.

106
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,580
Aunt,

107
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,280
I know you need 500,000 NT dollars.

108
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,520
So, I would like to ask you

109
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,160
to give the 300,000 NT dollars you borrowed from Jiali

110
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,840
back to her

111
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,850
and tell her

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,990
you don't need the money anymore.

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,350
You mean...

114
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,780
you'll lend me money?

115
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:38,909
Yes.

116
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,060
Because Jiali

117
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,140
needs her money to run the store.

118
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,590
I don't want her

119
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,570
to be easily held back from achieving her dream.

120
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,460
You also know Jiali needs money to run her store,

121
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,250
but you still borrowed money from her.

122
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,300
How dare you!

123
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:55,890
Mom,

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,490
-I...
-Stop talking.

125
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,190
Return the money to Jiali as soon as possible.

126
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,440
Tell your husband to find a job as soon as possible

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,370
so that you can pay back the money borrowed from Yuan.

128
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,020
It's okay even if you

129
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,420
don't pay back the money.

130
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,300
W-What?

131
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,160
It's not okay.

132
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,090
But...

133
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,250
I hope

134
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,570
you can promise me one thing.

135
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,850
What is it?

136
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,980
I hope you

137
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,220
can contact Jiali frequently.

138
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,760
It's okay even if it's just a simple greeting.

139
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,900
How are you?

140
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,360
How have you been?

141
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,430
How is your work going?

142
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,050
It's also okay if you just ask her if she's full.

143
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,370
I want Jiali

144
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,780
to feel more cared-for.

145
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,270
Look.

146
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,350
Even Yuan knows he should treat Jiali well.

147
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,250
As her mother,

148
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,150
you haven't even given her a greeting.

149
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,560
She's your daughter too!

150
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,980
Grandma, don't be angry.

151
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,170
Of course I can do that.

152
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,070
In the past,

153
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,230
my youngest daughter was still little.

154
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,930
I really couldn't spare time,

155
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,530
so I ignored Jiali.

156
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,030
But I can do it now.

157
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,730
Jiali is my daughter.

158
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,530
Of course I would care about her.

159
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,450
Thank you.

160
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,010
I thought

161
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,130
you asked me to ask Jiali's mother to come out

162
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,220
because you wanted her to pay back the money.

163
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,490
Instead, you gave her money

164
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,419
and asked her to return it to Jiali.

165
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,419
Why are you so silly?

166
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,700
Grandma,

167
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm not silly.

168
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,210
I just chose

169
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,290
the current best solution

170
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,890
for Jiali.

171
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,670
I think

172
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,170
I'm very smart.

173
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,170
Don't be mad at Jiali.

174
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
Since you left that day,

175
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,260
she's been very upset after she came back

176
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,690
from work every day.

177
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,620
She has barely eaten.

178
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,300
Really?

179
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,060
Why would I lie to you?

180
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,760
Actually, I know

181
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,930
Jiali cares about you very much.

182
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,260
I know.

183
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,500
So I'm not mad at her.

184
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,720
She said she lacks love.

185
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,270
As her boyfriend,

186
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,070
I should give her lots of love.

187
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,710
Yes.

188
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,730
Great.

189
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,510
When you left that day,

190
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,430
I saw your facial expression.

191
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,940
You looked very hurt.

192
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,550
I was so worried.

193
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,850
I was worried you suffered a blow

194
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,980
and wouldn't dare to love her anymore.

195
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,050
Don't worry, Grandma.

196
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,440
Even if I feel hurt,

197
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,270
I'll become stronger

198
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,670
and love Jiali forever.

199
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,470
Yes.

200
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,380
Great!

201
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,150
I love you too.

202
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,370
Thank you, Grandma.

203
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,500
Let's go.

204
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,870
What's wrong?

205
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,870
Somehow, my shoes

206
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,000
are chafing my feet today.

207
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,020
Really?

208
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,360
What are you doing?

209
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,420
What are you doing?

210
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,840
No, put me down.

211
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,780
L-Look.

212
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,620
Someone...

213
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,120
is watching us.

214
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,040
So what?

215
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,630
I'd rather let them watch us

216
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,150
than let your feet

217
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,030
feel any discomfort.

218
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,030
Let's go.

219
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,390
I'm going to order something.

220
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,540
Excuse me?

221
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,700
Min.

222
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,470
Oscar?

223
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,620
Long time no see.

224
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,370
Long time no see.

225
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Just now, why...

226
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,670
My shoes are chafing my feet.

227
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,320
Still exaggerated.

228
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,060
Yes.

229
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,930
No.

230
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:29,970
Elly.

231
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,460
Your friend?

232
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,130
He was my classmate in Singapore.

233
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,350
Hello.

234
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,510
I'm Michael.

235
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,430
I'm Oscar.

236
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,650
Hello.

237
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm her boyfriend.

238
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,970
Okay.

239
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,970
Why don't we...

240
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,350
friend each other?

241
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,610
-Okay.
-It'll be easier to contact each other in the future.

242
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,620
Just contact me.

243
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,840
If you want to get in touch with Elly,

244
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,780
just contact me.

245
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,080
Okay.

246
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,560
Baby, do your feet feel uncomfortable?

247
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,090
No.

248
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,620
Let me carry you.

249
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,550
No need for that.

250
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,090
Right,

251
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,080
send me the contact information

252
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,440
of my former classmate.

253
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,380
It'll be weird if we contact each other through you.

254
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,740
I'm your boyfriend.

255
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,760
I think it's fine.

256
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
It won't be weird.

257
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,900
But he's my former classmate.

258
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,690
My former classmate...

259
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,360
is your former classmate.

260
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,100
Your former classmate is my former classmate.

261
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,900
We are on intimate terms, right?

262
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,170
But...

263
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,290
It's great to meet you here.

264
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,250
The shop offers a 50% discount on the second cup of coffee.

265
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,110
You... don't want coffee, right?

266
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,740
Elly, do you want a cup?

267
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,390
If it's your treat,

268
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,190
I don't mind having another cup.

269
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,600
I want one too.

270
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,840
You don't drink excitant drinks, right?

271
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,370
It's okay to drink a cup occasionally, right?

272
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,540
But if both of you want a cup,

273
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,040
you can already get a 50% discount on the second cup.

274
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,500
Well...

275
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,330
It's okay.

276
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,300
My treat.

277
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,830
I'll buy four cups and give you two cups.

278
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,830
You can give the other cup to anyone.

279
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,670
Don't waste money.

280
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,730
Forget it. I don't want it.

281
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,390
Is she angry?

282
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,200
Can't you see?

283
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,380
Is she angry because I want a cup of coffee?

284
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,010
No.

285
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,340
Elly.

286
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,930
You actually don't understand.

287
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,670
[Closed]

288
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,490
I'm off work.

289
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,410
Bye bye.

290
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,140
Bye bye.

291
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,840
This can't continue.

292
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,290
Sun Jiali,

293
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,840
Yuanchong didn't do anything wrong.

294
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,370
You should take the initiative to apologize.

295
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,740
It's not sincere to apologize via a text.

296
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,720
I should apologize to Yuanchong

297
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,360
face to face tomorrow.

298
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,760
You scared me.

299
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,550
[Sorry]

300
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,340
Jiali,

301
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,020
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,310
Please forgive me

303
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,790
for not talking to you these days

304
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,260
and giving you the silent treatment.

305
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,700
I've reflected on myself.

306
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,220
No matter how different our opinions are,

307
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,580
I shouldn't have given you the silent treatment.

308
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,730
I always said I love you

309
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,800
and I want to treat you well,

310
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,410
but what I did goes against

311
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,570
what I said completely.

312
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,160
Please forgive me

313
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,340
and give me one more chance.

314
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,190
If you are

315
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,410
still angry,

316
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,580
you can hit me,

317
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,450
scold me,

318
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,330
and kick me.

319
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,750
You can do anything to me.

320
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,170
Instead of hitting me,

321
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,470
you're hugging me.

322
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,040
Does this...

323
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,920
Does this mean you'll forgive me?

324
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,220
I want to apologize to you too.

325
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,200
Yuanchong,

326
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,220
can you forgive me?

327
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,410
You didn't do anything wrong.

328
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,329
You have your own opinions

329
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,970
and ideas.

330
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,150
It's my fault.

331
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,010
I shouldn't have forced you or compelled you.

332
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,550
From now on,

333
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,180
I will do my best to stand in your shoes.

334
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,050
I know you did it for my own good.

335
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,620
You were helping me protect my dream.

336
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,270
I was too stubborn.

337
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,590
I even said I wanted to break up with you.

338
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,080
Stop talking.

339
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,580
If you continue to talk,

340
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,070
aren't you worried that I'll run away?

341
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,950
Will you run away?

342
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,070
Of course I won't.

343
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,420
What are you watching?

344
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,760
A new movie. It's funny.

345
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,760
Don't watch this.

346
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,820
What are you doing?

347
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,360
Watch this health show.

348
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,330
I don't want to watch it. I want to watch that movie.

349
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,360
It's about the importance of sleeping early

350
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,650
and getting up early to our memory.

351
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,880
Your memory has been getting worse, right?

352
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,470
Watch.

353
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,810
-Watch.
-Who said my memory has been getting worse?

354
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I want to watch...

355
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,390
Watch.

356
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,390
Yes.

357
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,540
It says the veteran driver often takes the wrong routes.

358
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,460
Really.

359
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,820
Baby, are you reading a book?

360
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,120
Don't read this.

361
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,870
Here.

362
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,780
I found two books recently.

363
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,110
I recommend them to you.

364
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,630
They are about regimens.

365
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,490
You said you have

366
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,220
cold hands and feet these days.

367
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,890
Listen.

368
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,990
It can adjust your sleep, nutrition, emotions, and physical activities.

369
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,660
I noticed that your emotions haven't been stable recently.

370
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,430
I think you can

371
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,530
drink this.

372
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,450
Baby.

373
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,660
Baby.

374
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,860
What are you doing?

375
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,170
Wait.

376
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,970
Baby.

377
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,200
Why... Why are you packing your things?

378
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
I plan to move back tomorrow.

379
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,050
Move back?

380
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,460
No.

381
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:28,990
No.

382
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,480
Don't touch them!

383
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,630
Why do you want to move back?

384
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,580
Because I think

385
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,030
I can't breathe here.

386
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,350
You can't breathe?

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,420
I'm going to open the window.

388
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,680
That's not what I mean!

389
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,050
I think

390
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,760
we should

391
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,450
keep a proper distance.

392
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,120
We're so inseparable

393
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,520
that we don't even have

394
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,700
any private space.

395
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,670
Baby, we...

396
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
we are in a relationship, right?

397
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,650
What's wrong with being inseparable?

398
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,640
You still don't understand.

399
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm accusing you of being too controlling.

400
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,720
You're too macho.

401
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,760
Now I can't even make friends.

402
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,800
Macho?

403
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,230
I... I'm not macho.

404
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,640
I...

405
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,020
I'm just...

406
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,500
just...

407
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,740
Just...

408
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,170
Just what?

409
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,450
I'm just a little afraid.

410
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,890
Afraid of losing you.

411
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,380
But this is what a macho man is like.

412
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,450
When you're in a relationship,

413
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,650
you keep a close eye on your girlfriend.

414
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,390
You don't allow me to do

415
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,540
what I want to do.

416
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,860
I don't like this kind of relationship that makes me feel fettered.

417
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,830
Okay?

418
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,410
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,340
I really like you a lot.

420
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,160
But I think it's better

421
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,900
that we keep a distance for the time being.

422
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,680
In this way, we can continue

423
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,000
our relationship.

424
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,180
I'm going to sleep in the living room.

425
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,580
Baby, no.

426
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,540
I'm going to sleep in the living room.

427
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,940
You sleep in the bedroom.

428
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,950
Wait.

429
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,230
Baby, you're not angry?

430
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,440
Good night.

431
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,980
Go to bed early.

432
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,210
President Wang.

433
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,960
Can I talk to you?

434
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,140
Jian Keke reminded me

435
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,750
not to use Mr. Fang to control you again,

436
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,000
because you're Haikuo's best friend.

437
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,890
Why did you take the initiative to come to see me?

438
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,870
Actually, I'm not the one who wants to see you.

439
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,530
Someone asked me for help

440
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,520
in order to talk to you face to face.

441
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:52,880
Who?

442
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,860
-It's us!
-It's us!

443
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,630
You're Jian Keke's parents?

444
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,800
Yes.

445
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,670
So,

446
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,310
today, you're here to condemn me?

447
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,240
No.

448
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,320
We're here to

449
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
resolve the grudges between you

450
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,680
and Haikuo as father and son.

451
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,980
Your daughter and my son have already broken up.

452
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,640
What does the relationship between my son and me

453
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,720
have to do with you guys?

454
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,150
Because our daughter Keke and Haikuo

455
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,730
love each other.

456
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,830
But

457
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,950
because of you,

458
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,010
they had no choice but to break up.

459
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,050
We hope that

460
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,850
Haikuo and Keke can be together.

461
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,360
Whether Haikuo and Keke will be together

462
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,690
is his own decision.

463
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,140
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do on this matter.

464
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,000
So there's nothing to talk about.

465
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,820
See you.

466
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,830
-No.
-President.

467
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,840
-Let me tell you.
-Wait.

468
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,080
I did talk to Haikuo.

469
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,530
I can feel that

470
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,530
he really respects you.

471
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,660
What's more,

472
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,450
he admires you very much.

473
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,190
Since childhood, we've been educated that

474
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,760
no parents in the world make mistakes.

475
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,160
But I always think that

476
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,630
there's something wrong with this saying.

477
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,170
There are no human beings

478
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,890
who never make mistakes.

479
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,340
Just take myself as an example.

480
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,070
I once lent all our family's savings

481
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,320
to one of my best friends

482
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,220
because of my momentary softheartedness.

483
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,890
As a result, even until now,

484
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,490
I haven't got any money back.

485
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,240
Because of that, my daughter and my wife

486
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,800
have been suffering with me.

487
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,670
Dear, it's all in the past.

488
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,550
So what?

489
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,890
A father also makes mistakes sometimes.

490
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,490
Right?

491
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,350
He's not a god.

492
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,130
-Right.
-Right?

493
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:54,820
Right.

494
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,490
Right.

495
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,100
Right.

496
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,470
What's more, we often educate our children and say that

497
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,930
if you do something wrong,

498
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
you have to admit your mistake and apologize.

499
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,050
Right?

500
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,370
Then let me ask you.

501
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,390
As a parent,

502
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,790
if you do something wrong,

503
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,250
don't you need to admit your mistake and apologize to your child?

504
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:10,900
Also,

505
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,120
a child usually puts his parents

506
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,030
in the most important position in his heart.

507
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,500
If you really love him,

508
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,120
don't give him a hard time.

509
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,150
Why did you ask him to make a choice

510
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,540
between you two?

511
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,420
That was quite cruel.

512
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,950
Right?

513
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,620
Right?

514
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,400
-Right.
-Right!

515
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,650
I still have an important meeting to attend.

516
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,910
You guys can leave now.

517
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,850
We've talked so much to persuade you, but you...

518
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,880
-Don't stop me.
-Alright.

519
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,210
-I really...
-Alright.

520
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,460
He's just like a stone.

521
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,590
What do you want to tell him?

522
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,320
Okay. I won't talk to him.

523
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,090
-How stubborn he is.
-How about we knock him with an iron hammer?

524
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,810
No need.

525
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,030
As the president, he's a bigshot.

526
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,060
"President" means that he's always dismissed.

527
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,020
I just don't want to come.

528
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,100
-How stubborn.
-Bye.

529
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,230
Yes, how stubborn.

530
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,650
I wonder if President Wang's attitude

531
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,910
will soften.

532
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,150
Oh God.

533
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,470
God.

534
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,210
Dear gods,

535
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,850
please bless us so that President Wang will go learn about Haikuo

536
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,780
and let Haikuo be with Keke.

537
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,930
Otherwise,

538
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,680
the Accounting Department will become a cruel hell soon.

539
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,280
What?

540
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,900
You want to move out of Michael Zhao's home?

541
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,120
He's keeping an eye on me too closely.

542
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,320
I'm afraid one day,

543
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,070
I won't even have a male friend.

544
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,970
I didn't expect that Michael Zhao

545
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,610
would be such a male chauvinist.

546
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,080
Right. I didn't sense that.

547
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,990
He usually looks like this

548
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,790
and like this.

549
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,820
But let me tell you.

550
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,760
This kind of man is actually very dangerous.

551
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,840
The stronger his desire for controlling his girlfriend is,

552
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,970
the more easily he'll fail to control himself.

553
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,610
By that time, you may become

554
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,810
a horror lover.

555
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,530
I didn't expect that he would be like this.

556
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,980
Right. How is that possible?

557
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,670
He doesn't look like that.

558
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,480
He just doesn't look like that.

559
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,080
Elly.

560
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,330
If you really care about Michael Zhao,

561
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,110
just have a talk with me.

562
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,160
Go ahead.

563
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,810
But I only have ten minutes.

564
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,610
I have a meeting to attend later.

565
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,010
Do you remember Michael Zhao once said that

566
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,930
all this time, he didn't believe that you liked him?

567
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,050
Yes, I remember.

568
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,720
But later, he believed it,

569
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,960
so we became boyfriend and girlfriend.

570
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,520
No.

571
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,590
I don't think he has ever believed it all this time.

572
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,250
That's why he feels insecure.

573
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

574
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,150
In the past, boys always chased me initiatively.

575
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,420
Now I've taken the initiative to chase him.

576
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,920
How could he feel insecure?

577
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,220
That's the point.

578
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,620
In the past, boys always chased you initiatively.

579
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,680
What's more, those were all rich men.

580
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,330
So, you've never believed that

581
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,610
I genuinely like you,

582
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,630
because my past targets

583
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,010
were all rich men?

584
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,610
The woman I love

585
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,250
should love me only.

586
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,440
Because

587
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,890
I will also love her only

588
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,890
wholeheartedly.

589
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Then I'm more eager to live with you.

590
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,260
Only in this way

591
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,790
can you sense my sincerity.

592
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,360
He really doesn't believe it?

593
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,310
Michael Zhao really likes you.

594
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,100
He likes you very much.

595
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,800
That's why he feels so insecure.

596
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,170
He did that because he was afraid that

597
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,190
you would be taken away by a man who is better than him.

598
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,760
But it is obvious that I really like him.

599
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,370
Why doesn't he believe in me?

600
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,310
Elly,

601
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
don’t forget that

602
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,160
before you dated each other,

603
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,990
you and Michael Zhao

604
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,700
had been colleagues for many years.

605
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,030
Your affections for him

606
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,820
appeared

607
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,910
so suddenly.

608
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,650
I don't care what reason you have.

609
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,110
Return the money now.

610
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,710
Do you have a conscience?

611
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,590
Jiali's 300,000 NT dollars,

612
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,570
and Yuan's 500,000 NT dollars

613
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,190
were all pocketed by you privately.

614
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,390
How... How dare you!

615
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,990
-Stop talking about it!
-Grandma.

616
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,630
Why did you come back suddenly?

617
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,390
To whom did you say that Yuanchong had given 500,000 NT dollars?

618
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,050
Did he give the money to my mom?

619
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,260
No.

620
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,320
You... You heard it wrong.

621
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,380
Grandma.

622
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,810
Don't lie to me.

623
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,220
Why did Yuanchong give her money?

624
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,490
Because...

625
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,120
She thought that I didn't give her enough money,

626
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,580
so she borrowed money again from Yuanchong?

627
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,010
No.

628
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,460
Your mother didn't borrow money from him.

629
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,000
Yuan just took the initiative to give her money.

630
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,070
He hoped that

631
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,470
your mother would return the money to you.

632
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,990
I was wondering

633
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,220
why there had been no news

634
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,410
after so many days,

635
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,530
so I called to urge her.

636
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,010
So, you mean that

637
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,820
she not only took my money,

638
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,850
but also took away Yuanchong's 500,000 NT dollars?

639
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,150
Yes.

640
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,910
Your mom told me that she was in short of money

641
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,970
and asked me not to tell you two about it.

642
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,640
Jiali.

643
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,780
Don't blame Yuan.

644
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,740
He was worried that without the operating funds,

645
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,010
your shop would go bankrupt.

646
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:50,670
Jiali!

647
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,280
Jiali, where are you going?

648
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,790
You have to know that

649
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,050
sharing food is the same as sharing love.

650
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,710
Yes.

651
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,250
Excuse me. I need to answer the phone.

652
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,220
Okay.

653
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,300
Hello, Grandma.

654
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,360
What's the matter?

655
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,720
What?

656
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,420
Okay. I got it.

657
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,750
I'll go there right now.

658
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,660
I don't want to hear any reason from you.

659
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,150
Go bring Yuanchong's 500,000 NT dollars

660
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,230
for me now.

661
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,520
Otherwise, I'll call the police

662
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
and tell them that you swindled him.

663
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,030
I didn't swindle him.

664
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,570
He gave me the money himself.

665
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,160
Do you have a conscience?

666
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,120
Yuan gave the money to you

667
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,380
and told you to return the money to Jiali.

668
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,290
I didn't say that I wouldn't return the money.

669
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,410
I'll just return all the money

670
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,610
together later.

671
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,570
-You...
-No way!

672
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,100
It's fine if you don't return my money to me.

673
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,500
Go withdraw Yuanchong's

674
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,040
500,000 NT dollars from the bank right now.

675
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,300
Let's go get the money.

676
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,190
-No!
-Let's go get the money.

677
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,960
-No!
-Let's go. Stop nagging.

678
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,130
Let's go get the money.

679
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,680
Jiali!

680
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,980
Sun Jiali!

681
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,390
How could you treat me like this?

682
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,610
Then how did you treat me?

683
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,920
Have you ever regarded me as your daughter?

684
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,300
Have you ever cared about me?

685
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,159
You only care about

686
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,710
whether I'm useful or not.

687
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,469
I was just like a fool

688
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,920
and had been longing for family love that I couldn't get.

689
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,980
In the end, I neglected those who really cared about me.

690
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,770
From now on,

691
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,300
I, Sun Jiali,

692
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,010
won't long for such a feeling of

693
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,120
being needed.

694
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,780
My efforts

695
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,280
will only be left to those who truly care about me

696
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,610
and show concern for me.

697
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,270
Well said!

698
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,510
Jiali,

699
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:56,760
I fully support you.

700
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,440
As for you,

701
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,540
speaking of you...

702
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,330
How did you fulfill your responsibilities as a mother?

703
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,500
You've gone too far.

704
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,710
I'm telling you that you should know your place.

705
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,030
Give her the money now.

706
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,060
That's right.

707
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,140
You're Jiali's mother.

708
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,300
If you do this,

709
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,560
you'll put Jiali in an awkward position.

710
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,790
Let's go.

711
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,490
Go withdraw the money from the bank.

712
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,090
Let's go.

713
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,190
-Come with me.
-Mom.

714
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,520
Let's go withdraw the money from the bank.

715
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,750
Stop nagging. Let's go.

716
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,070
She has gone too far.

717
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,060
Li Yuanchong.

718
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,580
I promise you that

719
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,840
from now on,

720
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,320
I will love myself more.

721
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,640
If you want it,

722
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,310
you can also love me more.

723
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,260
In the end, it's the same as the beginning.

724
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm back to my single life.

725
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,140
Elly.

726
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,730
I'm sorry.

727
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,820
Are you trying to break up with me?

728
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,190
I like you so much.

729
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,860
How could I break up with you?

730
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,750
I'm apologizing to you

731
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,150
because I forgot to tell you

732
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,770
the reason why I fell in love with you.

733
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,930
All this time,

734
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,930
the condition I've set for myself for choosing a spouse

735
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,110
is that I should select a man with three high standards.

736
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,730
But

737
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,380
these are all based on the rules of the outside world.

738
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,980
Actually, what I really want is

739
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,950
ordinary happiness.

740
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,800
Ordinary happiness?

741
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,500
You're dating me

742
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,430
just because I'm ordinary?

743
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,040
Yes.

744
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,990
Because I'm quite ordinary, too.

745
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,670
So,

746
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,960
from now on,

747
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,780
I don't need to sleep with an eyeshade anymore.

748
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,820
Nor do I need to care about my appearance

749
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,380
and dressing style so much.

750
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,090
Because I know that

751
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,840
you won't stop loving me

752
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,010
because I'm ordinary.

753
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,710
So,

754
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,370
I won't stop loving you

755
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,970
because you're ordinary.

756
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,490
Even if I'm not rich,

757
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,070
and even if I'm ordinary,

758
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,700
will you still love me?

759
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,540
We can

760
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,500
earn money together.

761
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,840
I forgot to tell you that

762
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,180
I've put all my designer handbags

763
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,310
on a second-hand website and sold them at auction.

764
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,040
I've even earned a sum of money.

765
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,590
We can put

766
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,520
this sum of money

767
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,480
in our fund for purchasing a house.

768
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,770
Also,

769
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
I've deleted

770
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,080
the contact numbers of all irrelevant men

771
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,310
from my mobile phone.

772
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,010
I only kept my dad's,

773
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,500
my relatives'

774
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,050
and all our company's...

775
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,060
You don't have to tell me these things.

776
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,400
It'll be fine that you just like me.

777
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,630
Mi.

778
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,210
Mi.

779
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,070
Mi, don't cry.

780
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,450
Don't cry.

781
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:19,650
Mi.

782
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,570
Don't cry.

783
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,810
Mi.

784
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,250
All this time,

785
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,370
I've always wanted to say that

786
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't dare to be with you,

787
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,330
because I'm not confident in myself.

788
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,560
But today, after hearing you say that,

789
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
I feel very happy.

790
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,970
Mi, don't cry.

791
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,330
Please don't leave me.

792
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,710
Silly boy, I won't leave you.

793
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,950
I really like you so much.

794
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,920
I like you very much.

795
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,760
I also like you very much.

796
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,610
I want to talk with you.

797
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,530
I want to apologize to you.

798
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,770
Can you give me this chance?

799
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,960
Stop looking.

800
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,290
There's nothing that is worth looking at.

801
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,380
You haven't got a child yet.

802
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,250
You won't understand

803
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,530
how much a father would miss his child.

804
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,320
What you want to tell me is not about missing your child,

805
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,850
but something else, right?

806
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,020
For a father,

807
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,280
the most painful thing

808
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,750
is that his own child

809
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,900
returned the money for upbringing

810
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,680
to him so resolutely.

811
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,620
He didn't want a single penny.

812
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,320
He just wanted to cut off the relationship in this way.

813
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,740
But can you measure the family affection

814
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,330
between father and son with money?

815
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,840
If you have nothing important to say,

816
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,220
please leave first.

817
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,700
There's nothing about the past that's worth talking about between us.

818
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,810
This is my most precious photo album.

819
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,460
What is recorded inside

820
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,850
is about your birthday every year.

821
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,610
Every year on your birthday,

822
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,660
the three of us in our family would take a photo together,

823
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,500
because you were our baby.

824
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,290
Your birth brought us joy.

825
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,030
But since the day when your mother passed away,

826
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,710
I've not only lost my beloved wife,

827
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,280
but also lost my most precious son.

828
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,490
Since then,

829
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,000
every year on your birthday,

830
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,140
I've faied to stay by your side.

831
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,430
Because you rejected me.

832
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,060
Because I refused to apologize.

833
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,300
That's why we've wasted time for many years.

834
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,370
As for the good wishes I wanted to give you,

835
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,680
I could only ask someone to secretly take

836
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,400
a photo of you on your birthday,

837
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
and then I would hold the photo alone

838
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,520
to sing the song of Happy Birthday privately.

839
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,350
Haikuo,

840
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,270
you're a year older now again.

841
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,030
I hope your wish will come true.

842
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,200
Happy birthday to you.

843
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,610
I can only care about my son secretly.

844
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,200
But even though I missed you so much,

845
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,860
I still refused to apologize.

846
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,760
Because I always thought that

847
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,220
one day, you would understand

848
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,620
why I had taken such great pains as a father.

849
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,600
Son,

850
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,240
it was my fault.

851
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,290
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,240
[Preview]

853
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,800
You proposed to Elly?

854
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,470
Am I quite sincere?

855
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,590
But you're going back to Singapore

856
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,420
with Elly next week to meet her parents

857
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,150
for the first time, aren't you?

858
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,970
You'll give them a wedding invitation letter when you meet them for the first time.

859
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,000
Does buying a ring

860
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,130
has the same meaning as what I know?

861
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,770
I want to get engaged with you

862
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,590
so that I can be your future wife.

863
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,220
Yu Fen.

864
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,460
I like you.

865
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,940
Will you be my girlfriend?

866
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,040
You should go sign the contract personally.

867
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,030
I'll ask Chen Shi, the manager of Division One, to go with you.

868
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,030
General Manager, TV Group's representative is here.

869
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:35,760
Haikuo?
