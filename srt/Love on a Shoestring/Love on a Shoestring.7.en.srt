[Episode 7]

4
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,810
You are

5
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,240
Haikuo's most capable subordinate

6
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,330
and his good friend,

7
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,950
so I want to ask you for a favor.

8
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,720
His love matters

9
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,780
are not something I can intervene in.

10
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,950
I'm not asking you to intervene.

11
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,490
I want you...

12
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,870
to create an opportunity for me.

13
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,810
This...

14
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,870
Keke and Haikuo are not actually in a relationship.

15
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,870
But my feelings for Haikuo are real.

16
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,920
But his feelings for Keke are real.

17
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,890
In this case,

18
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,830
you don't want him to be sad forever,

19
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,509
right?

20
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:54,160
The best way to heal a broken heart

21
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,920
is to start a new relationship.

22
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,070
Excuse me.

23
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,390
I'm talking.

24
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,590
Can you look at me?

25
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,000
I heard you.

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,740
You're right.

27
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,060
I do hope he can get over it soon.

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,100
So if you want him to like you,

29
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,310
you can take advantage of the fact that he has a weak stomach.

30
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,510
He has a weak stomach?

31
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,230
He has stomach problems?

32
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,960
Hey!

33
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,090
During the health check-up,

34
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,970
he told me he has a weak stomach.

35
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,270
It's because he often stayed up late

36
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,940
and was under a lot of work pressure in the past.

37
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,870
So,

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,630
if you take good care of his stomach,

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,720
maybe he'll have feelings for you.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,750
I see.

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,670
Chen Shi, thank you.

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,350
Thank you.

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,120
Stomach problems.

44
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,880
Haikuo,

45
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,680
you're here.

46
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,579
Wait a minute here.

47
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,490
The takeaway will be here soon.

48
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,390
Takeaway?

49
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,130
I know you have stomach problems,

50
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,060
so I specially ordered breakfast for you.

51
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,720
There are vegetable and fruit juice,

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,760
boiled eggs, and sweet potatoes.

53
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,520
Wang Haikuo.

54
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,320
This is the fish soup I made for you.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,850
Drinking something hot in the morning is good for your stomach.

56
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,620
Mina.

57
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,860
You're making coffee?

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,950
Yes, Elly.

59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,760
Let me help you deliver the coffee inside.

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
No need for that.

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,620
Someone has delivered the coffee inside.

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,520
Who?

63
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,170
According to Yihan,

64
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,610
the operating expenses account for...

65
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,730
Why are you the one delivering the coffee?

66
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,590
Mina is busy, so I came to deliver the coffee for her.

67
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,300
Thank you.

68
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,440
Not this one.

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,300
Thank you.

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,890
Why is Mr. Wang's coffee different from ours?

71
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,460
He has stomach problems,

72
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,659
so he can't drink anything that will irritate his stomach.

73
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,790
That's why I prepared oat milk for him.

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,290
What about me?

75
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,790
There's still one cup left.

76
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,290
I'm giving it to you, okay?

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,910
Mr. Wang,

78
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,620
why were you smiling secretly

79
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,220
in the meeting room just now?

80
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,520
Can't you tell?

81
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,760
So it's true.

82
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,670
You haven't given up Keke.

83
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,060
How can people

84
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
easily give up the one they like?

85
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,950
Then why did you agree to break up with her?

86
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,159
Because she doesn't like me currently

87
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,090
and I don't want to pressure her.

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,690
Plus

89
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,340
the intervention of Michael Zhao and Elly,

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,380
it's tricky.

91
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,400
So,

92
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,820
I'm willing to break up with her temporarily.

93
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,060
You told me at the health examination center

94
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,030
that you have stomach problems. Was that a lie too?

95
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,710
No.

96
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,550
There's really something wrong with my stomach.

97
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,050
But I didn't expect

98
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,200
although Keke doesn't like me,

99
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,740
she would still care about me voluntarily.

100
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,610
She's really thoughtful.

101
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,740
Oh no.

102
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,730
I think your love for her has grown deeper.

103
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,600
Is this love?

104
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,110
I'm looking forward to it.

105
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,240
How do you plan to pursue her?

106
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,360
Since I can't take the initiative,

107
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,290
I'll just take a passive attitude.

108
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,430
I will still accept

109
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,560
Keke's kindness and thoughtfulness.

110
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,130
Then I'll gradually create opportunities.

111
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,750
What you see

112
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,750
and even what you want

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,500
can become weapons.

114
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,580
I don't understand.

115
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,110
But

116
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm still worried that your heart

117
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,830
will be broken one day.

118
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,530
[Trendee]

119
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,930
Turn the volume down!

120
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,530
Can't you see we're talking?

121
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,630
Why are you making the volume so high in a public place?

122
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,960
Where are your manners?

123
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,590
So self-centered.

124
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,280
You are really sharp-tongued.

125
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,490
You didn't care about his feelings when you criticized him.

126
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,420
Actually, you are no better than me.

127
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,120
You broke up with Haikuo,

128
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
but you still keep pestering him.

129
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
I did break up with him,

130
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,620
but we're still good colleagues and good friends.

131
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,930
What? Is there a problem?

132
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,690
Do you know

133
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,490
it will make Haikuo upset

134
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,260
if you often appear in front of him?

135
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,760
How do you know Haikuo is upset?

136
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,890
Did he tell you that?

137
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,970
Even if he's upset,

138
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,440
it's between me and him.

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
It's none of your business.

140
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,350
Why are you angry?

141
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,130
Do you mean

142
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm in no position to be angry?

143
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,270
I'm just stating the facts.

144
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,510
Besides, if Haikuo really hates me,

145
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,910
I will stay away from him.

146
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,630
I don't need you to remind me.

147
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,800
Jian Keke,

148
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,020
I'm warning you.

149
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,280
Don't be so arrogant.

150
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,150
You're right. I'm arrogant.

151
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,220
I'm not like you, who has been given the cold shoulder.

152
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,190
Haikuo has ignored you,

153
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,130
but you keep pestering him.

154
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,610
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

155
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,770
How do you know that?

156
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,090
It's so obvious.

157
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,500
Is it hard to know?

158
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I have things to do.

159
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Bye-bye.

160
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,960
Jian Keke!

161
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,720
What I want is Americano.

162
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,770
Americano, do you understand?

163
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I'm really sorry.

165
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,730
I don't want your apology.

166
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,230
Just make a cup of Americano for me.

167
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,150
What I want is Americano. Americano!

168
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,590
I'm in a hurry.

169
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,490
What's wrong with you?

170
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,420
Miss, sorry.

171
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
What's wrong?

172
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,590
I ordered a cup of Americano,

173
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,260
but he made latte.

174
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,720
Okay, I'll ask him

175
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,720
to make a cup of Americano immediately for...

176
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,110
I don't want him to make it again.

177
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,110
He already made three cups of latte.

178
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,200
Sorry.

179
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,680
I don't want your apology.

180
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,930
I want Americano.

181
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Please, just give me a cup of Americano!

182
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,390
Give it to me!

183
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,260
Give me Americano!

184
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,230
Okay, Americano.

185
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,190
It's okay. I'm going to make a cup of Americano for you now.

186
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,860
I'm in a hurry.

187
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,960
My boss is waiting.

188
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,060
Can you take the responsibility if I get fired?

189
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,330
Can you afford it?

190
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,560
Yuanchong,

191
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,590
is something bothering you?

192
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,880
You made the wrong coffee three times in succession.

193
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,540
If this continues,

194
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,550
it'll be like working in vain.

195
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,680
Indeed,

196
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,420
there is something bothering me.

197
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,730
Tell me then.

198
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,430
Maybe I can help you.

199
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,210
Manager.

200
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,480
What should a boy do

201
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,550
to become a man?

202
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,150
Why are you asking me

203
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,210
such an exciting question in public?

204
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,610
Can't we talk about it in public?

205
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,510
It's not that we can't.

206
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,060
You're young.

207
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,270
You young people are bold.

208
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,060
To become a man, right?

209
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,350
Manager,

210
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,730
that's not what I mean.

211
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,450
What I mean is

212
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,860
what I should do

213
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,020
to become a real man.

214
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,140
So just now, you didn't mean...

215
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,980
No.

216
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,410
Yuanchong,

217
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,310
you

218
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,300
look too serious

219
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,140
and you don't talk too much.

220
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,840
This can easily cause misunderstandings.

221
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,980
Just now,

222
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,720
I specially showed you

223
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,130
how embarrassing it can be

224
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,260
if you don't

225
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,140
say it clearly.

226
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,380
Think about it.

227
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,610
If it's a girl,

228
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,370
it would make her very confused.

229
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,270
Right?

230
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,580
I see.

231
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,740
Then what...

232
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,230
what should I do?

233
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,880
To become a real man,

234
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,640
you have to be brave

235
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,480
to express your thoughts

236
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,260
and be willing to accept others' criticism.

237
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,590
Most importantly,

238
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,350
you should exercise often.

239
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,890
In this way, you can give girls

240
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,270
a sense of security.

241
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,560
Understand?

242
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,930
Come on, Mr. Wang.

243
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,020
A toast to you two.

244
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,000
To be honest,

245
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,060
this time's case went smoothly

246
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,240
thanks to you two.

247
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,260
You're being too polite.

248
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,950
I'm so happy today.

249
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,530
Mr. Wang, I didn't expect you to hold liquor so well.

250
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,390
Yeah.

251
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,320
I've never seen anyone

252
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,260
who can hold liquor so well like you before.

253
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,030
I am

254
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,960
flattered.

255
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,790
In front of you two,

256
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,190
it's

257
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,080
not even worth mentioning.

258
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,070
You're being too modest, Mr. Wang.

259
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,140
Is it okay for you to drink like this?

260
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,070
You have stomach problems, right?

261
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,280
It's okay. I brought stomach medicine.

262
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,590
What are you whispering about?

263
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,850
Do you want to run away?

264
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,690
No.

265
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,830
No, we just haven't met someone

266
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,690
who can hold liquor so well for a long time.

267
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,010
Of course we should discuss strategies.

268
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,730
Yes.

269
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,530
-Come on. Drink.
-Discuss strategies.

270
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,900
-Drink.
-One more cup.

271
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,200
Come on.

272
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,870
Bottoms up.

273
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,600
Impressive.

274
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,760
Pour more for Mr. Wang.

275
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,710
Mr. Wang's cup

276
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,120
-can't be empty. Come on.
-Okay.

277
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,980
Cheers.

278
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,180
Come on, drink more.

279
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,300
Mr. Wang.

280
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,750
Mr. Wang, are you okay?

281
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,710
Mr. Wang.

282
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,210
How are you?

283
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,130
I just vomited. I feel much better.

284
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,070
You don't look well at all.

285
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,170
You can't drink anymore.

286
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,370
You should refuse them after we go back.

287
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,640
If we refuse them now,

288
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,690
the wine I drank just now would be for nothing.

289
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,300
But...

290
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,570
What's our purpose today?

291
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,150
Our purpose is to get the order.

292
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,440
Besides, it's very difficult to make an appointment with them.

293
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,160
We finally managed to make an appointment with them.

294
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,220
We should carry it through to the end.

295
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,830
You can't risk your health like this.

296
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,400
I need to make money

297
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,010
to pay my debts.

298
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,990
You are in debt?

299
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,990
People are already in debt

300
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,200
from the moment they were born.

301
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,570
Let's go.

302
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,130
We've been out for too long.

303
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,210
To become a real man,

304
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,380
the first step

305
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,880
is to exercise

306
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,060
to have strong arms.

307
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,060
To become a real man,

308
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,020
the second step

309
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,540
is to be flexible

310
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,620
and dauntless.

311
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,510
Since I can't become stronger by exercising,

312
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,270
I should start

313
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,040
from mastering facial expressions.

314
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,840
The third step

315
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,980
is to get over shyness.

316
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,840
Smile at everyone.

317
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,440
Hi.

318
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,570
Hello.

319
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,930
Hello. Hello.

320
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,150
Hi.

321
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,230
Hello. Hello.

322
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,260
Good morning.

323
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,090
What's wrong with you?

324
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,720
Little girl.

325
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,850
Hi.

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,010
[Weird Uncle]

327
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,030
Mom, look at him. He's so weird.

328
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,220
Don't look at or point at him.

329
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,190
He's weird.

330
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,420
What are you doing?

331
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,740
Are you a pervert?

332
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,290
I'm not a pervert.

333
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm not a pervert.

334
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,579
I'm just practicing

335
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,440
mastering facial expressions.

336
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,030
Bye-bye.

337
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,480
Chen Shi.

338
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,360
Mr. Wang.

339
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,600
The client called to talk about the contract's content.

340
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,820
What's wrong?

341
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,800
There's nothing wrong with it.

342
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,970
We can move on to the next stage:

343
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,900
contract signing.

344
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,910
Yes!

345
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,630
Finally.

346
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,410
We didn't drink for nothing.

347
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,420
Yeah. Recently, I've been...

348
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,700
Now that the contract's content has been confirmed,

349
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,820
we can be relieved.

350
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,180
Yes.

351
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Finally, you don't have to drink anymore.

352
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,970
You don't have to take stomach medicine three times a day either.

353
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,720
I'm really worried that you can't hold on.

354
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,640
I'm fine.

355
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,610
Anyway, the next stage is the most important.

356
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,510
You must keep a close eye on them until the contract is signed.

357
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,510
No problem. I'll keep an eye on them.

358
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,590
I heard you just got another big order

359
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,780
and made a lot of money for the company.

360
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,330
Division Three is not bad too.

361
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,570
Your performance is still so impressive.

362
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,230
In that case,

363
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,680
we are evenly matched.

364
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,190
But before you came,

365
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,150
I was

366
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,380
the only standout.

367
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,660
You were so outstanding?

368
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,380
But it's lonely.

369
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Isn't it better to have someone working hard with you?

370
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,320
Maybe I just like the feeling

371
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,360
of being like a crane standing among chickens.

372
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,700
You may need to work harder.

373
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,000
Because currently,

374
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,950
I think you are just a chicken.

375
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,840
Are you challenging me?

376
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,480
Can't you tell?

377
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,550
Of course I can.

378
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,860
But you should be careful from now on.

379
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,720
Because I'll do my best

380
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,040
to defeat you.

381
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,220
Please do me a favor again.

382
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,700
Something happened!

383
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,810
Something serious happened.

384
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,210
Something happened in the Business Department.

385
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,610
Is it about the contract?

386
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,350
No.

387
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,120
Haikuo and Michael Zhao had a fight.

388
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,650
Impossible.

389
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,300
Considering Michael Zhao's personality,

390
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,760
he would never hit anyone.

391
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,900
Moreover,

392
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,130
he's very afraid of hurting his skin.

393
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,480
Rumors in the company

394
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,070
are getting more and more exaggerated.

395
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,730
No.

396
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,100
Listen to me.

397
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,000
I didn't believe it at first.

398
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,580
But I went to take a look just now.

399
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,310
There's really an ambulance downstairs.

400
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,230
Besides, Haikuo was carried into the ambulance.

401
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,000
Haikuo?

402
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,450
Is Michael Zhao that strong?

403
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,190
Let's go take a look now.

404
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,940
Wait, I need to change my shoes.

405
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,820
Be careful.

406
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,600
Are you okay?

407
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,300
Yes.

408
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,070
Let's go.

409
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,000
Are they okay?

410
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,770
Chen Shi.

411
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,370
How's Haikuo?

412
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,370
What's wrong?

413
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,420
Well...

414
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,170
Chen Shi.

415
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,870
Nothing.

416
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,620
Don't worry.

417
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,890
I'm going to the hospital with him first.

418
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,960
It's okay.

419
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,230
I'm fine.

420
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
-Who?
-It's okay.

421
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,360
It's Haikuo who is in the ambulance, right?

422
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,750
I didn't see it clearly.

423
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,440
Chen Shi went to the hospital too.

424
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,290
It must be Haikuo.

425
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,020
I wonder if he's badly injured.

426
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,000
If Haikuo is in the ambulance,

427
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,340
where is Michael Zhao?

428
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,620
Is he in the Business Department?

429
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,410
What on earth happened?

430
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,170
Michael Zhao.

431
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,400
Why did you have a conflict with Haikuo?

432
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,660
I didn't.

433
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,210
We were just talking about the performance.

434
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,570
I think you mean you've been competing to achieve better performance, right?

435
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,070
You can't outshine him, so you hit him.

436
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,500
It's wrong to hit someone.

437
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,070
That's right. You look like a gentleman.

438
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,670
I didn't expect that you would hit someone.

439
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,470
I didn't.

440
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,550
I just patted him like this.

441
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Then he fell down.

442
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,510
But you should be careful from now on.

443
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,370
Because

444
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,370
I will do my best

445
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,500
to defeat you.

446
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,860
Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang!

447
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,890
Mr. Wang!

448
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,360
Mr. Wang, are you okay?

449
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,280
Mr. Wang!

450
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,190
-I...
-Call an ambulance!

451
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,500
-I didn't...
-Call 119.

452
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,570
-I didn't hit him.
-Are you okay, Mr. Wang?

453
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,770
-Mr. Wang.
-Mr. Wang.

454
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,970
Stop lying.

455
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,500
Haikuo is not made of paper.

456
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,030
It's true.

457
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,470
I just patted him like this.

458
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,430
Then he...

459
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,230
Like this?

460
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,110
I'm so strong.

461
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,660
Yuanchong,

462
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,610
you

463
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,340
look too serious and you don't talk too much.

464
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,740
This can easily cause misunderstandings.

465
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,840
I already told you.

466
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,670
What exactly do you want?

467
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,470
No.

468
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,480
Please.

469
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,490
-Stop pulling me.
-Let her go!

470
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,290
I don't want to break up with you.

471
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,900
How come it's you again?

472
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,460
Don't pester Jiali again.

473
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,940
What on earth does it have to do with you?

474
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,180
It has nothing to do with me.

475
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,810
But

476
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,690
I'll definitely interfere in this matter.

477
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,530
On what grounds can you do that?

478
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,520
Enough!

479
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,680
Zhigang, go back at once.

480
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,490
Jiali.

481
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,730
I said those words sincerely just now.

482
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,500
I really regret it.

483
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,300
I don't want to break up with you.

484
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,430
You still dare to ask her to get back together with you?

485
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,100
I'm really not used to it these days after we broke up.

486
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,760
I really...

487
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,580
I really miss you.

488
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,510
Are you kidding me?

489
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,600
You only thought of the good things about her after breaking up with her.

490
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,860
You're just a scumbag.

491
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,460
I've broken up with Weishan thoroughly.

492
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,260
If you don't believe me,

493
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
you can check my mobile phone.

494
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,000
A scumbag usually

495
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
doesn't have only one mobile phone.

496
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,250
Can you shut up?

497
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,270
You've been nagging all the time over there.

498
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,880
Do you think you're a narrator?

499
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,910
I'm just talking about your bad deeds.

500
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,970
How dare you ask her to get back together with you after you cheated on her?

501
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,340
I'll say it again.

502
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,660
Get lost!

503
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,080
You're not welcome here.

504
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,070
What on earth does it have to do with you?

505
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,730
You've been...

506
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,760
Alright. Enough!

507
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,860
I'm asking you to go away!

508
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,980
Enough!

509
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,310
Go! Go!

510
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,460
I've told you

511
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,790
not to make a scene here.

512
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,270
Zhigang, I won't get back together with you.

513
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,460
Jiali.

514
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,900
I can't live without you.

515
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,170
I need you.

516
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,500
Without you by my side,

517
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,000
it seems that there's a lack of something for me.

518
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,500
I really can't be without you in my life.

519
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,540
So, I beg you.

520
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,740
I need you by my side.

521
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,150
Let me think about it.

522
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,620
Don't abandon me.

523
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,430
Okay?

524
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,100
Jiali.

525
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,440
-Please.
-You bastard!

526
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,640
Despicable scumbag!

527
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,960
Grandma.

528
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,170
How dare you come to see our Jiali shamelessly?

529
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,230
I'll beat you to death!

530
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,970
Grandma!

531
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,910
Despicable scumbag!

532
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,100
You even cheated on her!

533
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,150
You cheated on her!

534
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,110
Don't run away if you have guts!

535
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,970
Let me tell you. I'll beat you up every time I see you.

536
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,740
You even cheated on her!

537
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,530
Scumbag!

538
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,700
It's good that

539
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,270
you came here.

540
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,400
Why did you have to bring

541
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,730
a gift here so politely?

542
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,930
Thank you for taking care of me that night.

543
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,000
You're welcome.

544
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,920
It was very easy to take care of you.

545
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,000
No matter what I asked you to do, you just did it.

546
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,530
You were very cooperative.

547
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,730
Even a three-year-old kid wouldn't be as obedient as you.

548
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,550
I'll go put away the gift.

549
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,070
You two can have a chat.

550
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,390
Have a chat.

551
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,090
I didn't expect that besides being drunk,

552
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,590
you would also talk a lot

553
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,840
when you get angry.

554
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,930
That man deserved to be scolded.

555
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,210
Right.

556
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,610
You know what? Every time Keke

557
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,140
and Grandma mentioned him,

558
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,030
they would scold him more severely than you did.

559
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,520
Are you serious?

560
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,330
What do you mean?

561
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,270
Were you really going to give Zhigang a chance,

562
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,170
or did you just give him a perfunctory answer so that he would leave?

563
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,910
He doesn't cherish you at all.

564
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,630
It was obvious that he wasn't sincere to ask you to get back together with him.

565
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,630
There will be tens of thousands of women like Weishan in the future.

566
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,760
You can't forgive him again and again.

567
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,270
He will only be more and more unscrupulous.

568
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,180
Don't give him a chance anymore.

569
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,080
Jiali.

570
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,720
You should care more about yourself.

571
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,340
If a person doesn't love himself well enough,

572
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,070
-how can he expect that others will...
-Alright!

573
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,400
It's late now.

574
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,880
Go home to sleep first.

575
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,160
But...

576
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,730
Don't interfere in the problem

577
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,060
between Zhigang and me.

578
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,290
Good night.

579
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,540
Don't be angry.

580
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,280
Li said something like that just because she was angry.

581
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,140
Forget it.

582
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,610
But it's late now.

583
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,100
Why don't you go back first?

584
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,160
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

585
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,390
Look at this kid.

586
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,010
Jiali.

587
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,140
I can't believe that Zhigang cheated on you.

588
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,870
Don't talk to him anymore.

589
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,760
Don't give him a chance anymore.

590
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,410
You should love yourself more.

591
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Did you hear that?

592
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,500
Jiali.

593
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,120
He just left without wearing his shoes?

594
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,670
Well...

595
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,420
What a big blow for him.

596
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,000
Hello, Mr. Wang.

597
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,530
I know.

598
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,460
I'll bring you the files of the information.

599
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,190
But it's better for you to have more rest.

600
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,610
Okay.

601
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,950
I'll ask Mr. Li's secretary to change the date.

602
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,230
Okay. That's it.

603
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,060
Bye.

604
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,230
Who is it?

605
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,860
Who's there?

606
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,800
Who is it?

607
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,820
Who's there?

608
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,410
I'm sorry.

609
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,000
I wasn't the one who killed you.

610
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,440
Don't come to me.

611
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,170
I'm sorry.

612
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,230
Don't come to me. Please.

613
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,870
I wasn't the one who killed you.

614
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,340
Don't come to me.

615
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,240
Please.

616
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,630
Don't come to me.

617
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,620
Chen Shi.

618
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,120
Keke?

619
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,770
I've been waiting for you for a very long time.

620
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,630
Why didn't you answer your phone?

621
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,950
I waited for so long that I fell asleep. I'm so tired.

622
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,480
Why are you sleeping here?

623
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,390
My mobile phone was in silent mode when I was in the hospital just now.

624
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,090
Later, I missed many calls.

625
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,520
I didn't reply one by one.

626
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,880
How is Haikuo?

627
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,190
Mr. Wang, how are you feeling?

628
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,730
I'm feeling much better.

629
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,960
That's good.

630
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,300
Can you help me

631
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,160
continue to pacify the colleagues of our company?

632
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,920
Sort out today's progress

633
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,780
and send it to me.

634
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,470
Okay.

635
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,080
Don't worry about work.

636
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,320
Well...

637
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,530
Keke...

638
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,200
I know.

639
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,030
I won't tell her or make her worry.

640
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,340
No.

641
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,150
You have to tell her that my condition is very bad.

642
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,150
I have no family to take care of me.

643
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,070
I don't eat the three meals regularly.

644
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,670
I don't care about my own health at all.

645
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,660
Anyway, describe me as a pitiful man.

646
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,810
What do you want to do?

647
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,110
I want to chase her.

648
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,580
So you're serious?

649
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,850
Mr. Wang, are you serious?

650
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,260
I'm sorry.

651
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,700
The doctor said...

652
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,960
The doctor said that...

653
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,570
his stomach ulcers almost led to perforation.

654
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,870
During this period,

655
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,270
he'll be on leave.

656
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,260
He'll stay at home to recuperate.

657
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,300
He lives alone.

658
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,400
I'm worried that he can't take good care of himself.

659
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,940
He was like this again this time.

660
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,000
For the order,

661
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,070
he kepting drinking alcohol with the clients.

662
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,150
He didn't refuse at all.

663
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,010
He was actually risking his life.

664
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,300
Is it that serious?

665
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:33,270
Then he'll need to take a few days off, won't he?

666
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,090
I don't think he'll be on leave for a long time.

667
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,889
He's very ambitious about work.

668
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,139
He'll take two or three days off at most.

669
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,989
Do you know his home address?

670
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,949
What do you want to do?

671
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,440
I want to show concern for him as his colleague.

672
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,199
You don't even like him.

673
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,940
Why do you show concern for him?

674
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,690
Does whether I like him or not

675
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,550
have anything to do with my concern for a colleague?

676
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,760
I'll give you a chance to tell me about it.

677
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,340
Otherwise,

678
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,540
someone will be very sad about

679
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,180
his socializing fees next month.

680
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,120
One or two months may not scare you.

681
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,870
How about

682
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,570
we start from

683
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,470
6 months?

684
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
[6 months*30,000 NT dollars per month=180,000 NT dollars]

685
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,670
What do you think?

686
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,080
Are you a bandit?

687
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,560
How is it? Just think about it.

688
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,560
That's more like it.

689
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,670
Thank you.

690
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,160
I think I saw Little Red Riding Hood

691
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,540
walking into the big wild wolf's forest.

692
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,880
Haikuo is a big shot of the Business Department.

693
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,840
Keke, how could you forget this?

694
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,600
Men in the Business Department

695
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,490
are very cunning.

696
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,700
I've heard that Wang Haikuo from the Business Department

697
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,100
has been sick and resting at home recently.

698
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,830
He seems to live alone.

699
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,200
I won't tell you about it.

700
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,990
Cousin,

701
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,190
I just want to go take care of Haikuo.

702
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,810
This is personal information.

703
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,600
I'll be fired if I tell you about it.

704
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,400
Don't worry.

705
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
I won't disclose to others that

706
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
it's you who tell me about it.

707
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,050
Dear cousin,

708
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,710
the whole world knows that I'm the HR manager.

709
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,360
But Cousin, just tell me about it.

710
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,280
No.

711
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,610
Don't you want me to marry a good man

712
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,970
and live a good life for the rest of my life?

713
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,040
Cousin,

714
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,460
have you forgotten?

715
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,370
I'll be 30 years old soon.

716
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,070
Women's best youthful time

717
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,600
will go far away from me soon.

718
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,820
If I still don't get married,

719
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,360
I'll have no chance.

720
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,560
Cousin, you don't even know how to cook.

721
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,510
How can you take care of a patient?

722
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,670
I can order takeout food.

723
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,540
Takeout food?

724
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,700
There is something wrong with his stomach.

725
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,540
If you really want to look after him,

726
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,940
you should cook for him.

727
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,840
Otherwise, how can you make him feel touched

728
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,100
and fall in love with you?

729
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
I...

730
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,760
I...

731
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,140
can cook.

732
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,150
I believe that

733
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,200
judging from my appearance,

734
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,910
you can sense that

735
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,440
I'm quite good at skin care.

736
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,320
But what you can't see is my inner self.

737
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,990
I'm very perfect.

738
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,180
I have a Class B chef license.

739
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,830
[Professional License]

740
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,420
That's not all.

741
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,050
This is a professional license from the Fitness and Sports Association.

742
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,990
[Professional License from the Fitness and Sports Association]

743
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,220
I can cook.

744
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
But I also know a lot

745
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,830
about household cleaning.

746
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,180
You probably can't imagine that

747
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,450
in the Asia

748
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,730
Household Cleaning Competition,

749
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,850
I ranked sixth.

750
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,050
Nurse practitioner?

751
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,880
I took the wrong one.

752
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,260
This is the right one.

753
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,720
[Household Cleaning Service License]

754
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,200
It's true.

755
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,090
Having a good environment

756
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,460
can help to improve both physical and mental health.

757
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,020
With good physical and mental health,

758
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,300
a person will naturally look energetic,

759
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,390
just like me now.

760
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,840
Don't tell me that in terms of Haikuo, you're also...

761
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,790
It's a secret that can't be said.

762
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,840
I never thought that my right hand

763
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,900
would be so strong.

764
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,110
I just patted

765
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,790
his shoulder gently,

766
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,360
but because of that, he had gastric perforation.

767
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,220
Actually, I...

768
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,680
Thank you.

769
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,960
Actually, I didn't want to hurt anyone.

770
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,480
But...

771
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,740
I really didn't do it on purpose.

772
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,780
Cousin.

773
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,650
Just

774
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,270
sympathize with us.

775
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,130
Tell us Haikuo's home address.

776
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,120
Okay?

777
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,440
Okay?

778
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,410
I really can't tell you.

779
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:48,910
But...

780
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,820
Cousin, please

781
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,340
Cousin, help us.

782
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,720
Please help us.

783
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,200
Take your hand away.

784
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,740
Cousin.

785
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,820
I want to get married.

786
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,660
Please.

787
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,700
Cousin.

788
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,410
Marry her off.

789
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,790
Please.

790
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,330
Miss.

791
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,940
Your takeout food has been delivered here.

792
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,160
Enjoy your meal.

793
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,240
What is this?

794
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,990
I asked your Uncle Jian to make mung bean soup for you.

795
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,520
Give us five stars in the rating if you like it.

796
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,990
What's wrong with you?

797
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,330
Well, you finally broke up with him.

798
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,220
But now...

799
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,460
He just said he needed me.

800
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,430
He just said he needed you.

801
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,800
When he needed you,

802
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,170
you could even give him your life.

803
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,440
But what about when you needed him?

804
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,240
Where was he?

805
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,110
Where was he?

806
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,120
You didn't see him at all.

807
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,470
Love is mutual.

808
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,690
It's not just about whether he needs you or not.

809
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,140
It's also about mutal affection

810
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,670
and cherishing each other.

811
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,410
Understand?

812
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,860
I understand.

813
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,360
I know what you mean.

814
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,620
But you also know me well.

815
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,800
I have an eagerness in my heart.

816
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,510
I'm eager that someone will need me.

817
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,290
I need you, too.

818
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,900
Why don't you love me more?

819
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,770
I won't spend your money.

820
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,820
I can even save money for you,

821
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,080
and make money for you.

822
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,230
Please focus more

823
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,860
on yourself. Okay?

824
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,940
I've been trying hard to do that.

825
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,970
I really don't understand you.

826
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,840
When other people are in a relationship,

827
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,610
they feel delighted and happy.

828
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,430
When you were in a relationship,

829
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,690
did you feel delighted?

830
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,750
Did you feel happy?

831
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,650
Have some mung bean soup.

832
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,890
Do you have a spoon?

833
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,820
No.

834
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,040
Gosh.

835
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,210
The appointment with Mr. Li

836
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,290
can be scheduled for next Monday.

837
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,420
I've found out about his preferences.

838
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,150
We need to prepare a gift.

839
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,550
I'll send it to you later.

840
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,970
You have to book a table at the restaurant.

841
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,370
Just book a western-style meal.

842
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,050
Okay. That's all. Bye.

843
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,760
Hello.

844
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,890
Keke?

845
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,290
Is anybody there?

846
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,610
Hi.

847
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,630
Hi.

848
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,820
Are you going out?

849
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,720
No, I was

850
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,200
handling the business,

851
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,890
so I didn't hear the doorbell.

852
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,770
I mean, when you're at home,

853
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,350
you're still wearing such a

854
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,750
formal suit.

855
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,930
I didn't specially dress up.

856
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,650
May I come in?

857
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,990
I think you must be busy with work

858
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,040
and have no time to eat,

859
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,660
so I'm here to prepare some food for you.

860
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,820
The products of the supermarket around your home are really cheap.

861
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,800
The vegetables, meat

862
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,770
and these ingredients I brought

863
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,430
cost less than 300 NT dollars.

864
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,590
Why are you doing this?

865
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,300
I'm here to show concern for my colleague.

866
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,800
If you need anything, just ask me to help you.

867
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,040
If there's nothing else, just get back to work

868
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,700
and pretend that I'm not here.

869
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,080
Wait.

870
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,130
What are these things?

871
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,490
A cotton blanket and a sleeping bag.

872
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,190
Are you going to live at my home?

873
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,040
May I?

874
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:57,970
[Preview]

875
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,060
We've broken up with each other.

876
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,550
I don't need your protection.

877
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,940
It's all because of you, an irrelevant person,

878
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,900
who has been pestering Jiali

879
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,230
and can't be driven away, just like a fly.

880
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,410
I'm not an irrelevant person.

881
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,670
I like Jiali.

882
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,230
Keke will

883
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,050
definitely get off work on time today.

884
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,410
Keke usually works overtime at this time.

885
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,970
I have to leave first today.

886
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,370
There must be something wrong with Keke.

887
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,240
I've decided

888
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,200
to tail Keke after work today.

889
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:21,960
Let me help you.

890
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:23,260
Don't move.

891
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,720
The temperature of your hand is just right.

892
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,160
Or is it because you have a crush on me?
