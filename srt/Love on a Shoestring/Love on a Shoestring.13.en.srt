[Love on a Shoestring]

3
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,289
I've decided

4
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:18,800
to continue to walk on this path.

5
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,390
[Episode 13]

6
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,800
No matter how hard it is

7
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,480
and no matter what the cost is,

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,210
I will take your dream

9
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,450
as my most important mission.

10
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,030
I will work hard

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,610
to accomplish the mission.

12
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,580
I'll never compromise.

13
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,039
I'll never give up easily.

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,710
Did you drink?

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,090
No.

16
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,070
What I just said is true.

17
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,250
The weather is so nice today.

18
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,450
But we're going home.

19
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,440
The coffee is delicious.

20
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,310
Listen, this rest station

21
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,170
is the most famous for its coffee.

22
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,020
Elly,

23
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,950
you're awake.

24
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,260
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,030
There are not too many people in the bathroom now.

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,990
You don't have to queue up.

27
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,420
That's right.

28
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,260
Also, you've been sleeping

29
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,490
all the way.

30
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,550
Are you that tired?

31
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,660
That's right. You said you are a light sleeper.

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,990
Michael Zhao was overtaken just now,

33
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,210
and we almost had a car accident.

34
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,140
He performed sudden braking,

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,520
but you still didn't wake up.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,720
You're a heavy sleeper,

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,360
just like me.

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,250
That's right. You slept soundly.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,470
Elly, why are you ignoring us?

40
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,320
Yeah, what are you looking at?

41
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,980
She's asleep.

42
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,920
Asleep?

43
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,850
No, her eyes are open.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,310
No. Listen.

45
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,450
She's snoring.

46
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,400
She's sleeping with her eyes open.

47
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,130
She really is asleep.

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,430
I can't believe someone sleeps with eyes open.

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,490
She's not a fish.

50
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,470
Shut up. I'm sleeping.

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,200
Your eyes are wide open.

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,829
Who knows you're sleeping?

53
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,829
Where is my eyeshade?

54
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,820
My eye...

55
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,050
-My eyeshade.
-Your eyeshade fell off.

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,920
Elly,

57
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,530
I didn't know

58
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,940
you have this kind of super power.

59
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,970
I can't believe you can sleep with your eyes open.

60
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,190
No wonder you always wear an eyeshade when you sleep.

61
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,870
That's right.

62
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,700
If I could sleep with my eyes open,

63
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,150
I wouldn't have gotten caught by my teachers

64
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,700
when I dozed off in class.

65
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,690
Yes.

66
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,430
Listen.

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,730
You can consider being a security guard working on the night shift.

68
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,180
You can do this when you work.

69
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,240
Right? You can sleep.

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,530
You won't get caught.

71
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,140
Also, you can make money.

72
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,340
It's great!

73
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,650
Yes.

74
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,430
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,830
We are talking about Elly.

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,420
She was sleeping with her eyes open just now.

77
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,880
She was like this just now.

78
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,970
What's so funny about sleeping with eyes open?

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,890
Who said we have to sleep with eyes closed?

80
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,560
As long as we feel comfortable and can fall asleep,

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,760
sleeping with eyes open is fine, right?

82
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,880
We should be ourselves

83
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,350
and have our own ideas.

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,659
We shouldn't be restricted

85
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,659
by worldly rules.

86
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,990
Is he scolding us?

87
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,590
Yeah, why is he so serious?

88
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,570
Yeah.

89
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,620
I think you have your own style.

90
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,640
You're very different when you're asleep compared to when you're awake.

91
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,540
Sleeping with your eyes open...

92
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,200
How should I put it?

93
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
I think...

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,660
it makes you a little cute.

95
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,470
What's wrong?

96
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,430
Elly.

97
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,010
Elly.

98
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,120
Elly.

99
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,560
Is she going to the bathroom?

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,330
Elly!

101
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,140
I don't know.

102
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,510
Is she angry?

103
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,280
I think she's going to the bathroom.

104
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,050
I don't know.

105
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,860
Did we go too far?

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,850
We can buy three and get one free there.

107
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,340
Didn't I tell you to wait in the car?

108
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,340
You can text me if you need anything.

109
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,490
I'm worried you'll suffer losses,

110
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,220
so I came to be your supervisor.

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
There really is nothing

112
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,000
that can stop your persistence in saving money.

113
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,120
If you don't like it, I'll leave.

114
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,750
Why would I not like it?

115
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,680
Because we

116
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,040
have different values.

117
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,380
We can't like each other

118
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,580
just because we have different values?

119
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,400
We can like each other,

120
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,570
but we won't be happy together.

121
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,520
Whether we can be happy together

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,610
doesn't depend on if we have the same values.

123
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,870
It depends on if we can reach a consensus.

124
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,390
If we can't reach a consensus...

125
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,290
If our love is deep enough,

126
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,850
even if we can't reach a consensus,

127
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,790
we'll be willing to change ourselves for each other

128
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,590
and compromise with each other.

129
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,340
Even if it's a disadvantage,

130
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,180
it'll become an advantage.

131
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,850
So just because

132
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,400
I gave you a bottle of milk when we were little,

133
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,870
you think my shortcomings are advantages?

134
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,990
I didn't fall in love with you

135
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,520
because of a bottle of milk.

136
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,190
It just made me remember you.

137
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,460
So I was very curious

138
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,930
about what you've become like after so many years.

139
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,140
I didn't expect...

140
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,820
You didn't expect what?

141
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,690
I didn't expect...

142
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,260
you really are very special.

143
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,510
You're still innocent and kind.

144
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,750
You're not stingy.

145
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,690
You're just better at cherishing things than anyone else.

146
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,470
I really like

147
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,470
the way you are.

148
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,360
After hearing what you said,

149
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,910
it seems I'm a really nice person.

150
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,240
Why am I so outstanding?

151
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,320
Now I've reached a consensus with you.

152
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,000
A consensus?

153
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,590
What do you mean?

154
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,450
I mean...

155
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,210
Jian Keke.

156
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,090
Switch the cars.

157
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,180
Switch... Switch the cars?

158
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,880
Switch the cars, now.

159
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,330
Well,

160
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,320
you enjoyed a comfortable ride in Michael Zhao's car.

161
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,400
Why do you suddenly want to switch the cars?

162
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,730
I... I can't

163
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,770
sit in the same car with him now.

164
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,920
I...

165
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,660
can't...

166
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
get close to him.

167
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,790
I'm about to lose myself!

168
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,330
-No!
-Elly.

169
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,840
Calm down first.

170
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,560
Take a deep breath.

171
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,290
Yes.

172
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,920
Why do you suddenly hate Michael Zhao so much?

173
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,490
He's smug

174
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,290
and a little annoying,

175
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,570
but he's not that annoying.

176
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,640
He's a nice guy.

177
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,620
Are you deaf?

178
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,590
I said

179
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,490
I can't stay in the same space with him.

180
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,490
Okay.

181
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,290
Elly!

182
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,250
So you are here.

183
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,230
I've been looking for you.

184
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,270
Elly.

185
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,580
Elly,

186
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,060
where did you go?

187
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,430
I've been looking for you.

188
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,290
Elly,

189
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,590
stop running, okay?

190
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,300
Elly.

191
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,570
Elly.

192
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,530
Elly, are you okay?

193
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,100
Elly.

194
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,230
Elly.

195
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,510
Are you okay?

196
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,040
Go away!

197
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,740
-Elly!
-Go away!

198
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,760
Elly!

199
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,340
You pervert!

200
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,030
Seize him!

201
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,290
You pervert!

202
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,200
What did you do?

203
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,000
We all know each other.

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,980
We all know each other.

205
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,040
Know what?

206
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,970
Call the police!

207
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,170
Call the police! Hurry!

208
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,540
It's good that you found her.

209
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,960
Continue to comfort her.

210
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,410
I'm still at the police station.

211
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,750
Bye bye.

212
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,840
So? Has the problem been solved?

213
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,800
Finally, we can go home.

214
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,050
Where is Michael Zhao?

215
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,940
What's wrong with him?

216
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,180
Are you okay?

217
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,040
Leave me alone.

218
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,750
Right now,

219
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,850
it's more suitable for me to stay in such a shabby corner.

220
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:03,930
It's okay.

221
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,410
You were just taken into the police station.

222
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,540
I really didn't do anything.

223
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,720
At least I touched you last time.

224
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,360
I didn't do anything this time.

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,410
I even smiled at her.

226
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,050
Let's...

227
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,590
go back first.

228
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,220
About you and Elly,

229
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,930
we'll figure out a way later.

230
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,060
I can't go back.

231
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,560
This is my first time in a police station.

232
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,170
I'm so scared that my legs are weak.

233
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,610
I can't go home now.

234
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,230
Help me up.

235
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,440
Thank you for driving me home.

236
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,460
You're welcome.

237
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,990
I'm getting off then.

238
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,610
I'm really leaving.

239
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,200
Bye bye.

240
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,100
Bye bye.

241
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,410
Jian Keke.

242
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,790
You...

243
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,720
didn't finish your words today, right?

244
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,890
Is there anything I haven't said?

245
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,860
Yes.

246
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,480
You said,

247
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,180
"After hearing what you said,

248
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,740
it seems I'm a really nice person and very outstanding.

249
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,270
Now we've reached a consensus."

250
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,240
I said,

251
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,780
"A consensus?

252
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
What do you mean?"

253
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,670
You said,

254
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,330
"I mean..."

255
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,690
Jian Keke!

256
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,440
Then Elly showed up.

257
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,490
You... have a really good memory.

258
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,970
Yes.

259
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,990
So,

260
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,730
what did you want to say?

261
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,040
I...

262
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,000
I did

263
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,190
want to tell you something.

264
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,200
But after Elly and Michael Zhao showed up,

265
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,570
I forgot.

266
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,790
If I can remember it,

267
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,910
I'll tell you.

268
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,390
Okay.

269
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,040
Take your time.

270
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm leaving. Bye bye.

271
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,420
I'll tell you immediately

272
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,500
when I remember it.

273
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,420
Okay.

274
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,090
Bye bye.

275
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,190
If you know

276
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,490
what I want to tell you,

277
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,900
I think you'll be very surprised.

278
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,240
What surprise?

279
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,690
Why are you here?

280
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,120
This is my home.

281
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,670
Is it weird for me to be here?

282
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,060
I mean...

283
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,740
why you didn't make a sound.

284
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,730
You two were chatting.

285
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,310
Who am I to interrupt you?

286
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,970
Let me ask you.

287
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,730
What surprising thing do you want

288
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,880
to tell Haikuo?

289
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,850
No.

290
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,110
No surprising thing.

291
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,990
No.

292
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,930
Absolutely no.

293
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,910
You are my daughter.

294
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,950
I know what you're thinking.

295
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,720
You can't hide it from me.

296
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,050
Judging from your current facial expression,

297
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,730
obviously,

298
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,190
something makes you very happy.

299
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,970
Right?

300
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,450
Because I'm happy

301
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,850
that I came back to my warm home.

302
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,200
I haven't eaten since I left the police station.

303
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,810
-I'm starving.
-You still haven't eaten?

304
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,880
At this hour?

305
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,090
Ask your mother to heat up the dinner.

306
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,220
Honey.

307
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,260
I'm back.

308
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,250
Thank you.

309
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,400
Why are you here?

310
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,240
It's your day off today.

311
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm here for you.

312
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,680
Have you thought about

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,210
the request

314
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,450
I made that day?

315
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,970
I

316
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,080
have done this before.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,920
I had a few experiences.

318
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,490
But those experiences were not good.

319
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,060
But I will make you satisfied.

320
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,270
Now you're the only one

321
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,990
who is willing

322
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,300
to do it with me one-to-one.

323
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,670
Give me some more time to think about it.

324
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,590
It's okay.

325
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,810
Take your time.

326
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,010
Well,

327
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm leaving then.

328
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,280
Bye bye.

329
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,580
Bye bye.

330
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,440
You don't like Yuanchong, right?

331
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,700
Why did you seduce him?

332
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,850
Have you misunderstood?

333
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,100
He just asked me to teach him how to make desserts.

334
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,470
D...

335
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,400
Desserts?

336
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,650
He knows my dream

337
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,260
is to open my own bakery.

338
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,450
So he signed up for baking classes.

339
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,150
But he was advised to quit by his teacher.

340
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,280
Now he wants me to teach him in private.

341
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,260
I see.

342
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,610
I thought you were flirting with him

343
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,070
and giving him promises.

344
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,770
No.

345
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,370
I think

346
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,630
I really should

347
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,070
refuse him directly.

348
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,430
Refuse?

349
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,970
Why do you want to refuse him?

350
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,970
If he wants to learn, just teach him.

351
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,850
He wants to learn baking

352
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,030
just to help me make my dream come true.

353
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,020
If I agree to teach him,

354
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,460
it'll be like I'm giving him a chance.

355
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,240
Do you like chocolate?

356
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,730
Yes.

357
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,410
But I don't like it.

358
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,910
So?

359
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,980
What do you mean?

360
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,090
I don't like chocolate,

361
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,190
but it's my job

362
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,880
to put chocolate on the shelf.

363
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,760
Likewise,

364
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,100
Yuanchong asked you to teach him.

365
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,960
You'll be helping him if you agree to teach him.

366
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,190
He wants to learn baking

367
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,370
because he likes you.

368
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,360
That's his business.

369
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,890
It has nothing to do with you.

370
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,990
He likes me, so it has something to do with me.

371
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,300
Why is it his business?

372
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,690
He likes you.

373
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,920
That's his emotional problem.

374
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,680
He has hope and expectations,

375
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,220
but if he still can't make you fall in love with him

376
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,620
after you teach him how to do it,

377
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,370
he'll have to bear the consequences himself.

378
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,770
You shouldn't be blamed.

379
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,580
So you also think she has unique thoughts, right?

380
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,580
It's not because I have old-fashioned values, right?

381
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,870
Indeed, her thoughts are a little unique.

382
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,270
But she's right.

383
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,890
Your love for someone

384
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,460
has nothing to do with others

385
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,520
as long as it doesn't disturb others.

386
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,100
I don't think I can be like Qianqian,

387
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,560
who can clearly distinguish

388
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,160
between reason and emotion.

389
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,420
I don't think ordinary people can do that.

390
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,770
But don't you think it's better to be like her?

391
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,990
She doesn't get emotional easily.

392
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,190
In the face of problems,

393
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,850
she won't be as hesitant as me.

394
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,830
So, you haven't made your decision

395
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,290
on the matter concerning Yuanchong, right?

396
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,680
He has a very positive attitude.

397
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,770
I'm very touched.

398
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
It's just that...

399
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,580
That day, I saw something awful

400
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,720
outside the baking classroom.

401
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,830
To me,

402
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,280
baking is a very important dream.

403
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,980
Can you give me another chance?

404
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,540
Please don't force me, okay?

405
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,480
It's good to have a dream.

406
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,250
But just make it a dream.

407
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,770
Please give up, okay?

408
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,310
Why don't you

409
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,760
agree to teach him first

410
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
to see if he

411
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,690
really doesn't cut out for baking?

412
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,520
I think you have a point.

413
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,830
Sun Jiali.

414
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,360
I have something to tell you.

415
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,790
What is it?

416
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,390
Last time, you said

417
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,260
the South Pole and the North Pole are actually the same.

418
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
They're both covered in ice.

419
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,820
So I want to say

420
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,990
the difference is not that big

421
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,950
like that between the equator and polar regions.

422
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,870
So I...

423
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,800
Can you just get to the point?

424
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,240
I've decided to confess my love to Haikuo.

425
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,960
Really?

426
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,920
Tomorrow?

427
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,290
Or today?

428
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,400
Or are we going now?

429
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,940
What's the rush?

430
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,020
Finally, Jian Keke is going to be in a relationship.

431
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,840
We must come up with

432
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,290
a very good plan.

433

[Business Department]

434
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,660
Make an appointment with Mr. Chen for me this afternoon.

435
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,230
We need to discuss the content of the contract.

436
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,720
Okay.

437
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,490
What's wrong?

438
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,890
I heard that you haven't had breakfast because of a meeting.

439
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,570
Here.

440
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,410
Buy one and get one free.

441
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,500
Thank you.

442
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,450
My mom asked you

443
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,140
if you have time to come over for dinner tonight.

444
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,460
Tonight?

445
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,720
If you don't have time tonight,

446
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,590
you can come tomorrow night.

447
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,260
If you don't have time tomorrow night,

448
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,050
you can come the night after tomorrow.

449
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,710
If it's still not okay,

450
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,590
you can come in the evening in three days.

451
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,760
I can come tonight.

452
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,690
Then see you tonight.

453
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,130
Why was Keke's reaction...

454
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,400
so big?

455
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,900
She avoided you before,

456
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,930
but now she has invited you to her house for dinner.

457
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,590
Are you very surprised?

458
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,010
It's just as I expected.

459
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,220
It's just as you expected?

460
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,650
Do you think the reason for Elly's abnormal behavior

461
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,610
is that she fell in love with someone

462
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,810
in the secret forest?

463
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
Where did the love come from?

464
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,930
Alright. Well, Mr. Lin,

465
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,080
see you next week.

466
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,110
By-Bye.

467
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,450
Give last month's receipts to me now.

468
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,710
Otherwise, you can't get the money back.

469
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,090
I...

470
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,650
I'll get them for you right now.

471
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,310
You always delayed doing this every month,

472
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,080
but you complained that the money was transferred to you quite slowly.

473
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,410
In that case, it’s hard for me to handle it.

474
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,410
Katy, let’s go.

475
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,710
Okay.

476
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,660
Give them to me as soon as possible.

477
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,920
It's gone?

478
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,870
The theme song is gone.

479
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,460
Your noodles will be ready soon.

480
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,280
-Okay.
-I'm giving you more vegetables today.

481
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,680
Okay. Thank you, Ma'am.

482
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,690
I have to rely on you when I have little money left at the end of every month.

483
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,720
You're welcome. You're a regular customer.

484
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,620
Thank you.

485
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,230
It's the end of the month. I can't eat an expensive meal.

486
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,630
I can only make do with it.

487
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,820
Hello.

488
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,210
Hello, Ma'am.

489
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,530
I want a bowl of noodles with soybean paste,

490
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,200
and a plate of boiled vegetables.

491
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,080
Then give me a portion of shredded dried bean curd salad

492
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,990
and a portion of preserved eggs and tofu.

493
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,620
Okay.

494
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,680
Please take a seat over there for a while.

495
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,610
Okay. Thank you.

496
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,150
Excuse me. Please step aside.

497
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,570
It looks like she really didn't recognize me.

498
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,250
Dressing style is really important indeed.

499
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,270
Here are your side dishes.

500
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,030
Thank you.

501
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,550
Miss, the food you've just ordered

502
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,250
costs 295 NT dollars in total.

503
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Please pay first.

504
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,720
Sure.

505
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,670
Where should I scan?

506
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,060
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,120
We only accept cash here.

508
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,990
Then wait for me.

509
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,040
I'll go get some cash from the ATM for you now.

510
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,780
Wait for me.

511
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,220
I wonder whether she's really going to get some cash from the ATM

512
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,370
or run away.

513
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,720
Ma'am.

514
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,800
How much does she need to pay?

515
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,470
It's 295 NT dollars in total.

516
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,050
I'll pay for her.

517
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,300
You'll pay for her?

518
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,550
Okay. I'll give you the change later.

519
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,150
Thank you.

520
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:04,890
Thank you.

521
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,320
What's going on now?

522
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
If the balance of the bank account is no more than 1,000 NT dollars,

523
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,510
does it mean that the account holder doesn't deserve to withdraw the money?

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,490

526
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,390
It's all because of Michael Zhao

527
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,680
who made me spend money on the taxi yesterday.

528
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,810
Now I only have 300 NT dollars' cash.

529

Ma'am, I'd like to pay the bill.

530
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,920
No need. Someone has paid the bill.

531
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,470
Who has paid it?

532
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,820
A kind man.

00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,950
A kind man?

Am I so beautiful that

535
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,330
a man was willing to pay for me

536
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,280
after taking just a glance at me?

537
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,190
Mrs. Jian.

538
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,780
You've prepared a lot of food today.

539
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,150
Of course there should be a lot of food today.

540
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,320
Last time when Haikuo came here,

541
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,790
he only had congee and side dishes with us.

542
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,950
I felt so sorry.

543
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,000
So this time, we must have a big meal.

544
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,320
Thank you for your dinner, Mrs. Jian.

545
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,310
But

546
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,690
no matter what we eat,

547
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,990
as long as I can come here,

548
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,450
all the food is delicious.

549
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,110
So you mean

550
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,300
the canned food you ate when you came here last time

551
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,200
is as delicious as my specialities which I've made

552
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,760
personally this time?

553
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,380
Mom, what are you doing?

554
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm just kidding.

555
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,790
Look!

556
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,650
Look at him.

557
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,580
He was so scared that his face turned blue.

558
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,720
I know you were just being polite while saying that.

559
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,150
Let's eat.

560
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,670
Come on. Let's eat.

561
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,840

562
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,750
Let me remove the shell of a shrimp for you.

563
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,300
Come on.

564
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,440
Good. Awesome.

565
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,500
Here you are. Have some shrimps.

566
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,350
Eat more.

567
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,570
It's okay. I can do it myself.

568
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,560
I've removed the shell. Just eat it.

569
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,250
Thank you.

570
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,260
This brat entered my house

571
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,310
and wants to take Keke away from me.

572
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,430
No way!

573
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,750
Honey.

574
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,590
I want shrimps, too. Remove the shells of shrimps for me.

575
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,600
Jian Fuyun!

576
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,510
I'm talking to you.

577
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,260
Why are you staring at Haikuo all the time?

578
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,900
Am I?

579
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,850
Aren't you?

580
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,840
I...

581
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,590
What's wrong with you?

582
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,510
When Haikuo came here last time,

583
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,480
you were against him all the time while he was talking.

584
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,160
When he's here this time,

585
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,190
you've been staring at him.

586
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,120
Let me tell you.

587
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,990
If you scare him away,

588
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,520
I won't let you off.

589
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,640
No, Mrs. Jian.

590
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,040
Your cooking is so good.

591
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,800
I won't be willing to run away.

592
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,200
You're so sweet.

593
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,020
You also look handsome.

594
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,710
Awesome!

595
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,500
Mr. Jian.

596
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,180
Well, for the cakes I'm going to sell at the bazaar,

597
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,980
can you help me borrow a venue for baking the cakes?

598
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,830
No problem.

599
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,890
I'll help you borrow the venue.

600
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,020
Okay. Thank you.

601
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,630
Do you want to join us?

602
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,750
Sure. Count me in.

603
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,960
Why do you want to go?

604
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,910
He can't do anything.

605
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,070
He can learn if he can't help.

606
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,790
Jiali is busy enough.

607
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,670
You'll bring trouble to her if you go, won't you?

608
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,420
It's enough.

609
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,110
Is it enough?

610
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,110
Honey, it's enough.

611
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,170
Have some shrimps.

612
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,450
I don't want them.

613
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,790
That's too much.

614
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,090
You're quite blind.

615
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,320
Why... Why do you think I'm blind?

616
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,620
You're super blind.

617
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:09,940
Here you are.

618
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,860
It's enough.

619
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,550
Will you die if you don't talk?

620
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,900
You've talked too much.

621
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,270
Shut up now!

622
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,330
Just shut up!

623
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,860
Yes!

624
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,120
Yes!

625
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,820
Obviously, my fingers are very flexible.

626
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,450
Why can't I make a cake?

627
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,480
I was playing a game just now.

628
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,270
So...

629
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,340
My fingers got too stiff because of it.

630
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,400
I was just trying to relax my fingers.

631
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,180
Recently, I've been preparing for the bazaar.

632
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,100
Therefore, I want to take this chance to teach you how to make desserts.

633
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,360
Do you think it's okay?

634
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,740
Okay.

635
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,820
It's okay for me.

636
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:05,600
Alright.

637
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,890
Let me make it clear first.

638
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,550
I've never taught anyone how to make desserts,

639
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,950
so I don't know whether I can teach you well.

640
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,060
It's all right.

641
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,820
Just focus on making the desserts by my side.

642
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,050
I'll take notes.

643
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,210
Then I'll try making them by your side.

644
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,120
Okay.

645
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Anyway, you can ask me anytime while I'm teaching you.

646
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,560
Thank you for being willing to teach me.

647
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,750
I'll learn the skills carefully.

648
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,880
I won't let you down.

649
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Yes!

650
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,450
[Trendee, Accounting Department]

651
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,990
Today, Elly is not here again?

652
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,700
Yeah, I've sent her a message,

653
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,850
but she didn't reply after reading it.

654
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,380
Let me send her a message. I think she'll reply to me.

655
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,510
It's been a few days.

656
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,210
What on earth happened to her?

657
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,690
What happened at the rest station that day?

658
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,040
Is it because of Michael Zhao?

659
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,130
You were there that day, weren't you?

660
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,730
Didn't Michael Zhao

661
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,470
just smile at her?

662
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,050
He didn't just smile at her.

663
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,120
Didn't you hear

664
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,080
Michael Zhao saying that Elly was sleeping with her eyes open

665
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,410
and she looked very cute?

666
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,600
Then Elly got out of the car in a panic.

667
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,300
That's right. Because of Elly,

668
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,989
we were criticized by Michael Zhao.

669
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:10,750
Yes.

670
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,760
No wonder she made such a big fuss

671
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,820
when she couldn't find her eyeshade.

672
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,710
Why are you eavesdropping on our conversations?

673
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,120
I'm not eavesdropping on your conversations.

674
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,719
I've been standing right here.

675
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,330
And you two even

676
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,090
talked to me just now.

677
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:22,750
I was...

678
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,070
Don't tell anyone about it.

679
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,630
Elly really minds it.

680
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,960
But...

681
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,389
when you were joking with Elly,

682
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,679
she didn't seem to mind it.

683
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,350
However, when Michael Zhao spoke up for her,

684
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,520
she overreacted.

685
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,330
That's right.

686
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,590
Isn't it a bit strange?

687
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,690
It's a bit strange indeed.

688
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,550
But

689
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,560
Elly won't be

690
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,690
influenced by Michael Zhao, will she?

691
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:42,929
You're right.

692
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:45,980
Elly is here.

693
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,030
Where is she?

694
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,300
She went to the Business Department.

695
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,630
Why did she go to the Business Department?

696
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,830
She's going to propose to Haikuo?

697
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,440
Whatever. Let's go.

698
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,040
I'm sorry, but I can't accept your proposal.

699
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,490
I have

700
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,190
no feelings for you.

701
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,390
It's all right.

702
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,340
We can get married first, and then fall in love with each other.

703
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,730
But let me tell you.

704
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,910
If you reject me,

705
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,430
you will suffer great losses.

706
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,960
Elly has never taken a look at me

707
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,010
since she entered the Business Department.

708
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,810
I think she really didn't recognize me yesterday.

709
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,710
What do you mean by getting married first and then falling in love?

710
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,170
I know what you want to say.

711
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,290
You think that

712
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,350
marriage should be a combination of love for two people.

713
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:52,960
Right?

714
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,060
No.

715
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,270
Marriage depends on reality.

716
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,430
It's about the consideration of interests.

717
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,090
It's the science of eugenics.

718
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,590
This is my health report.

719
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,540
This is the gene test for my ova.

720
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,860
Trust me.

721
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,300
I'm the only top choice for eugenics.

722
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,230
Is there anything wrong with you?

723
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,530
Marriage is based on

724
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,130
the love between two people.

725
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,860
You only care about conditions and eugenics.

726
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,050
This is called a transaction, not marriage.

727
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,070
Please find someone else.

728
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,250
Don't harass Haikuo.

729
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,210
Jian Keke, I'm pursuing my own happiness.

730
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,830
Why are you interrupting here?

731
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,490
I just want to interrupt.

732
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,410
Because what you pursue is the happiness of wealth.

733
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,820
You don't really love Wang Haikuo sincerely.

734
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,620
You're right.

735
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,890
I want to marry Haikuo

736
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,130
because he is rich.

737
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,570
What's wrong with that?

738
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,750
Who says that

739
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,730
marriage should be based on love?

740
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,170
Everyone has different values about money.

741
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,510
I invested in my beautiful appearance.

742
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,720
Those men who take me out

743
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,920
can be envied by other men.

744
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,950
[Division Three]

745
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,270
Since they want to be envied by other men,

746
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,770
they should pay for my beauty.

747
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,040
I want to turn money

748
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,900
into what I like.

749
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,420
What's wrong with that?

750
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,690
Is it really right

751
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,700
to save money in the bank like you do?

752
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,200
Well said!

753
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,490
What you said is awesome!

754
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,420
That's what a truly smart and wise person

755
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,200
would say.

756
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,310
People like Elly

757
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,160
are the ones who really know how to spend money,

758
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,960
instead of being bound by money.

759
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,590
Elly, right?

760
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,640
Haikuo, what do you think?

761
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,000
I think...

762
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,890
Thank you for your favor.

763
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,110
But between love and money...

764
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
I'll choose love.

765
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,040
So,

766
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,300
marriage should be based on affection.

767
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,370
It's okay.

768
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,040
We can date each other before we get married.

769
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,450
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

770
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,040
I'm not from a rich family.

771
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,490
I'm not a wealthy man, either.

772
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,690
I only own a heavy machine for my assets.

773
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,920
You don't have to lie in order to reject me.

774
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,600
What's there to lie about this?

775
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,590
I'm really not a wealthy man.

776
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,240
What a joke.

777
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,820
You're not from a rich family?

778
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,630
So you are

779
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,280
from a poor family?

780
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,920
My colleague told me you're here.

781
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,220
This is the men's washroom.

782
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,730
-Get out first.
-I need to talk to you.

783
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,560
It's urgent.

784
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,130
You'd better go inside the cubicle now

785
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,330
to check your injury.

786
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,720
What's the matter?

787
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,070
I want to have a blind date.

788
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,660
Didn't you say that you wouldn't have a blind date,

789
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,020
as it would degrade yourself?

790
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,940
This is a critical time.

791
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,990
For all the men whom you introduced to me previously,

792
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,490
like John, Steven, Peter and Mark,

793
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,700
they are all okay for me,

794
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,030
as long as they are rich.

795
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,250
What about your Wang Haikuo?

796
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,760
He's not from a rich family.

797
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,440
He's not from a rich family?

798
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,610
He said that in front of everyone,

799
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,010
and he even rejected my proposal.

800
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,710
He...

801
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,240
Wait.

802
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,880
He rejected your proposal

803
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,300
in front of so many people.

804
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,630
With your personality,

805
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,530
you're too calm now.

806
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,260
You're right.

807
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,610
I should have

808
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,790
cried sadly,

809
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,890
had a breakdown, roared, and refused to believe it.

810
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,460
But now I don't have any feelings at all.

811
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,470
I feel so calm just like...

812
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,450
Like what?

813
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,250
After eating a bucket of full-fat ice cream,

814
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,450
I'm still not afraid of gaining weight.

815
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,540
Have you thought about the reason?

816
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,770
Because I've found that

817
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,340
money no longer

818
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,150
ranks second in my mind.

819
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,110
Money

820
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,580
only ranks second?

821
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,300
Then what ranks first?

822
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,570
There's no need to ask.

823
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,810
Of course it's me.

824
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,470
This is the small object I use to relieve pressure.

825
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,600
I'll lend it to you to calm your nerves.

826
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,960
I'm not from a rich family.

827
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,480
Aren't you disappointed?

828
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,090
I'm quite disappointed.

829
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,190
Really?

830
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,630
I'm just kidding.

831
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,850
Though money is important to me,

832
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,900
I know that not everything can be bought with money.

833
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,620
For example,

834
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,960
you can buy people's support,

835
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,990
but you can't buy their sincerity.

836
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,660
Because sometimes,

837
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,560
we don't even know

838
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,920
what we are actually thinking.

839
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,320
And you can also spend money

840
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,220
buying sexual experience,

841
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,230
but you can never buy a soulmate.

842
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,360
And you can also spend a lot of medical expenses

843
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,300
buying...

844
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,230
Why are you looking at me like that?

845
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,480
I just think that...

846
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,600
after so many years,

847
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,500
many people and things have changed,

848
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,150
but only you

849
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,500
haven't changed at all.

850
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,850
I have to get back to work.

851
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,150
What are you doing? I have to get back to work.

852
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,070
The Accounting Department is downstairs.

853
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,410
Bye.

854
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,020
Keke!

855
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:31,840
Wait!

856
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,560
What?

857
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,540
Let me tell you.

858
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,990
I'm worried that you guys don't know how to use that oven.

859
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,280
I'll go with you to give you guys some guidance.

860
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,590
Jiali is a professional baker.

861
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,280
We won't have this problem.

862
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,080
Well, I'm not trying to blame Haikuo,

863
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,440
but he isn't coming to pick you up at this time.

864
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,790
It's faster if I send you there.

865
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,860
It's not that he doesn't want to come.

866
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,060
I told him not to come.

867
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,000
Look at you.

868
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,520
You're still covering it up for him.

869
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,890
That's what this kind of man is like.

870
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,130
He can't keep his promise.

871
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,260
His deeds are not consistent with his words.

872
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,970
No.

873
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,990
It's true that I told him not to come.

874
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,970
It's not that he doesn't want to come.

875
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,810
-Alright.
-Come on. Let me send...

876
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,940
No, go inside now.

877
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:02,750
The weather is very cold today.

878
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,330
Just go inside. Okay?

879
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:03,920
Go inside and take a rest.

880
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,050
-I have to go now.
-It's faster if I send you there.

881
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:05,660
Keke!

882
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,470
What?

883
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,350
It's the fastest if I go by myself.

884
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
I need to hurry up.

885
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,460
Why is it decorated like this?

886
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,520
Because today is an important day.

887
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,540
I remember what I want to tell you.

888
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,870
What do you want to tell me?

889
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:33,990
Wang Haikuo.

890
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:35,060
To me,

891
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,170
you're like the Temperate Marine Climate,

892
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,770
and you've always been warm.

893
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,850
Ever since I met you,

894
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,180
my life has become colorful and abundant.

895
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,350
I like you.

896
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,430
[Preview]

897
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,470
What's wrong with a girl confessing her love first?

898
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,450
If you love someone, you have to tell him.

899
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,500
You thief!

900
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,450
You did steal it!

901
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,450
-I really didn't steal it.
-You stole my...

902
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,850
What if he refuses?

903
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,350
There will always be some unexpected situations.

904
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,580
Now your persistence

905
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,610
has become a kind of pressure for me.

906
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,500
You want to confess your love to me?

907
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,770
Wang Haikuo,

908
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,700
I really like you.

909
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,910
This is the information you asked for.

910
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,280
Currently, he is a business manager in a small

911
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,300
and medium-sized enterprise.

912
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,170
Mr. Chairman, you can meet him anytime.

913
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,710
I won't let you go.
