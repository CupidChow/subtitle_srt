1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,800


2
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,553
   

3
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:49,600
   

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,980
I know you're about to get a divorce.

5
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,470
Sheng Mian,

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,190
I don't want to lose you again.

7
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,350
 Let go of her hand! 

8
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,450
It's not appropriate for Mr. Wen to grab the hands of a married woman.

9
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,400
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,300
Mr. Wen has done my wife a great favor.

11
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,560
As her husband, I should present my gratitude.

12
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,430
Excuse me. Three cups of coffee, please.

13
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,360
Sheng Mian never drinks coffee.

14
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,840
Tastes can sometimes change.

15
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,820
You guys continue talking.

16
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,840
I need to use the bathroom.

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,800
Let go of Sheng Mian.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,710
She's my wife.

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,280
She was my wife. She is my wife now.

20
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,320
And she will always be my wife.

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,240
You two are just in a mistaken and short-lived marriage.

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,280
She should never have married you.

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,990
Now, I'm back. I'm going to get her back on track.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,430
Dream on.

25
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,980
Sheng Mian only loves me.

26
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,560
You're already in the past.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,480
If you were that confident, you wouldn't be here.

28
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,160
How was your chat?

29
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,210
Mr. Wen and I had a good conversation.

30
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,120
We must have a drink together.

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,300
Don't bother. Wen Zhaoping doesn't like drinking.

32
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,130
What? Mr. Wen can't hold his liquor?

33
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,870
Well, since President Fu wants a drink so badly,

34
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,660
I'll accompany him.

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,010
   

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,250
Okay, President Fu.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,360
Sheng Mian, come home with me.

38
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,080
Don't even think about it.

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,140
Grandfather won't even let me in the house anymore.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,680
He's mad at me for breaking your heart.

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,710
He isn't even eating now.

42
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,080
If you don't care about me, at least think about Grandfather.

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,780
I was thinking that we could go to my home and video call Grandfather to pretend we're fine.

44
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,310
We can do the video call here.

45
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,800
Grandfather is so smart.

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,260
He won't believe us unless you come to my place.

47
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,500
Grandfather hasn't eaten all day.

48
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,320
Okay, but let's settle this now. I'm leaving as soon as the call is over.

49
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,840
No problem.

50
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,230
 Mian Mian, you can't be pretending to forgive Yancheng  

51
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,370
 just to make me happy, can you? 

52
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,920
Of course not, Grandfather. I forgave him long ago.

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,070
Grandfather, we're really back together.

54
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,480
- What's the matter? 
 - It's nothing, Grandpa.

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,560
We have a cat at home. It's playing with me.

56
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,900
Off you go.

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,920
All right.

58
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm relieved to see you guys like this.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,730
I'll come over for dinner sometime soon.

60
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,400
 Mian Mian, don't forget to visit me with Yancheng when you have some time. 

61
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,940
No problem, Grandfather. We have to go.

62
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,820
Bye-bye.

63
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,970
I'm leaving.

64
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,290
What? You cripple me and now you want to run away?

65
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,270
I don't mind actually breaking your leg.

66
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,530
All right.

67
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,480
If I break my leg, I'm not the one who's going to feel bad.

68
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,380
Don't give me that.

69
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,630
We agreed that I'd leave after the call with Grandfather.

70
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,290
Did we?

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,000
My head hurts. I drank too much.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,830
It's too much.

73
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,630
I knew you cared about me.

74
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,670
- Why does it taste so sour? 
 - Aren't you drunk?

75
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,210
Have a glass of vinegar to cure your hangover.

76
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,720
Don't you remember that you once said that?

77
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,500
Sheng Mian, don't leave.

78
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,560
What if Grandfather video calls to check up on us?

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,870
Don't talk about Grandfather.

80
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,190
He is not that bored.

81
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,480
Sheng Mian, I helped you at the shareholders' meeting,

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,720
so please stay with me one night.

83
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,770
I'll make this clear.

84
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,390
I'll take the bedroom. You sleep in the living room.

85
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,230
After tonight, we don't owe each other.

86
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,000
I saw a picture of you three years ago when you saved Grandfather.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It would've been great if we had known each other back then.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,120
Fu Yancheng, no one is going to wait for you. We can't go back now.

89
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,040
What about Wen Zhao?

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,680
Wen Zhao? He's a very important friend of mine.

91
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,630
I don't care about whoever Wen he is.

92
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm going to win you back.

93
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,110
Okay. I'll see you tonight, Director Zhao.

94
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,500
I just received an order from a big overseas customer.

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,480
Our KPI can be accomplished.

96
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,090
I'll meet them at their factory tonight.

97
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,120
That's great news.

98
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,900
But I have to go to a convention tonight, so I can't go with you.

99
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,390
It's okay. I'll go alone.

100
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,680
Take care of yourself.

101
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,920
Okay. Don't worry.

102
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,590
Hello.

103
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,270
Xiao Yang.

104
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,980
Sheng Mian, it's been a long time.

105
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,000
You put my sister through hell.

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,670
Today, I will make you pay for it.

107
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,320
You...

108
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,960
 Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be reached at the moment. 

109
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,160
 Please try again later. 

110
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,140
 Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be reached at the moment. 

111
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,540
 Please try again later. 

112
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,790
- Hello? 
  Is Sheng Mian with you? 

113
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,270
She went to see a big client.

114
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,200
What client?

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,390
It's an overseas company.

116
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,440
The company representative is called...

117
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,000
Xiao Yang.

118
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,320
Xiao Yang?

119
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,080
Oh no! Send me the address.

120
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,820
Let me go.

121
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,890
Let me go!

122
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,390
You can drink the wine you didn't finish last time.

123
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,480
If you make me happy today,

124
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,610
who knows? Maybe I'll go easy on you.

125
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,240
Xiao Yang,

126
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,670
if you hurt me today, watch out. Fu Yancheng will make you wish you were dead.

127
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,440
Would I be afraid of him?

128
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
Fu Yancheng is so heartless.

129
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,480
He destroyed my family.

130
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,770
Let's see what he'll do if I destroy his wife.

131
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:53,370


132
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,510
Can you fight?

133
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,550
Mind your own business.

134
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,920
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam

141
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,450

145
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,590
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫
