1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:16,030


2
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,800
   

3
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:48,311
   

4
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,519
Fu Yancheng.

5
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,359
Let's get a divorce.

6
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,820
We'll both live our own lives.

7
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,780
Live our lives separately.

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,979
No. Sheng Mian.

9
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,560
I can't divorce you.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,799
Please give me another chance.

11
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,959
Let's start over, okay?

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Please.

13
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:24,940
We're done.

14
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,960
♫  I can't forget you  ♫ 
  ♫  It's futile to worry about you  ♫

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,100
♫  You shake me when you appear  ♫

16
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,140
♫  I regard you as higher than the sky  ♫ 
 ♫  No one can replace you  ♫

17
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,280
♫  Is it a little ridiculous?  ♫

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,750
♫  The hug I once coveted  ♫

19
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,750
♫  I never had it for a second  ♫

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,220
♫  We continue to torment one another  ♫

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,850
♫  There is no passage to the future in this world  ♫

22
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,160
♫  Otherwise, it would have appeared before at the corner  ♫

23

32
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,450
♫  I never had it for a second  ♫

33
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,939
Aunt, I went shopping today and picked this out for you.

34
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,339
Open it and see if you like it.

35
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,280
Thank you.

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,020
From now on, I'll take good care of you with Yancheng.

37
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,000
Chuqing, has something happened between you two lately?

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,320
No? We're good.

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,420
Did Yancheng say something?

40
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,779
I don't know what happened to Yancheng.

41
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,580
He disliked Sheng Mian so much.

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,260
He was always talking about a divorce.

43
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,719
But a few days ago, he told me he'd never leave Sheng Mian.

44
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,939
When I probed further, he got angry with me.

45
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,919
That Sheng Mian, she's great at underhanded methods.

46
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,700
It's not the first or second time.

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,779
I bet she's been stirring things up between you and Yancheng.

48
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,820
How despicable.

49
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,260
Aunt, I came today to tell you something.

50
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,940
What?

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,759
I...

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,759
You... You are carrying Yancheng's kid?

53
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,160
 At this point, I have no choice but to take this risk. 

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,980
 As long as this hag helps me get Yancheng to divorce Sheng Mian, 

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,199
 I'm sure I can have Yancheng's baby. 

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,099
Can you not tell Yancheng yet?

57
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,580
I want to find the right moment to tell him myself.

58
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,539
All right, all right.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,900
But Sheng Mian keeps refusing to divorce Yancheng.

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm afraid that sooner or later everyone will know that I'm pregnant.

61
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,139
Don't worry. Leave that to me.

62
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,859
I called you here today to tell you

63
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,099
Xiao Chuqing is pregnant with the Fu family's child.

64
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:25,060
If you're sensible, you'd better divorce Yancheng now.

65
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,959
Why are you so sure her child is from the Fu family?

66
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,700
I can't be wrong.

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,940
That night at the Fu family's ball, Yancheng was with Chuqing.

68
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,360
A simple calculation would tell us that it was that night she got pregnant.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,120
If you hadn't occupied this spot in the Fu family,

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,100
he would have married Chuqing long ago.

71
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,020
Congratulations then, you'll be having your grandson soon.

72
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,099
Don't worry.

73
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:52,000
As long as your son divorces me, I won't interfere anymore.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You'd better keep your word.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,580
Don't try anything sneaky.

76
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,079
 Penny, I've already gotten the security footage from the day you got into trouble. 

77
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,020
 Xiao Chuqing. 

78
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:25,560
 I'll soon become the lady of this house. 

79
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,879
Why are you here?

80
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm the designer of this villa.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,500
So, why can't I be here?

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,399
You've lost Yancheng's child, which was also your biggest leverage.

83
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,140
I don't care if you're Penny or Sheng Mian.

84
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,959
Stay away from Yancheng, do you hear me?

85
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,659
Looks like you already know who I am.

86
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,639
I don't want that man anymore.

87
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,360
But you killed his child.

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
Do you think he'll let you off the hook?

89
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,959
It's just a child.

90
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,560
Just so you know,

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,880
I'm also pregnant with Yancheng's child.

92
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,099
Pregnant women sure have bad memories.

93
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:06,060
You can't even recall the real father of your kid.

94
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,120
Nonsense!

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,079
At the Fu family ball, the waiter...

96
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,439
You wouldn't have forgotten that so soon, right?

97
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,560
With modern technology, you can do a paternity test during pregnancy.

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm not pregnant!

99
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,720
Aunt, did you hear all that?

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
 Xiao Chuqing, 

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,739
 that night at the hotel, who were you really with? 

102
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,620
Aunt. Please, I can explain.

103
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,120
I...

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,623
 You dare to lie to me about this? 

105
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:36,680
Listen carefully.

106
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,360
You'll never marry into the Fu family!

107
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,739
You wretch!

108
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,959
How dare you plot against me!

109
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,399
Xiao Chuqing, enough!

110
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,000
You've schemed against Sheng Mian repeatedly.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,560
First, it was the ball.

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,379
Now, you caused her miscarriage.

113
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,140
How can you be so vicious?

114
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,399
Yancheng, don't you want to divorce her?

115
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,240
Everything I did was to help you!

116
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,680
Who said I want to divorce her?

117
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,399
I, Fu Yancheng, will never leave her.

118
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,079
Yancheng, she used Penny's identity to seduce you,

119
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,959
while hiding the fact that she's your wife.

120
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,700
Stop letting her fool you.

121
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,919
When did you find out that I was Sheng Mian?

122
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,439
At the Fu family's press conference.

123
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,279
Sheng Weiyuan came to see me, showing off and saying you were pregnant.

124
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,240
And she called me a mistress who was seducing her brother-in-law.

125
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,060
Wasn't all of this instigated by you?

126
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,179
 So, it was her. 

127
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:46,199
 So, Sheng Weiyuan intentionally dialed the wrong number for me to overhear. 

128
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,639
Yancheng, the women from the Sheng family are villainous!

129
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,139
- I'm the only one who truly loves you. 
 - Enough!

130
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,120
Xiao Chuqing.

131
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,859
I don't want to see you again.

132
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,199
Yancheng. Yancheng.

133
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,140
Yancheng!

134
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,360
Sheng Mian. Sheng Mian.

135
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,500
Sheng Mian, I really miss you.

136
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,779
These past few days, to let you recover well, I've held myself back from seeing you.

137
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,399
But the moment I close my eyes, all I see is your face.

138
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,160
Don't think that the help you just gave me will make me grateful to you.

139
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,439
You heartlessly interfered in the Sheng family's business

140
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,120
that caused my dad to fall ill and never recover.

141
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,100
From the moment my dad passed away, I gave up on you.

142
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,419
The only reason I stayed with you was to get you to divorce me.

143
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,120
Now that the child is gone,

144
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,420
there's no chance left for us.

145
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:59,770
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

146
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,340
I have never liked anyone.

147
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,080
You are the first.

148
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,200
You can hate me, curse me, or hit me when I make mistakes.

149
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,840
As long as you're happy and not leave me.

150
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,360
As long as we're together, we'll have children again.

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,819
How can we?

152
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,239
Like this?

153
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,200
I was wrong.

154
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,619
Don't do this, I'm begging you.

155
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,080
Isn't this what you like?

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,020
Isn't it all about mutual desire?

157
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,340
Isn't this how we started?

158
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,120
You're still recovering,

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,140
don't get too emotional.

160
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,559
Then let go of me.

166
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,340
Sister,

167
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,399
do you really plan not to forgive your husband?

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,139
Do you think I should forgive him?

169
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,200
After all, this is your personal matter.

170
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,299
As an outsider, it's not my place to judge.

171
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:06,180
However, no matter what your decision is, I will support you.

172
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,859
Wei Yuan, I'm so lucky to have a sister like you.

173
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,900
Sheng Mian.

174
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,459
What can I do to make you forgive me?

175
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,879
Do you need something?

176
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,559
Sheng Mian,

177
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
I miss you.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,139
You've drunk too much. Don't call me.

179
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,380
Sister, don't go home tonight. Stay here.

180
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,220
We haven't spent time together in so long.

181
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,879
I really miss how we used to chat under the covers.

182
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,619
All right.

183
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,400
Then I won't leave tonight.

184
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,879
 I want to see you. 

185
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,479
 Can I come find you now? 

186
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,459
 Okay. I'll wait for you. 

187
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:37,010

 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

189
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:50,990
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

190
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:58,380
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

191
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:05,900
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

192
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,610
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

193
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:20,260
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

194
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:27,930
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

195
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,720
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

196
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,490
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

197
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,310
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

198
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,920
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

199
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,980
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

200
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,750
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

201
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:59,180
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
