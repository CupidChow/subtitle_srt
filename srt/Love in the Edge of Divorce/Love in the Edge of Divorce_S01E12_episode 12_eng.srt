1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:11,040


2
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,509
   

3
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:48,390
   

4
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,239
President Fu, please put your clothes back on.

5
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,719
Oh?

6
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,359
How am I supposed to take a bath with my clothes on?

7
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,480
♫  Because of you, my life begins to have shadow and light  ♫

8
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,159
Or… were you secretly watching me just now?

9
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,759
Do you think I'm trying to seduce you?

10
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,180
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

11
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,690
♫  Watch the seasons turn and change  ♫

12
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,880
♫  Watch the rainstorms and the fog dissipate  ♫

13
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,950
♫  Watch the old moonlight fall into the palm of your hand  ♫

14
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:03,690
♫  Light up our new past... with you  ♫

15
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,750
♫   I hear you. I see you. I follow you  ♫

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:19,410
♫  Because of you, my life begins to have shadow and light  ♫

17
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,690
♫  Dreaming of you, thinking of you, loving you  ♫

18
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:33,130
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

19
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,100
♫  You are the only one I need  ♫

20
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,500
♫  You are the only one I want  ♫ 
  ♫  You are the only one I see  ♫

21
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,160
♫  You are the only one I dream  ♫

22
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,580
♫  You are the only one I need  ♫

23
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,119
You... You can't go upstairs!

24
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,520
Why can't I go upstairs?

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,039
I'm his mother.

26
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,040
That woman is blatantly living here in Yancheng's house now.

27
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,199
 Can I tolerate that? 

28
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,680
 Today, I'm definitely going to teach her a lesson. 

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
 President Fu is just working with her. 

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,919
 Do you think I'm a fool? 

31
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,439
 If it's just work, why would she stay here late into the night? 

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,759
 The project is urgent, and they haven't finished yet. 

33
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,000
 Why don't you come back tomorrow? 

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,360
 No. I must see who this designer is! 

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,160
 She's got Yancheng wrapped around her finger. 

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,100
Madam!

37
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,200
Flirt first and then you want to run away?

38
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,599
You clearly have feelings for me, too.

39
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,239
Otherwise, just now...

40
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,200
Just now, I was just...

41
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,899
Just what? Acting on impulse?

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,799
Here are the quarterly financial reports.

43
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,000
I've already had the accountant verify them. Please take a look.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 President Fu, you're here. 

45
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,840
President Fu, you're here.

46
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,879
President Fu, you came to see Penny. Right?

47
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,560
You two talk. I have other matters to attend to.

48
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,240
President Fu, let's talk in my office.

49
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,639
Right here is fine.

50
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,680
I...

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,879
The documents are in my office.

52
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,720
What are you nervous about?

53
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,460
Don't do this. He could come back at any moment.

54
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,399
You care about him that much?

55
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,839
I...

56
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,410
♫  After all, there are too many beautiful memories  ♫

57
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:27,000
♫  There is nothing worse than now  ♫

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,710
♫  Blame me. It's not your necessity  ♫ 
 ♫  I can't control our huge distance well  ♫

59
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,199
 Penny, what was that noise just now? 

60
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,959
 Are you okay? 

61
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,399
I'm fine.

62
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,059
 Good to hear. I'll be going, then. 

63
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,639
I just didn't want him to misunderstand.

64
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,179
I...

65
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,120
♫  The hug I once coveted  ♫

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,040
Penny,

67
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm willing to wait for you to divorce him.

68
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,439
You clearly have feelings for me, too.

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Penny.

70
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,800
Penny.

71
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,739
- Penny, where are you going? I'll give you a ride. 
 - No need, President Fu.

72
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,480
I didn't expect Fu Yancheng to care so much about Penny.

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,560
You really know how to play hard to get.

74
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,639
One day, I'll make sure you can't smile anymore.

75
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,759
What's going on with you?

76
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,239
Penny! I've been tricked!

77
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,899
 Hey, Hanqing. What's up?  
 - What do you think I'm doing?

78
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,659
 Working, of course. Unlike you, my brother. 

79
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,840
 Living the life of financial freedom. Traveling everywhere. 

80
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,040
 Hey, don't say I never think about you. 

81
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,919
 A friend of mine is looking for a studio to sign a big deal. 

82
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,000
 I recommended you. 

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,360
 At noon, you two should meet and discuss it. 

84
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,399
 - All right, sounds good. Thanks, bro.  
 - No problem. 

85
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,920
 I'll text you the time and location. 

86
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,639
 Great. Thanks. 

87
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,879
 Seems like luck is on my side and nothing can stop it now. 

88
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,040
 Miss Xiao, so you're the one who's looking to collaborate with our studio. 

89
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,279
 I've heard a lot about you. 

90
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,320
 - A pleasure to meet you. 
 - Director Liang, please have a seat. 

91
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,979
 You sit, too. 

92
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,519
 Miss Xiao, a toast to you. 

93
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,720
 Thank you for considering our studio. 

94
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,900
 Cheers! 

95
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,160
 Director Liang, you're too kind. 

96
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,040
 Actually, I've always admired your talents. 

97
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,639
  And I believe that with the right opportunity, you'll shine. 

98
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,120
 Miss Xiao, your words really touch my heart. 

99
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,760
 If you give us this chance, 

100
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,639
 I promise we won't let you down. 

101
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,839
 Words don't have the same persuasive power as a physical signed contract. 

102
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,979
 Here's the contract I've drafted. 

103
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,039
 Miss Xiao, just look at you. 

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,580
 Miss Xiao, I've drunk quite a bit. 

105
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,480
 Let me send this to Penny to review first. 

106
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,120
 Director Liang, there are countless studios vying to work with me. 

107
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,560
 Reaching out to you already shows my sincerity. 

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,960
 If you think it's unnecessary, then let's not waste time. 

109
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,240
 Miss Xiao! Wait, Miss Xiao, don't go! 

110
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,659
 Miss Xiao! Miss Xiao! 

111
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:25,960
 I trust you. 

112
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,179
 All right, let's sign the contract. 

113
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,020
 Let's sign it now. 

114
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,159
That's how it happened.

115
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,020
The terms in the contract were very tempting.

116
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,960
It seemed like a win-win,

117
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,840
so I signed it on the spot.

118
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,279
Who would have thought there would be such a big trap?

119
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,960
Before the project even begins, we'll owe them a fortune.

120
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,879
When I confronted her, her security guards beat me up.

121
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,120
You know, what did I ever do to Xiao Chuqing?

122
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,240
Why would she target a small studio like ours?

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,719
Xiao Chuqing is targeting me.

124
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,639
She knows I'm wary of her, so she's going after you instead.

125
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,440
Why you?

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,159
For what?

127
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,639
Because of Fu Yancheng.

128
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,120
This is really like gods fighting, and the common people suffer.

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,039
Since this happened because of me,

130
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,939
I feel responsible for helping the studio get through this crisis.

131
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:30,180
You have an idea?

132
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,640
Penny.

133
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,919
Maybe you can ask President Fu to help.

134
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,280
Since he's on great terms with Xiao Chuqing,

135
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,160
and Fu Group has top-notch legal teams,

136
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,520
they should easily be able to handle this legal dispute.

137
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,759
I understand your relationship with President Fu.

138
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,539
But...

139
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,539
Hello?

140
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,120
What?

141
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:06,200
What's going on?

142
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,639
One of our project partners suddenly wants to cancel the contract.

143
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,320
It's not just one anymore.

144
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,139
Seems like Xiao Chuqing has already spread the news.

145
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,279
President Fu.

146
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,320
President Fu, Miss Xiao Chuqing has suddenly taken action against Miss Penny's studio. It's probably because of you.

147
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,960
You're so close to her. Now, you're rushing to Penny's place.

148
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm not sure how Xiao Chuqing will react when she finds out.

149
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Why are you talking so much?

150
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,440
- I don't want to hear it. 
 - Su Su, listen to me.

151
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
This is all your fault.

152
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,700
You signed the contract without checking it properly.

153
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Now, look at this!

154
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,459
If we lose the lawsuit, the debts will take you a lifetime to repay.

155
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,639
- Su Su! 
 - Don't touch me.

156
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,759
Su Su, trust me.

157
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,879
I'll fix this. Okay?

158
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,059
Stop being angry.

159
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,039
- I don't want to talk to you. 
 - Let's go and have some Western cuisine.

160
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,440
- Qi Chen. 
 - President Fu.

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,120
Keep an eye on Liang Hanqing and that woman.

162
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,039
I want to know where they go later.

163
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,440
Yes, sir.

164
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:26,140

 "The Page You Appeared On"  - Joynam 

166
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:39,340
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

167
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:46,740
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

168
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:54,430
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

169
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,000
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,640
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

171
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:16,340
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

172
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,180
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

173
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,890
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

174
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,740
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

175
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,540
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

176
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,430
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

177
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,150
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

178
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:48,320
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
