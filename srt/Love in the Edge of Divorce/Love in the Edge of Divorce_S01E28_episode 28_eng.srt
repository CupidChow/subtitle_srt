1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:16,010


2
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,770
   

3
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,280
   

4
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,330
You'd better not pay for your own dreams at the expense of the shareholders.

5
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,780
The one-month probation isn't over yet.

6
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,960
Sheng Group is still led by Sheng Mian.

7
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,860
As far as I'm concerned, Sheng Mian's probation can be ended early.

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,210
 Let's see who dares to say that? 

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,960
I was the one who bought the patent from Michel Company.

10
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,860
And I will also transfer it, without conditions, to Sheng Group.

11
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,940
Sheng Mian, just do what you want to do.

12
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,120
I'll support you.

13
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,710
Why didn't you tell me last night that you bought the patent from Michel Company?

14
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,610
Because you weren't honest with me last night.

15
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,610
Honest about what?

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,430
I asked you if you missed me while I was gone.

17
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,460
No.

18
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,940
You really didn't?

19
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,140
Then it must be a yes.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,330
You flew around the world just to buy the patent, didn't you?

21
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,610
You care about me so much?

22
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,300
You even know my schedule.

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,590
Who's concerned about you?

24
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,980
Grandfather told me.

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,770
But it did wear me out.

26
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,750
After Michel Company's old boss passed away, the patent was passed on to his second son.

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,020
His second son is a famous playboy.

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,520
I chased him from New York to London. I even fed the pigeons with him.

29
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,310
And I had to go riding and racing with him.

30
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,190
Not to mention parachuting and clubbing.

31
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,830
I'm really tired from this trip.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And injured my hand when I was riding with him.

33
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,210
Is it serious?

34
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,020
That depends on how you handle it.

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,000
If you give me a kiss, then it won't hurt.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,680
If you spend the night with me, then the injury will be fully healed.

37
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,420
You've been getting hurt a lot lately.

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,210
I think you're just frail.

39
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,260
You'd better rest.

40
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,820
You dare to call me frail!

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,460
I'll prove it to you right now.

42
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,320
 You brat. 

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,930
 You just left without saying a word. 

44
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,260
 I think you don't care about your grandfather anymore. 

45
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,600
I wonder if you will do me the honor of visiting Grandfather after work tonight.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,810
Okay.

47
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,540
Grandfather, Mian Mian and I have come to see you.

48
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,830
Why are you laughing so happily?

49
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,080
You're just in time.

50
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,400
Have a seat.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
It's Wen Zhao.

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,980
He was telling me stories about Mian Mian's college days.

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,660
He said they had their first date at an escape room.

54
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,030
But Mian Mian accidentally caught her foot on the railing.

55
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,400
So, he walked all over a bunch of ghosts to save the lady.

56
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,970
I don't even remember that, Grandfather.

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,310
Anything else? I also want to hear about my wife's past.

58
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,330
Of course, and there are tons of them.

59
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,810
After all, youth is a long period of time.

60
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,610
Those were moments that were just for us.

61
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,980
No one can replace them.

62
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,810
Isn't that right, Sheng Mian?

63
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,630
Sheng Mian, some of our classmates want to get together tonight.

64
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,410
Do you want to come?

65
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,000
My wife isn't going anywhere tonight.

66
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,120
She isn't an accessory for you.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,850
You have no right to restrict her freedom.

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,090
I'm here to stay with Grandfather today.

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,000
I won't go.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,820
Grandfather, they're too noisy.

71
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,900
I'll take you for a walk around the garden.

72
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay. Let's go.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,410
- Come on. 
 - Let's go.

74
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,120
My wife isn't going anywhere tonight.

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,750
Grandfather,

76
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,410
actually, I've been meaning to ask you this.

77
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,600
When you came to our house to discuss the marriage,

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,410
Auntie Su highly recommended Sheng Weiyuan.

79
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,310
Why did you insist on choosing me?

80
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,720
There is a need for fate between people.

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,390
The moment you risked your life to save me,

82
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,060
your ties with the Fu family were forged.

83
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,730
It could only be you. No one else can replace you.

84
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,430
That was really just a small matter.

85
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,510
I have a knack for valuing some things for more than they seem to be worth.

86
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,260
Haven't you noticed?

87
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,820
You're the reason Yancheng smiles more.

88
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,270
He's more human, too.

89
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,210
Grandfather, you clearly know that Wen Zhao was Sheng Mian's first love.

90
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,530
Why did you ask him over?

91
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,900
Who is your grandson?

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,200
Are you afraid of Wen Zhao?

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,850
Is your relationship with her that fragile?

94
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,940
Not at all.

95
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,200
She only cares about me now anyway.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,940
What will my future great-grandson look like?

97
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,330
I'll try hard tonight, Grandfather.

98
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,800
Okay.

99
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,360
You're quite something.

100
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,850
 Brother Zhao, everyone came to the party in your honor. 

101
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,170
 We've waited for so long, but you haven't even showed up. 

102
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,750
 Everybody's pretty busy, so they left. 

103
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,030
 You surely understand that we can't go back to the past. 

104
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,260
Who did you think it was?

105
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,050
Sheng Mian?

106
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,580
During the day, Fu Yancheng looked so impressive.

107
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,090
At this moment, she should be lying in Fu Yancheng's arms

108
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,540
and enjoying a good night of rest.

109
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,580
Did you come all the way back from abroad just to hide here and drink?

110
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,120
You don't need to worry about my business.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,890
Just leave.

112
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,990
Did you know? I knew from the moment I saw you in the office

113
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,970
that we were the same type of people.

114
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,380
We are people who can't let go of the past and struggle within our memories.

115
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,550
What if I say that I know how to bring you and Sheng Mian back together?

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,290
Would you like to...

117
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,470
cooperate with me?

118
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,190
Is this the result of half a day's practice?

119
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,260
This mangled flower is exactly who I am.

120
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,900
Just like Eve was Adam's rib.

121
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,260
The part of me that's missing can be found in you.

122
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,290
How else could we be made for each other?

123
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,170
How did you get so glib?

124
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,730
Is it that disgusting?

125
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,360
I took the time to learn it from some foreigners.

126
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,650
You're learning very well.

127
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,330
But I don't want to drink coffee.

128
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,820
I'd like a glass of refreshing sparkling water.

129
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,560
Coming right up.

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
Sheng Mian, there's a new batch of fabric.

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,570
Come check it out with me.

132
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,080
Okay.

133
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,120
Aren't you leaving?

134
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,970
Go ahead. I'll be here when you get back.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,980
Do you need something?

136
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,070
I'm here for some documents.

137
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,830
So hot. So hot.

138
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,140
Soon you won't feel so hot.

139
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,880
When the news of your adultery is released, Sheng Group will be mine.

140
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:37,150


141
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,140
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

142
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:50,910
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

143
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:58,310
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

144
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:05,860
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

145
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,550
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

146
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:20,140
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

147
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:27,830
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

148
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,640
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

149
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,410
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

150
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,230
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

151
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,850
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

152
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,770
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

153
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,650
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

154
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:59,110
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
