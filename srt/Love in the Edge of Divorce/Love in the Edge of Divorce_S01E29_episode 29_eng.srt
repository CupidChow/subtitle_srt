00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,820
   

3
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,358
   

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,500
I had a sudden headache yesterday.

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,320
I really don't remember what happened.

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,290
Sheng Mian, about Yancheng and I...

7
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,020
If word of this gets out, the company will be greatly affected.

8
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,910
It seems like I'm the only one who could smooth this over as the new president.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,150
I don't think that will be necessary.

10
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,100
 In a little while, send Sheng Mian away while I drug Fu Yancheng. 

11
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,860
 You can take photos of us kissing as soon as he's under the drug's influence. 

12
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,400
What do you mean by this, Wen Zhao?

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,050
Isn't my meaning obvious?

14
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,330
Oh, by the way, I don't just have pictures of you two.

15
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,430
I also recorded you drugging Fu Yancheng.

16
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,710
It appears that there's always someone out there trying to ruin our marriage.

17
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,880
Unfortunately, they can't get what they want.

18
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,250
I've transferred all assets under my name to Sheng Mian unconditionally.

19
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,590
No matter what our future marital status is,

20
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,820
she will have the power to protect the Sheng Group.

21
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,080
Once I've decided, I never let go.

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,430
As for a particular someone, they won't get anything out of me.

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,840
Fu Yancheng, you're crazy.

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,590
I can even give you my life.

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,430
Not to mention all these material things.

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,290
I'll go to the press tomorrow and publish this.

27
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,180
You coward.

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,930
You deserve to be pushed around.

29
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,630
You'll never get another chance in this life.

30
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,030
Thank you.

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,580
From now on, Sheng Weiyuan will be suspended from all work.

32
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,670
You should think carefully about your future.

33
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,520
You're something else.

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,020
Your acting skills are as good as mine.

35
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,320
I'm so much better than you.

36
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,900
Am I a worse actor than him?

37
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,740
 Sheng Weiyuan wants to cooperate with me 

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,660
 to make fake news about adultery. 

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,420
 The condition is that I must help her get Sheng Group. 

40
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,860
 And she will help me get Sheng Mian. 

41
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,360
 Then, why are you telling me this? 

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,580
 Don't you want to get back with Sheng Mian? 

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,560
 Yes, I do like her. 

44
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,260
 But I want to do it in a decent way. 

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,020
 Of course, we need to make the most of Sheng Weiyuan. 

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,420
 We can work with each other. 

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,560
 We can pretend we know nothing at all. 

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,760
 Sure, let's work together. 

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,630
 Wen Zhao, 

50
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,730
 if we weren't both in love with Sheng Mian right now, we would be good friends. 

51
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,850
 Don't overthink it. 

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,260
Wen Zhao, I have a few more ideas about the next quarter.

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,840
Stop by my office today after the meeting.

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,980
President Fu, this is a client profile for Sheng Group.

55
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,120
Let's have a talk.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,930
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

57
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,030
Sheng Mian, watch out!

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,270
Fu Yancheng!

59
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,120
- President Fu. 
 - Fu Yancheng!

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,890
- Fu Yancheng! 
 - President Fu, how do you feel?

61
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,390
To the hospital!

62
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,140
Ms. Sheng, stay here. I'll bring the car.

63
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,950
Fu Yancheng! Fu Yancheng, wake up! Don't scare me.

64
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,560
Fu Yancheng!

65
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,390
 Sheng Mian? 

66
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,310
 What's wrong, Sheng Mian? 

67
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,630
 Sheng Mian! 

68
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,610
 What happened to you, Sheng Mian? 

69
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,600
Fu Yancheng!

70
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,480
Fu Yancheng, please hang on!

71
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,630
- Presdient Fu. 
 - We're almost there.

72
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,800
Fu Yancheng, we're almost there.

73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,050
President Fu, hang on.

74
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,880
Hurry, hurry!

75
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,630
Don't worry.

76
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,310
You're awake. How do you feel now?

77
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,620
I'm okay.

78
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,500
Except for feeling dizzy, limb weakness, muscle aches, and hazy consciousness,

79
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,190
I'm okay.

80
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,580
It's okay.

81
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,610
The doctor says I won't die so soon.

82
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,800
And I hurt my arm, too.

83
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,480
It really hurts.

84
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,530
I need someone to take care of me.

85
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,950
I'm calling Qi Chen now.

86
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,120
No.

87
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,060
He's on paternity leave.

88
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,900
His wife had a baby.

89
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,190
Then I'll call Grandfather.

90
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,000
It's not a good idea for Grandfather either.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,270
He's too old to take care of me.

92
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,070
He'll be worried about me again.

93
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,800
- Then I can... 
 - Then I'll take care of President Fu.

94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,560
I also have some business matters that I want to consult President Fu about.

95
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,770
No. I can't deal with work now.

96
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,670
I feel dizzy and weak. My arm hurts, and I can't even sign documents.

97
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,730
How could I possibly handle such a big project?

98
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,540
Then come home with me.

99
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,820
You're so good to me.

100
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,340
It's all because of me.

101
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,750
You got hurt because of me.

102
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,830
I should take care of you.

103
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,470
Eat something.

104
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,550
- What's wrong? 
 - You...

105
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,150
You're pressing me in that area.

106
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,680
I can get hurt somewhere else.

107
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,310
But nothing can happen to that.

108
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,380
It concerns our future and Grandfather's dream.

109
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,140
Fu Yancheng!

110
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,390
And you said you were fine.

111
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,400
Only your mouth refuses to calm down.

112
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,600
That's not the case.

113
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,480
Let's hurry and eat.

114
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,240
Feed me.

115
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,580
All right. I'll feed you.

116
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,600
I don't want to eat this.

117
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,640
Then, what do you want to eat?

118
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,490
You know what I want.

119
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,600
I don't think you're hungry. Don't eat.

120
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,850
Give it to me, please.

121
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,270
All right. I'd better help you.

122
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,510
I guess it was a blessing in disguise.

123
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,870
Shut up.

124
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,330
Can't you be quiet even while you're eating?

125
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,220
Sheng Mian.

126
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,630
Sheng Mian! Come help me. Quickly.

127
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,610
I can't manage. Hurry and come here.

128
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
What's wrong?

129
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,140
I need to go to the bathroom.

130
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,390
Then, go.

131
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,910
I'm really dizzy right now.

132
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,750
- I can't stand by myself. 
 - Then why not just sit down?

133
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,630
You fed me too much.

134
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,080
My stomach is so bloated right now.

135
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,840
Please help me.

136
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,040
My head is spinning, and my hands are weak.

137
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,200
It's not like you haven't seen it before.

138
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,020
- Fu Yancheng... 
 - I'm going to the bathroom.

139
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,240
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

140
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,260
No peeking.

141
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,040
Who wants to peek at you?

142
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,220
Sheng Mian, please sleep in the bedroom with me tonight.

143
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,650
I'm afraid I'll need you in the middle of the night...

144
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,870
to walk me to the bathroom.

145
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,100
You are injured and need to rest.

146
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,600
You can sleep in the bedroom at night. I'll sleep on the couch.

147
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,250
Let me know if you need anything, okay?

148
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,100
I can sleep better if you're with me.

149
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,290
This will help me heal.

150
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,500
Knock it off.

151
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,530
Right now, you should rest.

152
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,840
If I find out you're sneaking around in the middle of the night,

153
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,060
I'll leave tomorrow.

154
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,500
Go to sleep.

155
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,470
Come on. Go to bed.

156
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:33,930

You ran back here on your own last night. Did you forget?

I must have been half awake...

I forgot you were here.

165
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,900
You groped me all night. Have you forgotten?

166
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,570
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

167
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,380
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

168
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,250
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

169
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,030
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

170
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:53,300
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫

171
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,070
I'm going to work.

172
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:12,960
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

173
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,300
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

174
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:27,110
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

175
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,080
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

176
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:38,820
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

177
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:46,170
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

178
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:53,800
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

179
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,470
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

180
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:08,090
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

181
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:15,750
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

182
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,580
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

183
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,310
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

184
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,090
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

185
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,780
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

186
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,780
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

187
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,560
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

188
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:47,090
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
