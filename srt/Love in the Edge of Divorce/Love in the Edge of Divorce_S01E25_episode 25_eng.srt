00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,740
   

3
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,385
   

4
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,000
Yan Cheng.

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,879
Sheng Mian.

6
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,000
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,100
Yancheng, can we start over?

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,519
We'll have children again.

9
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,659
Sheng Weiyuan, what are you doing here?

10
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,319
Yancheng. Yancheng.

11
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,900
I've liked you for so long.

12
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,159
I'm also a daughter of the Sheng family.

13
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,899
I can do everything that Sheng Mian can do.

14
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,920
What's the matter?

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,619
I'm not divorced yet.

16
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:47,940
So eager to get into your brother-in-law's bed?

17
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,059
Sheng Mian.

18
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,619
Let me explain. I didn't know it was her.

19
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,000
You don't need to explain.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
I already know.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,819
Sheng Mian, you did that on purpose.

22
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,460
Honey. Let's start over, okay?

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,620
Sure.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,919
It's just a man.

25
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,779
Tomorrow, I'll take over as the president of Sheng Group.

26
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,379
What kind of man can't I get?

27
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,139
You're really impressive, Sister.

28
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,259
I'll soon be calling you President Sheng.

29
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,140
Well then, I wish you all the best tomorrow, Sister.

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,139
Sheng Mian.

31
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,439
I know you were lying about starting over, but I don't care.

32
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,680
I can wait until you truly forgive me.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,559
You're drunk. Go to sleep.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,499
Goodbye.

35
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,020
 Sheng Mian, I will win you back. 

36
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,679
Shareholders, we are deeply saddened by President Sheng's passing.

37
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,760
But the company cannot be without leadership.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,059
The document you have in hand

39
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:28,659
is the agreement where Sheng Zhong transferred all his shares to Sheng Weiyuan.

40
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,460
So, if there are no objections,

41
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,580
Sheng Weiyuan will take over as president.

42
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,219
Please trust me.

43
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:39,520
As Sheng Zhong's daughter, I will fulfill my father's last wish

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,900
and contribute to Sheng Group's development.

45
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,839
Wait a minute.

46
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,939
My dear sister. This is such an important meeting.

47
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,560
How could you forget to invite me?

48
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,560
Sheng Mian, that's not your seat!

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,860
Don't forget, your dad left no shares to you.

50
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,300
And you don't have any position in the company.

51
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,960
Don't interfere with our meeting.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,379
Let me correct you.

53
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,080
I'm not interfering.

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,719
I'm not like those who take crooked paths.

55
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,979
I walked in here openly, through the front door of the company.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,659
Besides, I have some files here.

57
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:26,940
Evidence of Auntie Su and Lawyer Wang tampering with my father's will.

58
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,759
Please take a look.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,900
Sheng Mian, these are just baseless documents.

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,360
You can't prove the nonsense you're spouting.

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,900
You're too desperate to become the president.

62
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,620
Don't trust her!

63
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,700
Auntie Su, what a coincidence.

64
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,519
Not long ago, I ran into Lawyer Wang.

65
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,900
And he wanted me to tell you this.

66
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,200
He's been unable to sleep, thinking of you.

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,859
Sheng Mian, don't talk nonsense!

68
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:53,340
Lawyer Wang and I are completely innocent!

69
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,439
Everyone, don't-don't believe what she says

70
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,079
Innocent?

71
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,399
Ladies and gentlemen.

72
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,940
This is the recording of what happened in the hospital when my father was seriously ill.

73
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,859
Mrs. Su Lan and Lawyer Wang are caught on it.

74
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:14,299
As for whether they're innocent, you can judge for yourselves.

75
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,640
 He just fell into a coma. 

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,439
 That old devil actually left all his property to that little wretch, Sheng Mian. 

77
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,720
 We need to make our plans earlier. 

78
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,779
 Don't worry. I'm here. 

79
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,339
 After Sheng Zhong dies, we won't have to keep our affair a secret anymore. 

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,279
Shareholders,

81
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,179
this notarized document is the real asset transfer agreement signed by President Zhong before his death.

82
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,339
I'm the biggest shareholder of Sheng Group.

83
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:56,460
From now on, I'll take over the Sheng Group from my father.

84
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,000
Mom! How could you do that with Lawyer Wang?

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,379
Did you ever care about Dad?

86
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,979
Daughter, it's all my fault.

87
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,399
Shareholders, Sheng Weiyuan has been completely unaware of this matter from the beginning.

88
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,739
She's put a lot of effort into managing Sheng Group.

89
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:25,700
I hope you won't look down on her because of me.

90
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,739
So what if you're the biggest shareholder?

91
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,940
You've never worked a day at Sheng Group.

92
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,539
You aren't familiar with the company's affairs.

93
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,099
Can everyone here trust you with the company?

94
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:37,619
 Who says she's unfamiliar? 

95
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,219
Shareholders, I'm an investor of Sheng Group.

96
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,879
I'm also president of Fu Group, Fu Yancheng.

97
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,820
Although Sheng Mian has never worked here,

98
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,260
she personally completed both of your financing documents.

99
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,959
Moreover, she has made a very precise analysis of the future development of the Sheng Group.

100
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,419
If it weren't for Su Lan's embezzlement of public funds, Sheng Group wouldn't be in this plight.

101
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,760
I believe all of you are intelligent folks,

102
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,419
which is why you are shareholders.

103
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,079
If all you do is blindly follow others

104
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,020
and are unwilling to trust Sheng Mian,

105
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,920
I suggest you simply withdraw.

106
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,580
I'll immediately buy out any shareholder who wishes to leave.

107
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,460
According to company regulations, the president has a one-month probation period.

108
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,519
If the company's performance   does not increase by at least 20 percent over this time period,

109
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,600
the president must step down.

110
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,460
No problem.

111
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,839
You have no chance of winning against me.

112
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,359
If I fail during the month of probation, I'll take the blame and resign.

113
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,120
Anyway, thank you for helping me today.

114
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,579
Then can you give me a chance to treat you to dinner tonight?

115
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,179
I've got so many things to tell you.

116
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,020
There's a psychology clinic right next door.

117
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,659
You can say whatever you want there.

118
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,879
I've just taken over Sheng Group.

119
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,559
I'm busy.

120
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,639
President Sheng, these are the resumes of the professional manager applicants.

121
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,159
Thank you.

122
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,120
Are you looking for a professional manager?

123
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,600
Do you need help?

124
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,180
No.

125
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,219
President Sheng, I'm here for an interview.

126
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,100
Wen Zhao.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,159
What are you doing here?

128
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,779
Sheng Mian, long time no see.

129
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,200
Long time no see.

130
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
It's been so many years, but you're still the same as before.

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,060
You haven't changed a single bit.

132
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,299
Who is this?

133
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:33,059
This is President Fu Yancheng of Fu Group.

134
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,540
I'm also Sheng Mian's husband.

135
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,960
Hello, President Fu. I'm Sheng Mian's college classmate.

136
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,179
I'm also her first love.

137
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,320
 I called you here because I need you for something. 

138
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,860
 What's that? 

139
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,419
 Sheng Mian is about to take over Sheng Group. 

140
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,240
 She needs an experienced professional manager. 

141
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,260
 You've been managing Fu Group's overseas business. 

142
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,539
 I'm well aware of your capabilities. 

143
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,859
 So, I wanted you to come back and help Sheng Mian. 

144
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,279
 President Fu, you know my relationship with Sheng Mian. 

145
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,819
 In addition, I've always had feelings for her. 

146
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:25,459
 Aren't you afraid that... 

147
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:30,380
 Sheng Mian is about to divorce Fu Yancheng. 

148
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,939
 But I trust my judgment. 

149
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:35,819
 These kids are destined to be together. 

150
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:38,120
 They will never be separated. 

151
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,519
 As for how you handle things with Mian Mian, 

152
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,360
 that's a matter for you young people. 

153
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,379
 I won't interfere. 

154
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,960
 I understand what you're saying. 

155
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,900
 Do I still need to attend the company meeting this afternoon? 

156
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,960
 After all these years, I've never even met the young President Fu. 

157
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,440
 You don't need to attend. 

158
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
 You're going to help Mian Mian. 

159
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,240
 You'll have enough chances to meet him. 

160
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,959
 That makes sense. 

161
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,299
So, how are you adjusting to life at Sheng Group?

162
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,079
It's going well.

163
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,919
Thank you, Wen Zhao.

164
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,260
I know you've been working abroad for companies worth billions.

165
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,500
You're lowering your salary to help me.

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
I'll remember your kindness.

167
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,559
Once the company gets back on track, I'll compensate you for your salary.

168
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,139
Sheng Mian, I'm helping you not for the money.

169
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,179
If I hadn't insisted on going abroad back then, we wouldn't have broken up.

170
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,000
Actually, for all these years, I've been missing you while I was abroad.

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
I know.

172
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,359
You're about to get a divorce.

173
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
Sheng Mian, I don't want to lose you again.

174
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,959
Let go of her!

175
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:09,040

 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

177
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:23,000
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,310
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

179
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:37,920
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

180
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,610
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

181
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:52,260
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

182
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,930
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

183
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,670
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

184
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,460
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

185
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,340
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

186
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,940
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

187
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,960
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

188
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,760
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

189
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:31,190
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
