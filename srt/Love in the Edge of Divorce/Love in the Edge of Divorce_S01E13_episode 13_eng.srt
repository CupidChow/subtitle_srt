2
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,730
   

3
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,318
   

4
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,519
So, that's how it is.

5
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,559
We really have no other options.

6
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
I know your company has the best legal advisors.

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,050
Could you lend us a hand?

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,920
The problem was caused by your husband.

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,680
And now you're the one begging for help?

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,359
Why isn't he handling this himself?

11
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,080
Something urgent came up for him and he left.

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,259
I can coordinate all the details myself.

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,300
You are certainly devoted to him.

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
My husband only wanted the best for me and the company.

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,359
He was just momentarily confused and tricked by Miss Xiao.

16
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:33,040
I can help you, but I have one condition.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,079
What condition?

18
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,899
For the good of the company, I'll do anything.

19
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:37,599
Go on a date with me.

20
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,500
A date?

21
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,479
President Fu, can you give me a reason for that?

22
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,240
To cause you to verify whether your dedication is worth it or not.

23
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,959
 President Fu, Liang Hanqing just arrived at The Monologue Café. 

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
Have you made up your mind?

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,639
All right. A date, then.

26
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,180
Let's go.

27
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,020
Right now?

28
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,320
Sir, your reserved table is over here.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,259
Director Liang? What a coincidence.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,799
I invited your wife here to discuss some matters.

31
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,400
I hope we aren't interrupting your date.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,180
Wife?

33
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,160
Liang Hanqing!

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
You hid your marriage with Penny from me?

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,080
Yes, we're secretly married.

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,360
Su Su, I'll explain later.

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,679
Liang Hanqing, why didn't you tell Su Su about us?

38
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,479
You shouldn't keep secrets from Su Su.

39
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,599
Liang, I expect a thorough explanation.

40
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,479
That's all for today. I'm leaving now.

41
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,379
- Miss Su. 
 - What?

42
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,619
Why wait for an explanation?

43
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:04,420
You can hear it now.

44
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,360
President Fu, don't you think you're meddling too much?

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,300
I wouldn't bother with other things,

46
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,980
but when it comes to you, I must intervene.

47
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,700
Hurting two women at the same time. That's not what a man should do.

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,939
Make a choice now.

49
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,359
Your wife or your mistress.

50
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,360
 The company still needs Penny to persuade President Fu. 

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,239
 Su Su, whatever you do to me tonight, I'll accept. 

52
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,439
I choose...

53
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,040
my wife.

54
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,280
Su Su, listen to me.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,219
It's not what you think.

56
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,820
President Fu, this is a private family matter.

57
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,360
You're crossing the line.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,759
I just don't want you to keep being deceived.

59
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,520
Thank you for your concern.

60
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,560
But no matter what Hanqing does, I won't divorce him.

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,000
- Why not? 
 - Because I love him.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,479
You just saw it.

63
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,840
He won't leave me, either.

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,960
Our relationship isn't that fragile.

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,680
- Is that so? 
 - Of course.

66
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,240
And since I've already gone on a date with you, I hope you'll keep your word.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,600
Who said it'd be just one date?

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,099
- You… 
 - Come with me for another one.

69
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,419
Take it as making it up to me.

70
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,839
Let's go.

71
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,819
I'll take you somewhere.

72
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,100
 It's him... 

73
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,879
 Dad is so happy today. 

74
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,879
 Come! Let's toast my precious daughter, Sheng Mian, 

75
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,299
 for getting into her dream university. 

76
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,759
 Thank you, Dad. 

77
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,360
 And let's also toast to Wei Yuan's birthday. 

78
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,240
 Right! Today's also Wei Yuan's birthday. 

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
 Here, let's cut the cake together. 

80
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,179
 Come on. 

81
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,920
 Just because I'm not his first wife's daughter, 

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,480
 am I destined to never live up to my older sister? 

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,920
 Careful! 

84
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,139
 You aren't hurt, are you? 

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,579
 Be careful. 

86
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,739
 I never expected fate to bring us together again. 

87
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,480
President Fu, the business department called.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,959
They need you at the Fu Group headquarters for a meeting.

89
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,600
 President Fu? Fu Group headquarters? 

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,379
 Could he be Fu Yancheng? 

91
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,900
 Sheng Mian? 

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,540
 How is it they are together? 

93
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,759
 The one I've been longing for is actually Sheng Mian's husband. 

94
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,959
 My brother-in-law. 

95
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,899
 No, wait. 

96
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,800
 Fu Yancheng hates Sheng Mian so much. 

97
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,040
 How could he be so close to her? 

98
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,379
 There's definitely something fishy going on here. 

99
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,560
President Fu, you're back.

100
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,059
- When is the Fu Group gala happening? 
 - Three months from now.

101
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,439
Move it up to next week.

102
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,720
President Fu, isn't that too rushed?

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,919
Is there a problem?

104
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,539
If you don't want your position as special assistant anymore,

105
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,820
I don't mind finding someone else.

106
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,959
No problem.

107
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,199
Tonight, deliver a gown to Miss Penny.

108
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,620
Also, invite all the clients who terminated contracts with Miss Penny's studio.

109
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,539
Understood.

110
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,599
Miss Penny, as per President Fu's instructions, this is as far as I can take you.

111
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:06,700
Please enjoy this gala, prepared just for you.

112
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,079
Just for me?

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,519
 I'd like to see what's really going on between those two. 

114
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,530
♫  I can't forget you  ♫ 
 ♫  It's futile to worry about you  ♫

115
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,780
♫  You shake me when you appear  ♫

116
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,840
♫  I regard you as higher than the sky  ♫ 
  ♫  No one can replace you  ♫

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,860
♫  Is it a little ridiculous?  ♫

118
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,660
♫  The hug I once coveted  ♫

119
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,730
♫  I never had it for a second  ♫

120
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:02,590
♫  I actually still enjoy the unbearable torment  ♫

121
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,090
♫  It is a storm of memories  ♫ 
 ♫  I am still obsessed with it  ♫

122
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,830
♫  The ticket to enter your world was torn off by your own hands  ♫

123
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:19,260
♫  My hobby is to have you and be able to rely on you  ♫

124
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,099
This dress looks stunning on you.

125
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,680
Thank you.

126
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,010
♫  I don't know. I don't want to know. No need to know  ♫

127
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:34,390
♫  But my love has never receded because of this  ♫

128
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,219
Ladies and gentlemen.

129
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,059
Allow me to introduce this talented new designer, Miss Penny.

130
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,779
She's incredibly gifted.

131
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,279
The interior design of Royal View Garden was her work.

132
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,879
Oh, so that was her project?

133
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,399
We happen to have a new design project.

134
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,200
Miss Penny, would you be interested?

135
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,399
Of course, I'd love to hear more.

136
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,519
Great. Let's arrange a meeting.

137
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,500
All right.

138
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,440
 Isn't that the designer I just terminated? 

139
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,260
 How is she so close to Fu Yancheng? 

140
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,559
President Zhou!

141
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,039
Didn't your company just terminate a designer recently?

142
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,240
Would you like to discuss a collaboration with our Miss Penny?

143
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,039
President Fu, you must be mistaken.

144
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:27,120
The termination was likely caused by a misunderstanding within our company.

145
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,840
The previous designer was excellent, just like Miss Penny.

146
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,639
We'll continue to work with them.

147
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,600
Miss Penny.

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,099
It seems like you'll have to wait for another opportunity to work with President Zhou.

149
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,399
Thank you, President Zhou.

150
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,440
Until next time.

151
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,859
Yes, until next time.

152
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,960
Thank you for your dedication to the studio, President Fu.

153
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,720
I'm not doing this for them.

154
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,599
I'm doing it for you.

155
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,519
 Why are they here? 

156
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,839
 I can't let Fu Yancheng's mother see me. 

157
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,279
 Ladies and gentlemen, the Fu Group Charity Gala is officially starting. 

158
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,299
Who is that woman dancing with Yancheng?

159
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:07,200
An entire gala moved up by three months for one woman?

160
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,919
I need to see who has captured his attention.

161
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,860
 Just from the back, I can tell it's that wretch, Penny, again. 

162
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,179
Auntie, let's go see and we'll find out.

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,639
Where did that woman who was dancing with President Fu go?

164
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,240
They went toward the restroom.

 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

167
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:16,070
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

168
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:23,480
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

169
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:31,040
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

170
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,710
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

171
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:45,370
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

172
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:53,000
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

173
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,830
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

174
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,640
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

175
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,430
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

176
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,190
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

177
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,090
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

178
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,870
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

179
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:24,330
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
