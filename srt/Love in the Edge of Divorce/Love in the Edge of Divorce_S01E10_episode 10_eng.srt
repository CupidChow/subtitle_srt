1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:15,960


2
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,630
   

3
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,451
   

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,560
 I want to see who this woman really is. 

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 President Fu, there's a problem. 

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,300
 The project that was previously outsourced to the Sheng family has been aborted, resulting in heavy losses. 

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,499
What are you saying?

8
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:16,159
 The bricks supplied by the Sheng family were all of poor quality, 

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,719
 posing significant safety hazards. 

10
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,820
 Now, they are suing us for compensation. 

11
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,519
The Sheng family, particularly Sheng Zhong, is overestimating their abilities.

12
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,799
They have repeatedly demanded the Fu family to inject capital into their venture.

13
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,879
Meanwhile, Sheng Mian is deliberately delaying the divorce.

14
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,319
They are all parasites.

15
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,519
It appears I was too kind to them before.

16
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,159
From today on, Fu Group will withdraw all investments in the Sheng Group.

17
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,080
 Yes, President Fu. 

18
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,100
   

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,519
 Repulsive! 

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,959
 Listen, Sheng Mian. 

21
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,599
 Stop taking advantage in the name of the Fu family. 

22
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,480
 I, Fu Yancheng, will never accept a woman from the Sheng family. 

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,040
 If you still don't proceed with the divorce, 

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,279
 I will thoroughly destroy the Sheng family's business. 

25
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,219
 Fine. I agree to the divorce. 

26
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,919
Sheng Mian, I'm so disappointed in you.

27
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,479
Never mind that your ex-boyfriend from college, Wen Zhao, couldn't help the Sheng family.

28
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,719
Now, you've finally been blessed by marrying Fu Yancheng.

29
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,119
But you don't even know how to cherish it.

30
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,459
You even offended him.

31
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,479
Well, now you've offended Fu Yancheng.

32
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,479
Why would the Fu family possibly help us get through this difficult time?

33
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,960
I don't need you to interfere in my romantic relationships.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,560
If you weren't greedy and short-sighted for money, would it have come to this?

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,759
Don't blame me for your own mistakes.

36
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,939
Listen up. I won't use my marriage for anything else.

37
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,759
And I don't want to have any more dealings with the Fu family.

38
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,480
I'll definitely proceed with the divorce.

39
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,100
The Sheng family will be ruined by you sooner or later.

40
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,620
Mian Mian, I know you're treated poorly.

41
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,879
But I don't at all agree with your divorce from Yancheng.

42
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,520
Grandfather, he despises me to the extreme.

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,419
What's the point of going on like this?

44
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:33,120
Yancheng is angry and speaks without restraint.

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
That's why he's so harsh.

46
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,699
Don't worry. I'll definitely teach him a lesson for you.

47
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,640
Mian Mian, are you so eager to get a divorce

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,239
because you still like your college boyfriend, Wen Zhao?

49
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,759
How could that be, Grandfather?

50
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,599
We've lost touch with each other for ages.

51
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,360
That's great. Mian Mian, listen to me.

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,820
In the future, don't mention divorce again.

53
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,479
 Penny, let's have dinner together tomorrow night. 

54
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,140
 I've reserved a table with a view at Feng Ya. 

55
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,279
President Fu, Penny isn't responding to messages or answering calls.

56
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,360
She's probably busy or her phone is malfunctioning.

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,439
Why don't you wait a little longer instead of coming to her studio to find her?

58
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,759
I must see her.

59
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,160
President Fu, you're here.

60
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,199
Where is Penny?

61
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,240
She isn't here now.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Then, I'll come back again tomorrow.

63
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,079
But she won't be here tomorrow either.

64
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,799
President Fu! President Fu! Penny really isn't here.

65
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,759
Why are you avoiding me?

66
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,199
I'm not.

67
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,979
Is that so?

68
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,859
Why don't you dare to look me in the eyes?

69
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,079
It's late. Go home, President Fu.

70
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,360
I won't leave until you explain yourself.

71
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,199
Penny, you must understand my feelings.

72
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,120
How could I possibly know what you're thinking?

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,179
You're sulking.

74
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,360
You're my client.

75
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,879
How could I sulk around you?

76
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,759
Can it be that you just want me to be a client?

77
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,040
It's midnight.

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,039
Happy birthday.

79
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,240
This your favorite, the Sunlight necklace.

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,444
I originally planned to give it to you at dinner tomorrow night.

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,199
It's too expensive. I can't accept it.

82
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,199
Fine, I'll toss it out.

83
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,760
No!

84
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,659

105
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,519
 Stop taking advantage in the name of the Fu family. 

106
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,480
 I, Fu Yancheng, will never accept a woman from the Sheng family. 

107
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,759
 If you still don't proceed with the divorce, 

108
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,900
 I will thoroughly destroy the Sheng family's business. 

109
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,200
I have a husband.

110
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,260
What did you say?

111
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,040
I said, I'm married.

112
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,200
I have a husband.

113
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,019
Who is your husband?

114
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,359
Tell me. Who is he?

115
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,500
I want to know.

116
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,980
Hello.

117
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,240
Hanqing.

118
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,760
How is your business trip going?

119
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,739
Then get some rest.

120
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,440
Don't worry.

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,719
I'll also go to bed early.

122
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,520
Your husband is Liang Hanqing?

123
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,400
Right.

124
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,679
Why didn't you tell me that?

125
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,960
- You clearly know I... 
 - President Fu.

126
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,480
I apologize if I have caused any misunderstanding.

127
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,899
In the future, I won't behave in a way that causes you trouble.

128
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll pretend nothing happened today.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,280
I hope you will do the same.

130
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,759
And there's this.  This gift is too expensive.

140
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,799
 both he and Bai Qiu despise me and the Sheng family immensely. 

141
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,279
 Even if Fu Yancheng knows that I am Sheng Mian, 

142
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,279
 our relationship in the future would be filled with hardships.

 Rather than being trapped in a complicated marital relationship,

 it's better to focus on my career and not get involved in romance again.

♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

159
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,380
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

160
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:22,940
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

161
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:30,640
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

162
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,420
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

163
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,260
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

164
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,060
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

165
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,650
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

166
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,700
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

167
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,510
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

168
00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:02,060
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
