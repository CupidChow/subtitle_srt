1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:09,720


2
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,640
   

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,880
   

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,750
Penny! What a rare guest!

5
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,640
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,420
President Xiao, please don't make fun of me,

7
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,390
I'm only a regular employee.

8
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm looking for President Fu today.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,350
Director Xiao, you know Penny, too?

10
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,120
Of course. She's very famous in our circle.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,000
Not only is she great at her job, she's very pretty.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,480
It's very hard to get a date with her.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,810
Penny, I see you came prepared.

14
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,790
Are you going to play a match with President Fu?

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,990
I wonder if President Fu will give me this chance?

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,590
I'm not interested.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,120
President Fu, you're such a cold-hearted guy.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
Of course, I'd like to play a match with Penny.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
President Fu, why not give me a chance?

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,630
How about this?

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,310
Let's make a deal.

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,890
If I win, you'll give me five minutes.

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,850
If I lose, I'll leave right away.

24
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,940
I said I'm not interested.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,200
Maybe you're worried you can't beat me?

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,220
You're afraid you'll lose to me?

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,510
You asked for this.

28
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,500
 Director Xiao, the studio where Penny works has mortgaged a high amount of loans. 

29
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,840
 It will come to auction if it isn't paid off within three months. 

30
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,080
So, she's anxious to get President Fu's deal to help with that.

31
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,080
What a great match. It's a tie.

32
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,750
I never thought that Penny could play so well.

33
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,760
- President Fu, I... 
 - Penny, just admit defeat and go.

34
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,720
But you didn't actually win, so I still have a chance.

35
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,020
Fine. If you won't go, I will.

36
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,110
President Fu!

37
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,310
Penny, don't be in such a hurry.

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,000
What do you need, Director Xiao?

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,160
Did anyone tell you that you're a pretty girl, but also very proud.

40
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,750
Every time I call your office, you try to brush me off.

41
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,800
So, I wondered what brought you over to my territory today.

42
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you short of money?

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,020
Director Xiao, if you have something to say, just be straightforward.

44
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,530
I know you mortgaged your studio.

45
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,850
But I've always admired your talent.

46
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,770
I'd like to help you.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,360
Come to my place at 7:00 p.m. tonight.

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,270
We can talk.

49
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,330
Penny, you're here. Come, take a seat.

50
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,490
Actually, President Fu is going to sign the contract with me tonight.

51
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,670
But as you know, I'm always a man who cares for ladies.

52
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,920
I know your studio is in trouble now.

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,240
As long as you drink everything here,

54
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,560
I'll help you out by giving you Fu Yancheng's order.

55
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,240
What do you say?

56
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,930
All right, I'll drink.

57
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,490
Penny.

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,270
I will give you Fu Yancheng's deal...

59
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,430
But only after I'm done having some fun with you.

60
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,200
What are you doing?

61
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,530
Let me go! Let go!

62
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,270
You can't get away tonight.

63
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,240
Help!

64
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm Fu Yancheng's wife. He's my husband.

65
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,420
If he finds out about this, the entire Xiao Group couldn't afford the consequences.

66
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,070
You're lying.

67
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,130
If he's really your husband, why were you putting on a show on the tennis court?

68
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,050
And you wouldn't come to me for that deal.

69
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,510
That's because we've been fighting these days.

70
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,320
This is our deal, a game between a married couple. Don't you understand.

71
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,990
I can call him right now.

72
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,240
You can ask him yourself.

73
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,480
You lied to me!

74
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480

I was going to take her home.

Darling, he's lying.

He's trying to do bad things to me.

I'm sure you know who's telling the truth, Director Xiao.

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,870
Could Penny really be his wife?

 But why did I just do that to her? 

117
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,600
President Fu, this is the number of the designer you asked me to look for.

118
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,790
 Did I hear wrong just now? 

119
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,180
 Why was there a woman's voice? 

120
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,320
Hello?

121
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,370
Hello, this is Fu Yancheng.

122
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,750
Fu Yancheng, why did you do this to me?

123
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,510
Talk to me! Why did you do this to me?

124
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,480
You won't talk to me every time I meet you.

125
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,390
I've tried so hard,

but all I'm asking for is just one chance.

Exactly what did I do wrong

129
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,340
that you keep rejecting me?

130
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,220
Speak up.

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,870
