 Episode 15] 

4
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,560
You're up pretty early.

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,480
How do you feel?

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,120
Thank you for your concern.

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,960
I have something I need to do; I'm leaving.

8
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,680
Why are you still calling me President Fu?

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,580
Last night...

10
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,760
Last night, thank you for helping me out.

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,490
And thank you for introducing so many clients to me.

12
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,320
So, you plan to kick me away now that you don't need me anymore?

13
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,100
That wasn't how you behaved last night.

14
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,460
Tell me. When do you plan to divorce your husband?

15
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,350
Divorce?

16
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,530
What, you plan to go back on your word?

17
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,389
I'm sorry, President Fu.

18
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,790
I really have to go now.

19
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,990
I'll do my best with the Royal View Garden project.

20
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,760
Penny.

21
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,860
Were you really drunk last night?

22
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,700
 So, Fu Yancheng doesn't know Penny is actually Sheng Mian. 

23
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,750
I'll give you a ride; I'll take you back.

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,660
- That's not necessary, President Fu. 
 - I need to talk to you.

25
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,030
President Fu, you said that you need to talk to me.

26
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,440
Do you plan to have another date with me?

27
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,170
What? Are you afraid?

28
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,120
Take a look at this.

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,810
I asked Qi Chen to bring back the contract you signed with Xiao Chuqing.

30
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,280
Thank you, President Fu. And I'm sorry for bothering you.

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,660
It's okay. It's what you're supposed to do for your wife.

32
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,150
President Fu, is here some misunderstanding between us?

33
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,030
Is there?

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,530
Then why did you call me your husband last night?

35
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,150
President Fu, I was drunk last night. That was all drunk talk.

36
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,510
Please don't take it seriously.

37
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,910
Qi Chen, be careful!

38
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,830
Fu Yancheng.

39
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,240
Fu Yancheng.

40
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,790
    
    

41
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,950
Doctor, where's the man who was just with me?

42
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,850
He's seriously injured, and he's still receiving treatment.

43
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,580
Sorry, we have tried our best.

44
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,340
Fu Yancheng.

45
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,850
Fu Yancheng.

46
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,460
Fu Yancheng.

47
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,930
Wake up. Wake up.

48
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,750
Fu Yancheng.

49
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,020
I'll do anything you say as long as you wake up.

50
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,340
Do you mean it?

51
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,930
♫  Dreaming of you, thinking of you, loving you  ♫

52
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:35,210
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

53
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,210
♫  You are the only one I need  ♫

54
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,490
♫  You are the only one I want  ♫

55
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,420
♫  You are the only one I see  ♫

56
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:51,390
♫  The only dream I dream is always you  ♫

57
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
The doctor said that you're recuperating.

58
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,220
You should drink more milk, it's good for your health.

59
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,430
Can I not drink it?

60
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,320
I haven't drunk this since I was three years old.

61
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,410
I don't like the smell.

62
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,130
Well, can you just make an exception for me?

63
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,800
Is this funny?

64
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,350
What?

65
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,850
Penny,

66
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,840
I know ending a marriage isn't easy,

67
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,030
but all I want to say is that as long as we're together,

68
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,470
I really don't want anything else.

69
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,600
But there's one more thing I need to explain to you.

70
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
What is it?

71
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,870
Xiao Chuqing and I really are just friends.

72
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,950
You don't need to explain that to me. I trust you.

73
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,910
 Boss, when you're done with Miss Penny, can you show me some concern? 

74
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,600
- Are you dead? 
   - Not yet, but my leg is broken. 

75
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,240
 President Fu, you need to find another special assistant 

76
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,280
 to look after you for the time being. 

77
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,960
Good morning, President Fu.

78
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,020
Good morning.

79
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,830
We've agreed. I'll only do this for two weeks,

80
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,850
and I'll leave after Qi Chen is back. Deal?

81
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,720
All right. Thank you so much, great designer.

82
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,960
What do you need me to do?

83
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,030
There's a new product launch in a few days,

84
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,080
and Qi Chen's been in charge of this each year.

85
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,250
Your main task this time is...

86
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,150
I hope that you can separate work from private matters, President Fu.

87
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,050
I can't do that.

88
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,190
 President Fu, do I need to send the planning for the southern city to Penny? 

89
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,390
That won't be necessary.

90
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,960
I've already read it.

91
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,870
Just change the team.

92
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,270
Don't waste my time.

93
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,240
If changing a team doesn't work, then just close the deal.

94
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,050
President Fu, you just did all my work.

95
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,650
So, who's the special assistant here?

96
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,160
If it's fine with you, I can be your special assistant for life.

97
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,320
Then I need to know if you can handle it or not.

98
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,270
You know my capabilities the best.

99
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,080
Stay here tonight. Don't go home.

100
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,180
What? Overtime work?

101
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,260
I'll prove my capabilities to you.

102
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,230
 Did I wake you? 

103
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,080
I have a meeting today, so I'm leaving early.

104
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,750
You can sleep more if you feel tired.

105
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,570
I hurt everywhere.

106
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,440
All right, I'll be more gentle next time.

107
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,390
I'll be back after the meeting.

108
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,930
I understand; go about your business.

109
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,550
Are you going have this meeting or not?

110
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,490
 Hello, Penny! Our studio's crisis is resolved! 

111
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,510
 You need to thank President Fu for me. 

112
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,000
 And you won't have to work for the time being. 

113
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,480
Just stay with President Fu as his special assistant

114
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,320
and take really good care of him.

115
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,390
I'll take good care of him.

116
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,790
Good, that would be great.

117
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,070
I'll hang up now.

118
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,160
   

119
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
You are seven weeks pregnant.

120
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,080
Have you never felt anything?

121
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,480
Tell your husband to reduce the frequency of intercourse.

122
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
Have more restraint.

123
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,240
There are already slight risks of miscarriage.

124
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,840
Do you understand?

125
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,870
I understand, doctor.

126
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,210
 Fu Yancheng, we are going to have a baby together. 

127
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,240
 I will never marry that woman from the Sheng family. 

128
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,080
 He hates the Sheng family so much. 

129
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,020
 Will he even want a baby that carries the Sheng family blood? 

130
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,550
Mom.

131
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,970
I've got optimistic results this time, so you don't have to worry.

132
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,280
Sheng Mian?

133
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,440
What is she doing here?

134
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,150
Gynecology?

135
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,990
Please come in.

136
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,150
- Hello, doctor. 
 - And you are?

137
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,380
I'm the younger sister of the woman who just left.

138
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,260
It's like this. My older sister has severe depression.

139
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,170
I want to know if something is wrong with her.

140
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,870
And as her family, what can we do for her?

141
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,550
She has depression?

142
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,550
Then you should really care for her more.

143
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,580
She's pregnant. You must not let her do anything that will hurt her.

144
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,200
Okay, thank you.

145
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,440
 Sheng Mian, good play. 

146
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,080
 Now you're secretly pregnant with Fu Yancheng's child. 

147
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,870
 Do you think that this will give you the position as the young Mrs. Fu? 

148
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,750
 As your little sister, I'm going to give you a great congratulatory gift. 

149
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:10,000

♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,460
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

163
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:30,860
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
