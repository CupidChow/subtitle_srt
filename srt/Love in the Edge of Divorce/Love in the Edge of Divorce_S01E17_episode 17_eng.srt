3
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,360
   

4
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:50,579
No!

5
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,100
Fu Yancheng is the child's father.

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
I see you're just grasping at straws out of desperation.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,040
Yancheng hates you to the core!

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,319
How dare you lie about him being the father!

9
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,359
Auntie, let me explain.

10
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,280
The child is really Fu Yancheng's.

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,259
If you don't believe me, call him and check!

12
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,280
Mom?

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,879
Yancheng, I'm in the hospital right now.

14
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,280
Your wife, Sheng Mian, is pregnant.

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,599
She says the child is yours.

16
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:45,500
Mom, I've never slept with her.

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,480
Fu Yancheng, I'm...

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,900
Hear that?

19
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,000
Yancheng said the child has nothing to do with the Fu family.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,359
He will never allow a child of the Fu family to carry the blood of the Sheng family.

21
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,059
Do it!

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,500
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

23
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,260
No! Don't come closer!

24
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,239
Don't come closer! No!

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,980
Don't come closer!

26
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,520
Let her go! I've called the police!

27
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:30,400
Penny. Penny.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
It's fine, Penny.

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm here.

30
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,000
 Hanqing, Fu Yancheng's mother suddenly called 

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,879
 and asked me to visit a hospital. 

32
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,520
 I suspect it might be a trick. 

33
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,159
 I messaged you the address. 

34
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,079
 If I don't respond with any messages, please come and pick me up. 

35
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,000
Finally, you're back.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,360
I couldn't get through to you on the phone, so I had to wait for you here.

37
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,320
I was very worried about you.

38
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,960
What's wrong?

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,400
You don't look well. What happened to you?

40
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,279
Your wife, Sheng Mian, is pregnant.

41
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,260
Why are you still in the mood to care about me?

42
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,320
She came to see you?

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,919
What a vicious woman.

44
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,360
She would do anything to stay in the Fu family.

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
Penny,

46
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,199
I have never had any relationship with her.

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,159
Can you really turn a blind eye

48
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,159
to whatever happens to Sheng Mian?

49
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:10,380
Would you even glance at her...

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,299
if she were to die right in front of you?

51
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,519
Sheng Mian is a scheming person.

52
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,120
She pretends to be pitiful and fragile just to make you leave me.

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,379
I don't even know where she got that child from.

54
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,580
Penny,

55
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,539
can you please not fall into her trap?

56
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,460
Fu Yancheng,

57
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,580
how long are you going to humiliate me?

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,600
Penny.

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,639
Don't pay attention to her nonsense.

60
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,660
I'm not the father of that child.

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,839
If it were?

62
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,460
If it were mine, I definitely wouldn't want them either.

63
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,960
It sounds so... mocking.

64
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,359
Penny.

65
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,619
Don't touch me!

66
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,079
 President Fu, 

67
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,819
 starting from tomorrow, I won't come to work anymore. 

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,399
President Fu, you were looking for me?

69
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,780
After recuperating for so long, it's time to get busy again.

70
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,279
Terminate all projects with the Sheng family.

71
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,940
One more thing.

72
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,339
Find a way to sever all ties between the old master and the Sheng family.

73
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,600
President Fu, aren't you going a bit too far this time?

74
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,519
Since Sheng Mian chose to do this,

75
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,319
she should accept these punishments.

76
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,000
What did Miss Sheng Mian do to offend you?

77
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,279
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

78
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,780
Yes, sir.

79
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,279
What? The Fu family terminated all cooperation with us?

80
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,000
How could this be?

81
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,060
Dad! Dad!

82
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,380
What's the matter, Dad?

83
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,040
- Are you okay? 
 - Mian Mian.

84
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,930
I'm calling 911 right now.

85
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,920
   

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,299
 Your father has had a weak heart, 

87
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:52,339
 and the added stress has worsened his condition. 

88
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:54,659
 The current situation is very unfavorable, 

89
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,020
 so you need to be prepared. 

90
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,480
Dad.

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,560
You'll be fine.

92
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
 Sheng Mian, since you're pregnant with someone else's child, 

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,079
how dare you still cling to the Fu family!

94
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,079
Hurry up and get the divorce done.

95
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,279
 Mian Mian, 

96
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,519
 it's me and the Sheng family who owe you an apology, 

97
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,880
 for causing you to be treated so disdainfully by the Fu family. 

98
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Lawyer Wang,

99
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,360
I want to make a will.

100
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
Su Lan, what's going on?

101
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,000
Why did you transfer all the money in the company's account?

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,399
Isn't this your fault?

103
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,879
You offended the Fu family.

104
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,940
Fu Group is almost forcing the Sheng family into bankruptcy.

105
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,179
I took the money to fill the financial gap.

106
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:25,920
I don't want to be chased by creditors every day.

107
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,020
I don't want to hear your lame excuses.

108
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,900
My dad is still lying in the hospital waiting for money to save his life.

109
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,799
If you still have any conscience, you should take out the money.

110
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,240
Instead of wasting your time here with me,

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,259
you should think about how else you can raise money.

112
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,279
How is he?

113
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,679
He just fell into a coma.

114
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,519
That old devil actually left all his property to that little wretch Sheng Mian.

115
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,939
We need to make plans earlier.

116
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,080
Don't worry.

117
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm here.

118
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,600
After Sheng Zhong dies, we don't have to keep our affair a secret anymore.

119
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,559
Hanqing, I'm in urgent need of money.

120
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,000
How much money is there in the company's account?

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
How much do you need?

122
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,639
My father's surgery requires ¥2 million.

123
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,080
I have ¥1 million now.

124
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm still ¥1 million short.

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,759
That's not a small bill.

126
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,579
You know our company well. We're just starting to improve.

127
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:51,360
 If we have to secure such a large amount of cash at one time, 

128
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
we might have to sell the company.

129
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,120
I don't have time for that. I'll think of some way.

130
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:14,725
   

131
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,980
 Sorry, the number you dialed is busy now. 

132
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,100
 Please try again later. 

133
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,639
 Sorry, the number you dialed is busy now. 

134
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,440
 Please try again later. 

135
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,159
Auntie, I have an urgent matter to discuss with Grandfather.

136
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm begging you to let me in.

137
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,740
You've embarrassed the Fu family with your pregnancy,

138
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,620
and you still have the nerve to come see Grandfather.

139
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,000
Sheng Mian, you're shameless!

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,159
Auntie, my dad is in the hospital and urgently needs money.

141
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,400
Please, if you let me see Grandfather. I'll do whatever you ask.

142
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,519
Let me tell you, I'm not Grandfather.

143
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,679
Acting pitiful won't work on me.

144
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,240
Sheng Mian, from now on, the Sheng family will not give you a single penny.

145
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,559
You won't be seeing Grandfather again.

146
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,160
Auntie! Auntie!

147
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:55,020

 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

149
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:11,950
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

150
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:19,280
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

151
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,850
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

152
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:33,600
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

153
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,180
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

154
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:48,830
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

155
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,710
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

156
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,310
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

159
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,760
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

160
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,700
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫
