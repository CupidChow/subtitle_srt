1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:09,920


2
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,460
   

3
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,520
   

4
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,479
President Fu, all the preparations have been confirmed.

5
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,819
Qi Chen is still recuperating from his injury. Thanks to your hard work.

6
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,539
Yancheng!

7
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,040
Penny, is Yancheng overworking you,

8
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,279
assigning you both design tasks and duties as a special assistant?

9
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,439
Thank you so much.

10
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,340
It's no issue. Able people have more responsibilities.

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,880
The press conference is about to start. Let's go.

12
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,400
Good morning, distinguished guests.

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,879
Welcome to Fu Group's press conference.

14
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,860
It's my honor to introduce the new products created by Fu Group.

15
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,639
In this era of innovation and change,

16
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,400
Fu Group has been committed to delivering

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,880
the most cutting-edge and influential products to the public.

18
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,560
Fu Group aims to lead the industry forward

19
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,019
and hopes to collaborate with all guests to create an even brighter future.

20
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,800
Penny, how I wish I could stand beside you with a different identity.

21
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,379
 Was what I said so disgusting? 

22
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,200
 Penny, how I wish I could stand beside you with a different identity. 

23
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:01,020
 Baby, it's time to tell your father the truth. 

24
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,639
Penny, stop using your inferior tactics to seduce Yancheng.

25
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,959
You know the consequences of being a mistress.

26
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,999
Shouldn't this be something that's said to you?

27
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,839
After all, President Fu is already married,

28
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,279
yet you are eagerly trying to become his mistress.

29
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,820
You!

30
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,859
Xiao Chuqing!

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
What's your problem?

32
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,940
I am Sheng Weiyuan, the second daughter of the Sheng family.

33
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,959
My sister is Sheng Mian.

34
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,999
My brother-in-law is Fu Yancheng.

35
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,839
How shameless you are!

36
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,100
You actually want to interfere in my sister's marriage and steal her husband.

37
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,000
Go to the press conference and figure out who is actually trying to seduce your brother-in-law!

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,959
My sister, Penny, is a talented designer in Xinrui Group.

39
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,980
They are not only legally married, but also a great match in their work.

40
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,580
What are you saying? Penny is actually Sheng Mian?

41
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,800
Let me tell you something. My sister is pregnant with his child.

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
Don't even think about trying to come between them.

43
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,920
What did you say?

44
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,040
I said, my sister is pregnant with Fu Yancheng's child.

45
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,959
You'll never succeed in stealing him away.

46
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,100
 Smart people never need to dirty their hands when they want something. 

47
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,700
 Sister, let's see if you can really protect Fu Yancheng's child. 

48
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
 Everyone knows Yancheng hates Sheng Mian. 

49
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,800
 He probably doesn't know Penny is Sheng Mian. 

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,519
 I can't let the Fu family know 

51
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,680
 that Sheng Mian is pregnant Fu Yancheng's child.  

52
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
- Chuqing. 
 - Aunt.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
Why are you here to visit me again today?

54
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,520
Didn't we just have tea yesterday?

55
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,160
Aunt, I came today because I heard something

56
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,480
that tarnishes the reputation of the Fu family.

57
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,079
I'm not sure if I should tell you about it.

58
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:04,119
Tell me who dares to tarnish the reputation of the Fu family.

59
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:07,079
It's your son's wife, Sheng Mian.

60
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,000
That insignificant woman from the Sheng family?

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,519
What's happened with her?

62
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,800
She...

63
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,720
She is pregnant.

64
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,040
What?

65
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,560
You also know how much Yancheng hates Sheng Mian.

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,040
This child cannot possibly be from the Fu family.

67
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,600
As for whose it is, I don't know.

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,840
But I've heard that Sheng Mian's personal life is really promiscuous.

69
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,399
Maybe she doesn't even know who the father of her child is.

70
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,720
How dare she!

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,000
Despite the Fu family being respectful

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,719
and secretly helping the Sheng family numerous times,

73
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,040
she actually dares to have an affair.

74
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
Just to be on the safe side,

75
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
it'd be best if you could personally confirm whether she is pregnant.

76
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,879
Help me check Sheng Mian's medical records.

77
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,839
Don't worry.

78
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,500
Maybe what I heard was just a rumor, and she didn't betray the Fu family.

79
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,079
Okay, I understand.

80
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,879
Sheng Mian actually cheated on Yancheng!

81
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,399
And she is pregnant with an illegitimate child!

82
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,639
That wretch!

83
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,220
She absolutely must not keep this child.

84
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,759
- Hello 
 - Do you have some free time tomorrow?

85
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,759
I'd like you to go to Royal View Garden with me

86
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,279
to confirm a few decoration details on site.

87
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,979
It's up to you. I like everything that you like.

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,160
I should decide?

89
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,480
What if the lady of the house doesn't like it?

90
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,520
How could she not like it if she chose it herself?

91
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,100
So, it seems that my taste aligns quite well with Ms. Sheng's.

92
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,559
Why mention her?

93
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,460
President Fu.

94
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,639
After all, you and Ms. Sheng are already husband and wife.

95
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,879
Was there some misunderstanding between you?

96
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,480
 A misunderstanding? 

97
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,039
 She deceived my grandfather to marry me. 

98
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,919
 How could there be any misunderstanding? 

99
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,119
- Actually, I... 
 - What's wrong?

100
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,639
Nothing.

101
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,200
I'll come to find you tomorrow evening.

102
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,160
I have something to talk to you about.

103
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,659
Okay.

104
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,919
 I'm sick and in the hospital. 

105
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,040
 As the daughter-in-law of the Fu family, 

106
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,240
 shouldn't you come to the hospital to take care of your mother-in-law? 

107
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,000
 Is this how the Sheng family teaches their daughters? 

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,899
Okay, I'll be there right away.

109
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,320
It is right here.

110
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,659
How could someone be hospitalized in such a remote place?

111
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,039
Is anyone there?

112
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,279
Help!

113
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,080
Is anyone there? Help!

114
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,440
Help!

115
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Is anyone there?

116
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,240
Help!

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
Auntie!

118
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,120
What are you doing here?

119
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,559
What am I doing?

120
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,520
I want to know why you betrayed Yancheng and had an affair,

121
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,720
trampling on the dignity of the Fu family.

122
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,000
Over those years, we helped you so much.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,080
Yet, you dare to have an affair with someone else.

124
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,600
You even got pregnant with an illegitimate child.

125
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,240
Do you think all of us in the Fu family are dead?

126
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,879
No, I didn't. Let me explain, Auntie.

127
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,279
- I didn't. 
 - Don't try to make excuses.

128
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,599
- I'm telling you. No matter how persuasive your words are, 
 - I didn't...

129
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:56,620
Today, you must get rid of that illegitimate child in your belly.

130
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,000
Do it!

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,479
No.

132
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,900
No. No.

133
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,199
No.

134
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,139
Fu Yancheng is the child's father.

135
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:23,990


136
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,980
