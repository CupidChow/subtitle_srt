1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:17,060


2
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,670
   

3
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,230
   

4
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:53,205
   

5
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,280
Hey, Penny. What's up?

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,040
 Send me Lan Yang's design proposal. 

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,400
All right, I'll send it to you right away.

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,840
By the way, Penny, do you know where I am right now?

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,580
Where are you?

10
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,439
 I'm already at Fu Yancheng's house. 

11
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,560
 President Fu invited me over for drinks tonight. 

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,699
 Oh no! I haven't told Liang Hanqing about the fake husband thing yet! 

13
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:22,059
I'm coming over right now.

14
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:23,359
I happen to have something to discuss with you.

15
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,959
All right, I'll wait for you. Bye.

16
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,839
It is truly an honor for me that you've chosen our small studio to design your villa.

17
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,959
Director Liang, you're being too modest.

18
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,559
With someone as talented as Penny on your team,

19
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:48,540
I admire you not only for your career but also for your family life.

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,040
Indeed.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,779
Fam... Family?

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,640
Hanqing!

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm here.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,120
Penny, why are you so late?

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Come and sit down!

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,439
President Fu and I were just having a great conversation.

27
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,640
President Fu, what made you suddenly think of inviting Hanqing over for drinks tonight?

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,400
Well, Director Liang has contributed so much to Royal View Garden.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,120
So, I certainly had to invite him over as a special guest.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,939
I appreciate it, thank you.

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm curious, how did you two meet?

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
Penny and I met back in college.

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
Back then, Penny was exceptional in both academics and character.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,260
Not only did she excel in her studies, but she also took on part-time jobs.

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,840
Even then, I predicted Penny would surely achieve great things in the future.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
But to my surprise, after graduation,

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,499
she turned down offers from major companies to start a business with me.

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,680
When you and Penny started working together,

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,240
did you ever think you'd take things further?

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,519
Take things further?

41
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,280
Yes, not only did we take things further,

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,079
but we also took many steps forward.

43
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,919
Didn't we, Hanqing?

44
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,760
Yes! And we're continuing to make progress!

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,840
Here. Cheers to that, cheers to you! Cheers!

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,280
Indeed, when I first interacted with you two,

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,779
I didn't realize you were husband and wife.

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,199
We keep it low-key to avoid gossip.

49
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,240
You know how it is.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,380
Sometimes, mixing work and personal life can get messy.

51
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,240
How could you be so careless?

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Let me wipe that for you.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,599
Pretend we're a couple.

54
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,799
Don't let him find out.

55
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,820
I'll explain later.

56
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,600
Don't drink too much.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,580
President Fu, Penny said I shouldn't drink too much.

58
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,560
Drinking less is good advice.

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,699
Are you cold?

60
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,140
I'm fine, President Fu.

61
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,080
You don't have to do this, really.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,660
Don't move.

63
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,060
President Fu, are you cold?

64
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,959
Here, wear my jacket.

65
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,599
The Fu Group's hot spring hotel opens next week.

66
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,480
It has many relaxing facilities.

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
You must come!

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
There's no need, President Fu.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,279
I've reserved a spot for you, too.

70
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,939
You should come, too.

71
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,460
Such a real man!

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,699
Penny, don't you think this is a bad idea?

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,639
He's here.

74
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,299
Smile.

75
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:20,739
I can't smile.

76
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,220
Smile anyway.

77
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,360
I...

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,819
Are you okay, honey?

79
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,800
Come here, let me see.

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,379
Come over here.

81
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,780
Are you all right?

82
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't move.

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,879
Hug me.

84
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,100
Hug me, quick!

85
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:14,459
Now. Immediately. Come to the lounge right away.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,880
Is he gone?

87
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,279
He's gone.

88
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,560
- Are we going to get caught? 
 - I don't think so.

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,179
We're far away, he can't see us.

90
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:32,320
All right. I'll go get some drinks.

91
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,959
Sir, I'm sorry. But there's an issue with the A-Zone pool.

92
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,839
It needs repairs. Please use the B-Zone pool.

93
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,759
- This way, please. 
 - It was fine just a moment ago.

94
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,880
Why did it suddenly…

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Wait.

96
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,920
♫  Time never stops  ♫ 
 ♫   Running back and forth making a trail  ♫

97
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:07,420
♫  You stir up ripples again and again  ♫ 
 ♫  I keep smoothing them out  ♫

98
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:14,290
♫  It's the gift of a lover's poem  ♫ 
 ♫  Lingering in the mind  ♫

99
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:20,400
♫  Destined and miraculous  ♫ 
 ♫  The whole world is you  ♫

100
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,350
♫  You... it was always you  ♫

101
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:33,760
♫  It's not a secret; it was only you  ♫

102
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,280
♫   I hear you. I see you. I follow you  ♫

103
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:47,030
♫  Because of you, my life begins to have shadow and light  ♫

104

00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:03,640
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

106
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
What are you doing?

107
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,360
This is the women's changing room!

108
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,480
Are you crazy?

109
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,680
What do you even see in Liang Hanqing?

110
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,440
I have looks and wealth, in what way am I any worse than him?

111
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,420
 Penny! Penny! 

112
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,900
Are you okay?

113
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,279
I'm fine.

114
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,159
Go on out.

115
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,680
I'll wait for you outside.

116
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,219
President Fu, you seem preoccupied.

117
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:54,120
Qi Chen, I have a friend.

118
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,480
The woman he likes ignores him and is always with her husband.

119
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,879
President Fu, in my opinion, you should...

120
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,799
No, your friend should make that woman work late with him.

121
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,320
That way, she'll be away from her husband.

122
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,960
After that, your friend just needs to make a move,

123
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,499
and it'll surely work out.

124
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,120
President Fu.

125
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,399
I'm really sorry to call you over so late.

126
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,679
I hope I didn't disturb your treasured time with your husband.

127
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,139
It's fine, President Fu. It's part of my job.

128
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,580
Have a seat.

129
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:47,680
I called you over so urgently because I wanted to discuss the decor style of Royal View Garden.

130
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,779
I had a sudden burst of inspiration. You know how inspiration is,

131
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,720
once it strikes, it needs to be acted on immediately

132
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,440
so that the two of us can spark ideas and creativity together.

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,679
I understand.

134
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,379
Please go ahead, President Fu.

135
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,579
For the living room's design, I'm thinking of an ancient Egyptian style.

136
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,980
For the furniture, I want low-profile pieces.

137
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,240
Smooth-edged wooden ones with simple lines.

138
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,100
For the flooring, I'm considering terracotta or stone tiles.

139
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,459
As for the bedroom design, I'd like an ancient Roman style.

140
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,960
Minimalistic and bold.

141
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:28,260
For materials, we can use trendy cedar wood to fully showcase my austerity.

142
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,500
President Fu, the living room style you mentioned is actually Mediterranean.

143
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,200
What you described for the bedroom is ancient Egyptian.

144
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,999
Well, as humans, inspiration can sometimes be flawed.

145
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,080
I understand. So, to summarize,

146
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,279
you want me to redesign the entire Royal View Garden.

147
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,759
Right?

148
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,919
Exactly.

149
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,559
No problem.

150
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,759
President Fu.

151
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,539
I've updated the design proposal and sent it to your email.

152
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:27,120
Since my work is done, I'll take my leave now.

153
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,380
Who said our work is done?

154
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,139
You'll need to review these for reference.

155
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,599
We're on a tight schedule with a heavy workload.

156
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,979
You'll have to work overtime here for the next few days.

157
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,759
I promise I'll get it done.

158
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,860
 You're just using this as an excuse to get back at me. 

159
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,379
 How petty! 

160
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,170
   

161
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:08,020


162

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:29,170
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

165
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,710
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

166
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:43,370
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

167
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:51,040
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

168
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,630
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

169
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,560
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

170
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,300
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

171
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,140
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

172
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,740
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

173
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,690
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

174
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,590
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

175
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:29,920
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
