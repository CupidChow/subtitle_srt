1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:10,570


2
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,540
   

3
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,440
   

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,890
Thank you for today.

5
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,960
If you two hadn't arrived in time,

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,200
I really don't know what would have happened.

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,240
Xiao Yang didn't succeed today. He might come after you again.

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,990
Sheng Mian, why don't you stay at my house?

9
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,430
Wen Zhao, what's wrong?

10
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,150
Do you feel bad?

11
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,590
It's true I don't feel too good.

12
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,980
My chest is stuffy. I can hardly breathe.

13
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,950
What's wrong with you?

14
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,430
I got hit in the head today.

15
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,120
It hurts so bad. Maybe there are lingering effects.

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,870
My chest is so stuffy. I can't breathe.

17
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,770
And my heart hurts now, too.

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,710
My chest hurts.

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,640
I can't move my arms.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
I think my arm is broken.

21
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,560
Oh, I can't feel my legs.

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,710
I... Am I paralyzed?

23
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,610
Am I really paralyzed?

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,510
Here are the x-ray results of your physical examination.

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,760
Both of you are fine. Just a few scrapes.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,430
You'll be fine with some ointment.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Uh... Sheng Mian,

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,070
it's late. Let me take you home.

29
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,800
Okay.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,240
Let's go.

31
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,420
Take care.

32
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,330
Thanks for driving me home today.

33
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,210
It's late. You should go back home.

34
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,800
All right. I'll watch you go in and then leave.

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,240
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

36
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,280
Welcome home.

37
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,980
How did you get in here?

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,300
We are legally married now.

39
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,780
I definitely got in here legally.

40
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,700
Forget about how I got in.

41
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,460
You must not have eaten all evening. Hurry, try this.

42
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,760
Did you make all this yourself?

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,430
Try it.

44
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,280
What happened to your finger?

45
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,520
It's okay. I cut myself a little while cooking.

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,320
You should be careful.

47
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,670
If my guess isn't wrong,

48
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,680
This one must be... the shredded bamboo shoots of Maqiji Restaurant.

49
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,160
And this one must be the stewed chicken from Wangtiange Restaurant.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,140
This must be the poached spicy sliced pork of Taiji Restaurant.

51
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,750
As for this one, I've had it, too.

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,000
So, which one did you cook, President Fu?

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
Sheng Mian,

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,120
I just wanted you to have something warm to eat.

55
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,010
So, I ordered the dishes you like from your favorite restaurants.

56
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,950
But what happened to your finger?

57
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,770
I did cook for you.

58
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,360
I cut some fruits.

59
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,330
They are in the refrigerator now.

60
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,830
Where's the wound?

61
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,160
Hey, I'm a man.

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,890
It's just a small wound. It heals quickly.

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,340
Give it to me.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,430
What?

65
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,290
Give me the key to my house.

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,460
I'm not giving it to you.

67
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,730
Then I'll move out.

68
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,580
Stop pretending. The doctor said you're fine.

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,120
He can make mistakes.

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,070
And I only did some of the examinations.

71
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,420
Maybe there's something else wrong with me.

72
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,710
My chest hurts now. And my heart hurts, too.

73
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,780
I can't breathe.

74
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,620
A heart issue?

75
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,600
You must be tired from acting so dramatically.

76
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,630
Your acting is no good.

77
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,240
You should practice more.

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,630
The doctor said you're fine. Just some scrapes.

79
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,630
Don't take me for a fool.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,780
I mean... I didn't do every single examination.

81
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,650
In all of history, no man would say he's hurt in front of his rivals.

82
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,620
A man only presents his real soul in front of his true lover.

83
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,560
All right.

84
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,300
Then, I'll call Qi Chen. He can take you to the hospital.

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,230
You should have a full physical examination.

86
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,870
That's okay. I can lie down on your bed.

87
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,310
Fu Yancheng! Get back here!

88
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,240
Fu Yancheng, why did you come into my bedroom?

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,080
Sheng Mian, your bed is so soft.

90
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,630
I don't think I feel any pain now.

91
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,930
Get up. Get up now!

92
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,660
Stop pretending! Get up!

93
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,120
Who said I'm pretending?

94
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,340
Lovesickness is also a real ailment.

95
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,870
Your scent is my medicine.

96
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,820
Fine, smell it as much as you want.

97
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,920
I have informed the major customers inside the country and abroad.

98
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,240
They're all willing to sign with us. The KPI shouldn't be a problem.

99
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,820
What's the matter? What are you thinking about?

100
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,240
My dad always had a dream.

101
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,050
He wanted to design a fabric for children that is eco-friendly, waterproof, and breathable.

102
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,010
But that wish hasn't come true. And now, he's passed away.

103
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,800
Wen Zhao, can we...

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,510
Sheng Mian, we have to focus on the KPI for this month.

105
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,840
Now isn't the time to put money and time into the research.

106
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,190
I understand.

107
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,140
Sheng Mian, don't worry.

108
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,900
I'll do my best to help you with the KPI.

109
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,260
As for other things,

110
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,710
we can do that later after you gradually adapt to this new position.

111
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,850
- Is that okay? 
 - Okay.

112
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,680
Then, I'll get back to work.

113
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,630
 Mian Mian, did you and Yancheng have a fight? 

114
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,020
 He came back and took his passport. 

115
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,950
 He didn't say where he was going. 

116
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,520
The airline said he went to Europe and North America.

117
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,600
He almost went all over the world.

118
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Did something happen?

119
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,100
 Everything was fine during our video call. 

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,070
Grandfather, don't worry.

121
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,000
Our relationship is fine.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,950
 He must have some emergency. 

123
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,600
All right, I'm glad to hear that.

124
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,270
Okay.

125
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,670
I wonder what Fu Yancheng's been up to lately.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,120
Why is he on my mind?

127
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,390
 Haven't I wanted to sever ties with him? 

128
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,270
 Now, that it's finally happening, 

129
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,290
 I should be happy. 

130
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,320
 Michel Company developed a new three-in-one fabric 

131
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,620
 that is eco-friendly, waterproof, and breathable. 

132
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,870
 And it applied for a patent. 

133
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,600
Did you miss me?

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,080
You?

135
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,110
♫  It begins to have light and shadow  ♫

136
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,600
♫  Blinded by you, thinking of you, loving you  ♫

137
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,870
♫  You are you.  ♫ 
 ♫  So I give you my fate  ♫

138
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,690
Is that what you've wanted?

139
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,260
How did you know I wanted this fabric?

140
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,500
If I want something, there's nothing I can't find out.

141
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,000
Because of you, I've been through a lot for this fabric.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,790
Look and see if this is right.

143
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,550
♫  Time never stops  ♫

144
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,900
♫  Running back and forth making a trail  ♫

145
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,530
♫  You stir up ripples again and again  ♫ 
  ♫  I keep smoothing them out  ♫

146
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,900
♫  It's the gift of a lover's poem  ♫

147
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,650
♫  Lingering in the mind  ♫

148
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,910
You haven't said yet whether you missed me or not.

149
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,280
I thought about you.

150
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,690
I can't even remember who you are.

151
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,100
♫  It's not a secret; it was only you  ♫

152
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,780
It's look like it's time to stir up your memories.

153
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:54,290
♫  Dreaming of you, thinking of you, loving you  ♫

154
00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:02,080
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

155
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,510
♫  You are the only one I need  ♫

156
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,900
♫  You are the only one I want  ♫

157
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,170
♫  You are the only one I see  ♫

158
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,750
♫  You are the only one I dream  ♫

159
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,910
I can't breathe.

160
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,190
Give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

161
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,140
Stop joking.

162
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,270
I have an important meeting tomorrow.

163
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,050
I have to go to work.

164
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,960
♫  The only dream I dream is always you  ♫

165
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,390
President Sheng has only been on the job for half a month.

166
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,910
But the KPI has increased by 25 percent.

167
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,720
I believe that with President Sheng's leadership,

168
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,920
our Sheng Group will reach new heights.

169
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,650
Well, President Sheng can you please explain?

170
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,640
With this high number of orders,

171
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,810
why have our annual interest rates fallen so much?

172
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,690
I took some of the funds

173
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,270
to purchase patented fabrics from the Michel Company.

174
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,670
That was my dad's dream.

175
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,980
You bought the patent.

176
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,450
Do you know how much a patent costs?

177
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,220
This is not your own personal company.

178
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,460
You'd better not pay for your own dreams at the expense of the shareholders.

179
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,080
The one-month probation isn't over yet.

180
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,280
Sheng Group is still led by Sheng Mian.

181
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,000
As far as I'm concerned, Sheng Mian's probation can be ended early.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,160
Let's see who dares to do that.

183
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:36,050


184
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,200
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

185
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,940
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

186
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:56,330
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

187
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:04,000
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

188
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,670
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

189
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:18,290
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

190
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,860
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

191
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,760
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

192
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,530
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

193
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,380
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

194
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,190
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

195
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,970
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

196
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,730
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

197
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:56,990
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
