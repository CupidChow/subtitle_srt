1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:09,780


2
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,480
   

3
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,430
   

4
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,180
Fu Yancheng.

5
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,980
   

6
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,279
 When he officially became president of the Fu Group, he was only 24. 

7
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:24,120
 He secured the highly sought-after Western Suburbs Renovation Project 

8
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,439
 and became the youngest well-known entrepreneur in the country.  
    

9
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,839
Not bad, right?

10
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,560
That's my grandson.

11
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,879
What do you think, Mian Mian?

12
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,800
He's a good match for you, isn't he?

13
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,240
Thanks to you, I got my life back this time.

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,360
I don't have much with which to repay you,

15
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,719
so let my grandson marry you.

16
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,479
- But... 
 - As a wedding gift,

17
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,520
Fu Group will invest ¥300 million in your Sheng Group.

18
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,840
I don't want to get married.

19
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,380
Then forget it.

20
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,759
I just think that marrying into the Fu family would make your life more secure. 
    

21
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,800
Don't worry, I'll figure something else out for the company. 
    

22
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
Even if it costs me my life,

23
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,439
I won't let your mom's hard work from back then go to waste.

24
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,479
Dad.

25
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,440
It's okay.

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,400
Your happiness matters most.

27
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,999
Dad.

28
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,280
I'll do it.

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,540
Mian Mian, something came up for Yancheng. He can't make it back for now.

30
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,840
I'm sorry for letting you down.

31
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,520
   

32
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,439
 I didn't meet with Fu Yancheng for the three years after we got married. 

33
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,579
 Who would expect our first meeting to be in bed? 

34
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,960
 But, why did we sleep together? 

35
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,360
 Mian Mian. 

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
 Why are you here alone? 

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,839
 You've been married to Fu Yancheng for so long without meeting him. 

38
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:05,639
 Now that he's finally back, shouldn't you go and say hello to him? 

39
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,759
 - But... 
 - You're his wife. 

40
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,639
 Besides, we're about to start our second round of financing. 

41
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,559
 You need to get Fu Yancheng to help your dad, right? 

42
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,959
 Could there have been something wrong with the wine? 

43
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,439
 Never mind. 

44
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,820
 Whatever the reason, it isn't the right time to face him now. 

45
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,480
 I'd better just leave. 

46
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,879
How much?

47
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,879
- I don't want money. 
 - You don't want money?

48
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,640
Are you planning to cling to me?

49
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,800
I'll give you no less than what you're owed.

50
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,279
But don't get any ideas you shouldn't.

51
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,340
I know you're rich. But I don't need money.

52
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,759
Last night... just take it that we were satisfying our mutual needs.

53
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,779
 Yancheng, since you're back, hurry and get a divorce. 

54
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,400
 It's been three years. It's time to end this. 

55
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,639
I know.

56
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,720
The Sheng family sold their daughter.

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,199
I'll definitely divorce her.

58
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,079
 Sold their daughter? 

59
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,319
 So, this is how he's always seen our marriage. 

60
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,639
 Then there's no need to explain further. 

61
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,119
Let's just pretend nothing happened last night.

62
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,959
Playing hard to get won't work on me.

63
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,439
Take the money and leave.

64
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,639
And when you leave this room, I want you to forget everything.

65
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,279
I'm not as rich as you are, but don't look down on me.

66
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,219
Take this penny. That's how much you're worth.

67
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,879
Stop!

68
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,739
 That was her first time. 

69
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
    
    

70
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,119
Last night, you were the one who tampered with my drink.

71
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,839
Was Fu Yancheng satisfied with you?

72
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,439
Did he say when he'd help with our second round of financing?

73
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,720
You might be disappointed.

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,059
I didn't take a cent from Fu Yancheng.

75
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm not like you, relying on men for everything.

76
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,700
You!

77
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:08,040
I already agreed to divorce Fu Yancheng.

78
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,199
I'm warning you, stay out of my business from now on.

79
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,160
Divorce? How could you be so selfish!

80
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,319
If Wei Yuan were healthy and not so frail,

81
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,239
would such a good marriage with the Fu family have fallen to you?

82
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,800
And now you dare mention divorce?

83
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,860
You should think about how to get the Fu family to help us more.

84
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,360
Mom.

85
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,139
Don't say that about her. She has it hard, too.

86
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,820
Wei Yuan, why are you out here? How are you feeling?

87
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,800
The doctor said if the results are optimistic,

88
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,759
I can have the surgery soon.

89
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
Then I can help the family more in the future.

90
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,459
Silly child, as long as you're healthy, your father and I will be satisfied.

91
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,820
Go back inside. It's chilly out here.

92
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,319
Go in.

93
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,160
Hello, Aunt Fu.

94
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,040
You aren't qualified to call me aunt.

95
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Call me Madam Bai. 
    

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
Madam Bai.

97
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,879
 Come to the Fu house right now. 

98
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,439
 Don't think you'll have chances just because Yancheng is back. 

99
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,240
Listen. He's come back in order to divorce you.

100
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,639
 - If you're smart...   
 - Okay, I'm coming right now.

101
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,119
What?

102
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay, fine.

103
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,959
 I've called Yancheng, too. 

104
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,879
 He'll be here soon, too. 

105
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,720
President Fu, we've bought the house you liked.

106
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,840
We've also shortlisted some good design firms.

107
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,719
This house is very important to me.

108
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,440
Make sure it's designed well.

109
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
Yes, sir.

110
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,759
President Fu, are we really going to discuss divorce with Sheng Mian?

111
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,739
You've never even met her, and you're going to divorce her.

112
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:53,679
What if you find out that you like her?

113
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,559
Impossible. She's just a materialistic woman.

114
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,600
Didn't she only marry me for that ¥300 million?

115
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,639
Aren't you afraid you'll regret it?

116
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,919
What if you like her after you meet her?

117
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,839
If there are layoffs, you'll be the first to go.

118
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:22,560
You must know this. Back then, you could marry Yancheng only because of the elder Fu.

119
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,740
Now that Yancheng is in charge of Fu Group, he calls the shots.

120
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,000
You aren't good enough for him.

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,919
He deserves better.

122
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,559
Yes, I know I'm not good enough for him.

123
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,679
It's good that you understand that.

124
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,400
You know what state the Sheng family is in.

125
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,240
The Fu family could help you once,

126
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,679
but don't expect us to do it again.

127
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,279
Your marriage into the family brought no benefits,

128
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,159
and we have to deal with your family's burdens.

129
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,399
Don't waste your concern on our Sheng family's affairs.

130
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,279
 Young Fu is back. 

131
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,160
Yancheng, you're back.

132
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,440
 I wonder what Fu Yancheng's reaction will be when he realizes  

133
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,210
 that the wife he's divorcing today is me. 

134
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,060


135
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,700
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

136
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:42,460
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

137
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:49,760
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

140
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:11,670

 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

141
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:19,250
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

142
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,160
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

143
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,940
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

144
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,740
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

145
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,590
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

146
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,320
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

147
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,190
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫
