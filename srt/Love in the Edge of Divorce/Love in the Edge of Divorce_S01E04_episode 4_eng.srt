00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:16,020


2
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,770
   

3
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,338
   

4
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,290
Why do you always.... always...

5
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,640
Why won't you just give me a chance?

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,940
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:13,550
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

8
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:19,120
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,410
Why?

10
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:27,880
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:35,470
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,430
You're the designer from Stellar Studio?

13
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,410
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

14
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,250
What did you think?

15
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,880
Who else can I be?

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,040
 How much did Lin Jing pay you for this job? 

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,610
 After tax, several millions. 

18
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,850
 Your project is big, time-consuming, 

19
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,640
 and I heard you have very high standards. 

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
 Most people can't meet them. 

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,470
 But don't worry, if you choose me, 

22
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,520
 my services will exceed your expectations. 

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,630
 Tell me what style you like. 

24
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,660
 I always adapt to my client's preferences. 

25
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,520
 I can also show you some of my past work. 

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
 How could that be my first time? 

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,500
 I've been working in this industry for three years. 

28
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,730
So, everything you said before was about interior design?

29
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,670
I just want to take on your project.

30
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,480
Fu Yancheng.

31
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,800
I admit...

32
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,560
I was quite lowly in front of you.

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,680
That's because I really wanted to get your project,

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,660
I... I still have my dignity.

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,310
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,520
I misunderstood you.

37
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,690
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

38
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,540
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

39
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,700
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

40
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,210
Qi Chen, bring me some woman's clothes. Be quick.

41
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,940
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

42
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:33,500
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫

43
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,570
   

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,370
President Fu.

45
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,440
You're awake.

46
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,790
That's all for today's meeting.

47
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,540
Dismissed.

48
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,120
I said, dismissed.

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,710
 - President Fu, goodbye. 
 - Goodbye. 

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,940
I'm sorry, President Fu. I didn't know you were in a meeting.

51
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,430
How are you feeling?

52
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,620
Does your head still hurt?

53
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,430
 What happened? He seems like a totally different person. 

54
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,870
I'm sorry, President Fu.

55
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,800
Even though I don't remember what happened last night,

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,510
I'm sure I caused you quite a lot of trouble.

57
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,360
I didn't mean to do that.

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
- You... 
 - I'll leave you to your work. I'll leave now.

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,460
Wait.

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,350
Didn't you want to find a working partner?

61
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,800
I can give you a chance to enter a bid.

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,160
Really?

63
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,340
The bidding conference for Royal View Gardens is in three days.

64
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,220
I can give you a chance to prove yourself.

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,600
You read my design proposal?

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,920
Your concept is excellent.

67
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,530
Thank you.

68
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,760
Thank you, President Fu.

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
How is it? Does this breakfast suit your taste?

70
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,880
It's good.

71
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,000
- Grandfather. 
  - You brat, you took over Fu Group, 

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,280
and now you show me no respect.

73
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,830
That's not true, Grandfather

74
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,900
 No? Then why are you trying to divorce Sheng Mian? 

75
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,310
 I may be meditating in the mountains, but I know everything. 

76
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,700
I'll be back tomorrow,

77
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,000
and then we're going to have a good talk.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,630
 Come with me to pick up Grandfather tomorrow. 

79
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,270
 If you don't want a fight, you'd better not mention that we're getting a divorce. 

80
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,210
 Okay, no problem. 

81
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,510
 I'll be there on time. 

82
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,050
President Fu, what's the matter?

83
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,070
You don't feel well?

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,490
It's nothing, just some troublesome issues and troublesome people.

85
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,120
 Fu Yancheng hates his wife so much, 

86
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,920
 I can't let him recognize that I am Penny, 

87
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,680
 or it will definitely ruin our cooperation. 

88
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,760
 I'll just show up today, and put on a show with him. 

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Hello?

90
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,160
Dad.

91
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,950
 Your sister is in the hospital again. Come quickly. 

92
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,900
I'll be there right away.

93
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,600
 Sorry, the number you have dialed cannot be connected at the moment. 

94
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,270
 Please... 

95
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,630
Grandfather, you look better after your retreat in the mountains.

96
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,730
Brat, you sure know how to make people happy.

97
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,000
Where's Sheng Mian?

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is she busy?

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,030
Who knows? Maybe she came down with acute appendicitis,

100
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,000
or met with an accident on her way.

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,870
You brat! What are you saying? Hey!

102
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,790
Seriously.

103
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,290
What kind of nonsense are you spewing?

104
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,960
You just came back in such good condition from your recuperation.

105
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,720
Let's not mention her, it's bad luck.

106
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,030
Mian Mian, I'm so happy you came today.

107
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,480
And you've even brought me a gift.

108
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,910
That's so nice of you, I like it very much.

109
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,670
I'm so happy you like it.

110
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,200
I was planning to pick you up with Yancheng that day,

111
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,910
but there was an urgent family matter that came up.

112
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,790
I'm so sorry.

113
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,000
Silly girl, you don't have to treat me as an outsider.

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm not a temperamental person.

115
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,830
It's such a pity Yancheng isn't home today.

116
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,060
Why do you always come when he isn't around?

117
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,960
Have you two been fighting?

118
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,390
No, Grandfather.

119
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,010
Grandfather, I think Fu...

120
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,630
Why is it that Yancheng

121
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,080
doesn't really smile much?

122
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,480
Yancheng has actually been through a lot.

123
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,000
As a child, his parents were always busy.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,080
So, he has always been alone.

125
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,000
He can be prideful and aloof,

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,910
but that's all the surface.

127
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,480
He doesn't know how to express his feelings.

128
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,110
But, actually, he's a warm person.

129
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,720
He values feelings very much!

130
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,790
So, I want you to give him a little time and get to know him.

131
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,790
I will do that, Grandfather.

132
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm quite old now, and I'm frail.

133
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
I wonder if the day will come when I can see my grandchildren.

134
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
Grandfather, you're strong and healthy.

135
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,750
You'll definitely meet your grandchildren.

136
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,250
Good!

137
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,270
I'm so happy to hear that.

138
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,280
Yancheng has always caused me to worry.

139
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,380
I still need to educate him.

140
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,200
You brat!

141
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,110
Mian Mian came to see me today.

142
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,510
She's such a good girl,

143
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,730
and she's looking forward to building a family with you.

144
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,010
You have to be good to her.

145
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,480
 Oh, no. 

146
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,640
 Fu Yancheng is going to be angry again. 

147
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,390
Qi Chen, take me to Grandfather's house.

148
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,120
But, President Fu, we have an appointment with President Zhang.

149
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,370
I'll see him later.

150
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,770
Okay.

151
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,550
Yancheng heard that you're here, so he's on his way over.

152
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,100
It seems like he loves you very much.

153
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,480
Grandfather, you should have a good rest.

154
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,750
I have something I need to do; I'll leave now.

155
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,840
Why the rush?

156
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,770
At least have dinner with us.

157
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,270
Grandfather, some urgent issues came up at work.

158
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,680
I'll visit you again.

159
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,240
All right then.

160
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,260
Goodbye, Grandfather.

161
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,560
Penny?

162
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,420
Fu... President Fu.

163
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:14,960


164
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,230
 "The Page You Appeared On" -

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,890
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

166
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:38,280
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

167
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:45,750
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

168
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,530
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

169
00:12:52,530 --> 00:13:00,230
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

170
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:07,910
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

171
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,700
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

172
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,390
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

173
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,290
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

174
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,900
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

175
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,920
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

176
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,730
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

177
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:39,170
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanginge was only half the story  ♫
