2
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,599
   

3
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,430
   

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,240
Why has so much money been funneled to this company?

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,840
Why did Dad never mention it to me?

6
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,200
Are you hiding something from me?

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,879
 Oh, no!. 

8
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,200
 Grandfather must have slipped and told Fu Yancheng. 

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,599
 What do I do now? 

10
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,399
Why did you lie to me?

11
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,200
You know everything?

12
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,599
Why did you do this?

13
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,839
Because I was afraid you wouldn't like me.

14
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,319
So, you used this method to test me?

15
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,500
That's not what I meant.

16
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,120
I just...

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,479
Do you know how happy I was at the hotel today when I heard Liang Hanqing say

18
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,159
you two were in a fake marriage?

19
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,080
 So, it's about that. 

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,759
This Liang Hanqing...

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,479
How dare he sell me out!

22
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,579
If I hadn't run into him today,

23
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,439
how long were you planning to hide this from me?

24
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,519
Until you got a divorce.

25
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,000
I didn't want to lie to you either.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,819
But I just felt like I wasn't so insignificant

27
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,439
if I said it this way.

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,700
I know you're concerned that I'm married. That's why you lied to me.

29
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,719
Grandfather has already promised me.

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,039
If I help Sheng Mian uncover the truth about her father's will,

31
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,920
he'll agree to my divorce.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
How do I know it's true?

33
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,639
What if you're lying to me?

34
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,879
Why don't I help you investigate?

35
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,879
I was worried that if you investigated the Sheng family with me you might not be happy.

36
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,960
I was just thinking about how to bring it up to you.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,019
How could I be so petty?

38
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,760
I want this matter resolved as much as anyone.

39
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,310
♫  It is a storm of memories  ♫ 
  ♫  I am still obsessed with it  ♫

40
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,880
♫  The ticket to enter your world was torn off by your own hands  ♫

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,400
♫  My hobby is to have you and be able to rely on you  ♫

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,060
Are you in such a hurry to marry me?

43
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,239
Who said I want to marry you?

44
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,520
♫  I don't know. I don't want to know. No need to know  ♫

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,040
♫  I am alone in the storm. After all, meetings cannot be replaced  ♫

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,010
♫  I can't forget you  ♫ 
  ♫  It's futile to worry about you  ♫

47
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,619
Are you sure we can find information here?

48
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,880
Let's take a chance.

49
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,780
Why are you standing there? Let's look together.

50
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,479
President Fu, don't act so aloof at this point.

51
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,600
Stop putting on that big boss persona.

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,619
It should be here.

53
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,279
Do you have any contracts with Sheng Group on your phone?

54
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,360
Yes.

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,939
Give it to me.

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,419
The password is Su Lan's birthday.

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,600
To take such a big risk with his career.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,839
He's really a love-struck fool.

59
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,120
This should be it.

60
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,080
 Lan Lan, what are you doing? 

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,880
Don't worry. I've already made arrangements with them.

62
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,700
Lan Lan, about that matter, I've almost completed it.

63
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,760
Don't worry, it's all taken care of.

64
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,600
The money will soon be transferred to your overseas account.

65
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,720
Okay.

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
Really?

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
You miss me?

68
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,360
How much do you miss me?

69
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,199
What do you miss?

70
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,839
What exactly do you miss?

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,879
I'll be back to accompany you soon.

72
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,399
 Lawyer Wang, Mr. Qi Chen is here to see you. 

73
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,519
Okay, coming.

74
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,179
I'll hang up now.

75
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,220
Did he leave?

76
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
Don't move.

77
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,480
Qi Chen is a little slow with words.

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,020
He probably won't be able to leave right away.

79
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,800
This is the information I've put together.

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,820
For some reason, this company has very close ties with Sheng Group.

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,800
All these contracts have problems.

82
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,060
This company is a shell company registered under Su Lan's brother's name.

83
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,480
Su Lan uses it to move money.

84
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,999
Sheng's funds were transferred this way.

85
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,519
It seems Lawyer Wang helped Su Lan with this.

86
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,920
In other words,

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,600
since Su Lan married into the Sheng family,

88
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,399
she's been embezzling from them.

89
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,160
No wonder the Sheng family has been through so many crises lately.

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,000
There have been internal issues all along.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,839
President Sheng was too trusting of Su Lan.

92
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,480
 I didn't expect that Su Lan had no feelings at all for my father. 

93
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,400
 She has always been scheming. 

94
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,199
Can we recover this money?

95
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,399
Right now, the prosecutor's office has followed the trail.

96
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,800
They've reached Lawyer Wang's law firm.

97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,040
With this evidence, if we act quickly and apply to the court,

98
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,759
we might be able to freeze their assets

99
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,759
and recover some of it.

100
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,639
What's the matter?

101
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,800
What does this have to do with you?

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,279
Why are you so concerned?

103
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm not.

104
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,719
I just think Su Lan and Lawyer Wang are so detestable.

105
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,000
If it weren't for them,

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,519
maybe Sheng Mian wouldn't have had to marry you.

107
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,920
That's true.

108
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,079
They're so bold,

109
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,480
even using the company's funds to pay for hotel rooms.

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,240
Five times a week.

111
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,920
Lawyer Wang and Su Lan are really something, aren't they?

112
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,000
Doing this at their age.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,860
From the tone of your voice, your quite envious.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,040
If you want, I can arrange it for you.

115
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,279
Move again, and I wouldn't mind letting you feel

116
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,160
how much I envy them.

117
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,160
Hello?

118
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,279
Okay, I understand.

119
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,920
Lawyer Wang has run away.

120
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,040
 Lan Lan, how long do you want me to hide? 

121
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,079
 I can't even go home. 

122
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,279
Don't worry. The procedures are already in progress.

123
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,510
 Just wait. 

124
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,390
The supervision committee has already traced me.

125
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,859
If they catch me, I'll spend the rest of my life in jail.

126
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,799
 Everything I did was for you. 

127
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,480
 - You promised me.  
 - All right, enough.

128
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,360
I know you've suffered for me.

129
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,500
Once the money is transferred, we'll go abroad together.

130
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,879
You aren't lying to me, are you?

131
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,399
You know me. My heart is only for you.

132
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,879
 After all these years, I haven't been with any other man. Right? 

133
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,080
That's really shameless of you to say that.

134
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,720
Let's separate the issues.

135
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,480
Once everything is done, don't forget that money.

136
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,799
Don't worry, I'm also yours.

137
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,460
What are you afraid of?

138
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,640
Who is it?

139
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,920
Who's there?

140
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,240
Don't come any closer.

141
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,399
Don't come closer.

142
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,120
If you come any closer,

143
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll kill myself right here.

144
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,840
If I die, you'll never get those billions back.

145
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Seems like you know your own value.

146
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,960
Su Lan was right,

147
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,279
the eldest daughter of the Sheng family is quite capable.

148
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,240
You can get President Fu to deal with a small fry like me.

149
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,960
After all this, you're still thinking about Su Lan?

150
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,759
She's the one who pushed you to this point.

151
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,479
Don't try to drive a wedge between us.

152
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,840
Su Lan leaked your whereabouts.

153
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,080
You've always been her scapegoat.

154
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,279
This is the information Su Lan gave to the supervisory committee.

155
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,199
Take a good look.

156
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,319
 Hello, the number you dialed is no longer in service. 

157
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,460
Su Lan is not like that.

158
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,200
It must be you!

159
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,899
You must have plotted together to deceive me, to set me up. Right?

160
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,439
I've slogged for the Sheng family all these years, and what did I get?

161
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,840
Sheng Zhong, he stole someone else's lover!

162
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,960
In the end, even Su Lan deceived me.

163
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,039
Lawyer Wang,

164
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,480
how about working with us?

165
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,719
This way, we have a chance to get back at Su Lan.

 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

168
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,980
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

169
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:38,330
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

170
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:46,030
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

171
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:52,640
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

172
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:00,200
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

173
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,920
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

174
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,710
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

175
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,470
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

176
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,420
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

177
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,170
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

178
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,000
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,760
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

180
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:39,610
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
