1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:16,020


2
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,800
   

3
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,235
   

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,840
Lawyer Wang,

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,319
how about working with us?

6
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,459
This way, we have a chance to get back at Su Lan.

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,400
Compared to Su Lan,

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,200
I hate the Sheng family even more.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,419
 Seems like he's mistaken Penny for Sheng Mian. 

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,319
Lawyer Wang, you don't think holding a woman hostage is enough to threaten me, do you?

11
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,539
Didn't Su Lan tell you? I don't care about her at all.

12
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,300
I only brought this woman here to get back the money I've invested.

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,000
As for you, instead of implicating others,

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,639
you should think more about how to save yourself.

15
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,000
Penny, are you all right?

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,100
How are you feeling?

17
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,319
 So, their relationship is still so stable. 

18
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,539
 In that case, Sheng Mian cannot keep that child. 

19
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:39,379
Penny, your top priority now is to take care of yourself and the baby.

20
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,719
As for the rest, do you trust me to handle it?

21
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,520
But you were too impulsive today.

22
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,540
No wonder Lawyer Wang mistook you for Sheng Mian.

23
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,539
Fortunately, Lawyer Wang hasn't met Sheng Mian before.

24
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,240
Regardless, this had nothing to do with you.

25
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,360
I dragged you into this.

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,400
If something really happened to you, what was I supposed to do?

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,960
 I admit I overreacted today. 

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,940
 Fortunately, Fu Yancheng doesnt suspect anything. 

29
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,560
I just want you to divorce Sheng Mian as soon as possible.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,460
I won't act that way again.

31
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,000
I've already sent someone to keep watch over Lawyer Wang at the hospital.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,879
Fortunately, it was a scare that turned out okay.

33
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
You should go rest now.

34
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,200
I'll go rest then.

35
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,460
Send me a picture of Su Lan's brother.

36
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,539
I remember that the Sheng family once invited him to their banquet,

37
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:49,879
so he should have been there.

38
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,439
Take another look to see if there are any group photos.

39
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,479
 Oh no! 

40
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,980
 I hope I'm not in those group photos. 

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,639
Okay, I understand.

42
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,160
I want to have a bite, too.

43
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:25,290
♫  I shouldn't care  ♫ 
 ♫  After all, there are too many beautiful memories  ♫

44
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:33,100
♫  The world is upside down  ♫ 
 ♫  There is nothing worse than now  ♫

45
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,820
♫  Blame me. It's not your necessity  ♫

46
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:47,820
♫  I can't control our huge distance well  ♫ 
 ♫  My thoughts have left me nowhere to run  ♫

47
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,660
You can enjoy yourself tonight.

48
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,680
♫  I regard you as higher than the sky; no one can replace you  ♫ 
 ♫  Is it a little ridiculous?  ♫

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,220
♫  The hug I once coveted  ♫ 
 ♫  I never had it for a second  ♫

50
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,319
 Fortunately, I'm not in those photos. 

51
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,800
 Otherwise, I'd have to get Grandfather to shut Qi Chen up. 

52
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,319
What? The shoes have been reserved by someone else?

53
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,879
Didn't we agree that you'd contact me when they arrived?

54
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,560
 I'm so sorry, Miss Xiao. 

55
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,160
 Those shoes were reserved by President Fu from our group a few days ago, 

56
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,959
 and they have already been engraved with the other party's name. 

57
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,000
 President Fu specifically instructed that they must be delivered before his friend attends an event tomorrow. 

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,079
 - I'm so sorry.  
 - Whose name is on them?

59
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,439
 Let me check. 

60
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,480
 It's 'Penny'. 

61
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,519
 Miss Xiao, would you like to come to the store and take a look at other designs? 

62
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,020
No!

63
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,799
That wretched Penny!

64
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,859
Always trying to compete with me for everything.

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,720
- Xiao Chuqing, what a coincidence! 
 - It's you?

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,560
Go back and tell your sister not to steal the things I like.

67
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,639
Whether it's a man or items, I will take them back one by one.

68
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,260
How can you call it "stealing" if you haven't obtained those things yet?

69
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,860
You haven't obtained them yet, which only proves your incompetence.

70
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,199
Don't get too cocky yet.

71
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,120
Your sister is using Penny's identity to trick Yancheng.

72
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,519
Let's see how things will come out in the end.

73
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,120
Remember this, Xiao Chuqing.

74
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,199
My sister is pregnant.

75
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,759
I just accompanied her for her prenatal checkup.

76
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,199
The doctor said it's very likely to be a boy.

77
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,120
With the eldest grandson of the Fu family,

78
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,120
no one can shake my sister's position in the Fu family anymore.

79
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,759
You'd better make peace with my sister soon.

80
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,559
Tomorrow's the Sheng family's annual gathering.

81
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,399
If you can come and apologize to my sister,

82
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,760
I can consider persuading her to forgive you.

83
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,240
 Xiao Chuqing, you'd better seize this opportunity well. 

84
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,159
 So, Penny is going to attend the Sheng family's annual gathering tomorrow. 

85
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,379
 It's still uncertain whether the eldest grandson of the Fu family will be able to survive. 

86
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,560
The will was indeed fake!

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,439
The matter of Su Lan illegally transferring the Sheng family's assets

88
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,000
and creating a fake will has finally been clarified.

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,399
President Sheng literally invited trouble into his own home.

90
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,139
Now that that is all of the Sheng family's issues, shouldn't we discuss ours next?

91
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
Penny.

92
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,800
I don't care about the grievances within the Sheng family.

93
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,200
I only know that once this matter is cleared up, I will be free again.

94
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,959
Open it.

95
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,860
This is a gift for you.

96
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,360
You mentioned before that you have an important event tomorrow.

97
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,460
You can wear these.

98
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,800
Your feet are a bit swollen because you're pregnant.

99
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,059
So, I bought you a size larger.

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,319
Thank you.

101
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,439
They're very pretty.

102
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,439
I've heard that giving shoes to a lover can lead to a breakup soon.

103
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,959
I don't care what other people say.

104
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm giving you these shoes because I want to spend a lifetime with you.

111

Do you still remember the last ball where you wore a veil and danced with me?

112
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,840
I remember.

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,899
At that moment, it felt like we were already married,

114
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,499
but there was a veil separating us.

115
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,800

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,519
I thought you weren't going to come.

120
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,619
This is the first annual gathering of the Shengs since Dad passed away.

121
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,840
How could I miss it?

122
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,999
Sis, I know you're upset about the division of the inheritance.

123
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:53,120
Although Sheng Group is mine now, we're still sisters, aren't we?

124
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,740
Can we go back to being like we were before?

125
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,320
If Dad really wanted to give the company to you,

126
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,759
Of course, I wouldn't be unhappy about it.

127
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,220
Let's go inside, Sis.
