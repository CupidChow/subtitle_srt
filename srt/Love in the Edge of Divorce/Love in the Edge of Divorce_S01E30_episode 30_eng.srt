1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,020


2
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,527
   

3
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:48,400
   

4
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,840
 She's lost a lot of blood. 

5
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,950
 Without a quick blood transfusion, even she won't survive. 

6
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,120
 Doctor, the patient is waking up. 

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,840
 You're in a very critical condition. 

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,790
 There's no family outside to sign for you. 

9
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,540
 If you can, put your hand print on this permission for surgery. 

10
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,000
 We'll treat this as a special case. 

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,570
 Doctor. Please. Please save my child. 

12
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,590
 Don't worry, we'll do our best. 

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,610
 The baby was saved. Don't worry. 

14
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,510
 I'll inform your family. 

15
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,370
 Doctor. 

16
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,180
 Please keep this a secret. 

17
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,990
 My baby. Mama is ready to forgive Dad. 

18
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,760
 When Dad's injury has healed, 

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,900
 Mama is going to tell him about you. 

20
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,970
 He'll be so happy. 

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,460
What are you thinking about?

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,760
Nothing.

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm going to work.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,290
President Fu, you were looking for me?

25
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,550
I only wanted to see you today for one thing.

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,240
Sign this.

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,950
   

28
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,700
Why should I sign this?

29
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,460
Because you almost killed Sheng Mian the other day.

30
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,600
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

31
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,750
You're still pretending?

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,770
The maintenance of Sheng Group's exterior wall is at the beginning of the month.

33
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,960
Yesterday, I heard that the second daughter, Miss Sheng,

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,030
urged the property managers to find workers for repairs.

35
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,750
And then the tool bag fell.

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,340
What a coincidence! Don't you think so?

37
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,390
Now, this worker is outside.

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,650
If you displease me today,

39
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,430
he's going to come in here and reveal your secret.

40
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,750
President Fu.

41
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,390
Brother-in-law. Please give me another chance.

42
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,030
I was thinking only of myself.

43
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,890
I'm jealous of my sister. But I was just trying to scare her.

44
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,680
I didn't think I'd hurt you.

45
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,160
President Fu, I won't do it again. I can't go to jail.

46
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,520
Please give me another chance.

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,150
She's still my sister.

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,680
You just have to sign this contract, and I'll promise you this.

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,920
This matter will not be mentioned again.

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,460
But that's all I have left. Don't you think there's something else...

51
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,000
Sheng Weiyuan.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,920
From the moment you thought of harming her,

53
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,630
you must have known the consequences.

54
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,000
Sign this.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,380
I'm giving you one chance.

56
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,170
Go to jail, or transfer all the shares to Sheng Mian.

57
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,920
Make your choice.

58
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,450
   

59
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
This is the business report for the last quarter.

60
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,270
You should take a look.

61
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,650
I have some new adjustment ideas for Sheng Group's business.

62
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,460
What's wrong?

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,530
You... can't be pregnant, can you?

64
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Fu Yancheng doesn't know?

65
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,620
He knew I was pregnant.

66
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,630
But then something happened.

67
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,630
He thought we lost the baby.

68
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,070
This is such an important thing.

69
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,840
Why haven't you told him?

70
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,120
So much has happened between us before.

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,150
Also, there are always people who want to harm the baby.

72
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,560
I want to protect the baby.

73
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,780
So, no one knows about my child.

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,240
Actually, I'm planning to tell him tonight.

75
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,920
It looks like I have no chance.

76
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,760
Wen Zhao. Actually, I...

77
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,530
Stop, don't try to make it sound good.

78
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,920
I know that Fu Yancheng is a good man.

79
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,580
In fact, I've known this all along.

80
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,390
I've lost to him.

81
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,460
I don't think I could do what he did for you.

82
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,040
And it's clear that you love him.

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,190
- Wen Zhao. 
 - What?

84
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,580
I'm enjoying my bachelor life right now.

85
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,120
Don't forget. I'm the most eligible man in the world.

86
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,040
I'm very popular now.

87
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,410
Also, who could love only one woman forever like Fu Yancheng?

88
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,490
Sheng Mian.

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,190
You must be happy.

90
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,600
You, too.

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,950
Where are you going after work? Do you want me to drive you?

92
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,960
No, thanks.

93
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,190
I'm going to find Yancheng and surprise him.

94
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,960
I understand; I won't be a third wheel.

95
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,600
Sheng Mian, what's wrong?

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,720
My stomach hurts.

97
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,630
Let's get you to the hospital.

98
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,650
Doctor, how's my baby?

99
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,920
The current situation is not very optimistic.

100
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,390
The baby's heart is unstable.

101
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,750
I advise you to have an abortion quickly.

102
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,070
If not, as the baby grows, it will hurt you more.

103
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,490
Doctor, is there really no hope at all?

104
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,270
Based on the results,

105
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,320
the chances of saving the baby are extremely low.

106
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Unless there is obvious fetal movement again.

107
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,190
I'll think about it.

108
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,630
Are you okay?

109
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,760
The doctor said the baby might not survive.

110
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,920
Do you want to tell Fu Yancheng?

111
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,200
My mind is all messed up right now.

112
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,290
I'll help you get some rest.

113
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,980
Sheng Mian.

114
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,550
Doctor, I am a family member of Sheng Mian.

115
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,000
What's wrong with her?

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This is the consent form for her abortion.

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,070
If she makes the decision today, she can schedule the surgery.

118
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
 A baby. 

119
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,920
 Our baby is still alive. 

120
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
 Sheng Mian's going to abort the baby. 

121
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,150
Hello, Yancheng.

122
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,150
 Where are you? 

123
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,970
I'm... I'm at the company.

124
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,620
I'll meet you after work.

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,950
Why are you lying to me?

126
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,240
I'll tell you when we get home.

127
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,790
Sheng Mian, I have something to do, so I'm leaving.

128
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,870
You came to the hospital without telling me.

129
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,280
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

130
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,230
It's nothing.

131
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,910
I've just been working too hard lately.

132
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,770
My body is a little weak.

133
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,390
I came to the hospital to get some medicine.

134
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,290
Get some medicine... What kind of medicine?

135
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,220
Abortion pills?

136
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:05,000


137
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,780
