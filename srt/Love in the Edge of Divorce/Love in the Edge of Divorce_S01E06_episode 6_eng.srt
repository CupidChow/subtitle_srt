1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:15,970


2
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,630
   

3
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,308
   

4
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,640
I've personally confirmed the specific terms of the contract.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,539
If it's okay, let's sign it.

6
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,460
   

7
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,280
 You're Sheng Mian? 

8
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,860
 I... 

9
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,359
 So you're Sheng Mian. 

10
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,740
 With a dowry of 300 million, you married into the Fu Family. 

11
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,239
 Now I'm getting a divorce. 

12
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,519
 You desperately reached out to me as a designer. 

13
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,799
 Exactly what is your purpose? 

14
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,760
 You fooled me like that. 

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,819
 Can you afford the price? 

16
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,359
President Fu, something urgent has come up.

17
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,680
I have to leave.

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Wait.

19
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,380
I just want you to sign it before you leave.

20
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,240
 What should I do? 

21
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,079
 Why are you ears so red? 

22
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,619
 You're a bit close to me. 

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,699
 I guess I have to try this. 

24
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,600
President Fu, look...

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,339
Is it okay to sign it this way?

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,779
President Fu?

27
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,680
President Fu,

28
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,820
I hope we can cooperate happily.

29
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,579
I have to go.

30
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,319
President Fu.

31
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,039
You seem bedazzled.

32
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,339
Well, is there something between you and Miss Penny?

33
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:11,379
Don't you have work to do?

34
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,039
Well, I'm just verbalizing your thoughts.

35
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,240
I've been busy seeking information about Miss Penny.

36
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,159
If that's the case, then I won't say anything.

37
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,660
Come back.

38
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,540
Say it.

39
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,639
Miss Penny's birthday is two weeks away.

40
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,239
Shouldn't you prepare gifts in advance and put up a good show?

41
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,700
Why would I ever give her a present?

42
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,919
Thank you for helping me pick out a present today.

43
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,999
I can tell that you really care about this female friend.

44
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm curious about why she is so special.

45
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
She's a designer.

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,240
Very talented yet very low-key.

47
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,800
She's strong but also can be vulnerable.

48
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,160
She's kind but always keeps her distance.

49
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,519
I can't help but want to know more about her.

50
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,720
Then what does she like?

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,519
Whatever you like will surely please her.

52
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,299
I've been eyeing this Sunshine necklace for such a long time.

53
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,920
It isn't on the market.

54
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,699
I didn't expect to see it here.

55
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,419
I'll take this then.

56
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,340
Try it on for me, please.

57
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:55,530
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

58
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:03,180
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

59
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,070
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

60
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,770
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

61
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,610
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

62
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,370
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

63
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,270
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

64
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,030
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

65
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:34,340
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫

66
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,499
It really suits you.

67
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,839
 Yancheng, I'm back. 

68
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,560
Chuqing. 
    

69
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,040
Long time no see.

70
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,580
I came to see you as soon as I got back. Surprised?

71
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,039
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I could've sent Qi Chen to pick you up.

72
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,699
This is?

73
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,800
Hello, I'm Penny, the designer for President Fu's villa.

74
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,739
Xiao Chuqing.

75
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:28,040
Yancheng, have you forgotten I'm a designer, too.

76
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,559
You didn't tell me about the renovations.

77
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,680
You're so busy. How can I bother you?

78
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,320
Besides I like Penny's design style very much.

79
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,560
Then I should learn from Miss Penny.

80
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,680
You flatter me, Miss Xiao.

81
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,519
By the way, Yancheng,

82
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,160
I want a welcome banquet today.

83
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,680
I can hold it at your place, right?

84
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,160
Sure.

85
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,299
Please join us, Miss Penny.

86
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,380
Thanks for inviting me, but I won't come.

87
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,360
We have many friends who need to decorate their home.

88
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,519
Come and meet them.

89
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,000
Come.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,859
I also want to introduce you to more people.

91
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,299
Okay.

92
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:06,360
It's better to accept deferentially than to decline courteously.

93
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:19,639
Chuqing, three years ago, when Fu Yan cheng got married,

94
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,759
you went abroad angrily and since then, you've refused to see him.

95
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you back because you've moved on

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,160
or because he's getting a divorce from that woman from a humble family?

97
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,360
Miss Xiao.

98
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,340
Penny, I'm glad you could come.

99
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,580
Penny.

100
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,399
That dress suits you very well.

101
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,180
Thank you, President Fu.

102
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,520
Yancheng, my mom is here.

103
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,959
 Oh no. I can't let her see me! 

104
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:15,600
- Yancheng. 
 - Madam Bai, long time no see.

105
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Do you mind if we have a word?

106
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
This way, please.

107
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,320
Okay.

108
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:31,859
I'm sorry, President Fu. I felt a little dizzy just now.

109
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,159
Chuqing, I'm sorry.

110
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,440
It's okay.

111
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,360
- I'm sorry about the stain on your dress. 
 - It's okay.

112
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,460
You were invited by Yan Cheng. I can't be the killjoy.

113
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,039
Let me take you to deal with it.

114
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,780
- Don't bother. 
 - It's okay, let's go.

115
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,060
This is a dress my friend just gave me. I haven't worn it yet.

116
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,720
We're about the same size. Why don't you wear it.

117
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,240
It's fine. I'll just dry my dress.

118
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,480
Yancheng's friend is my friend, too.

119
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,200
You don't have to be so polite.

120
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,759
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye out for you.

121
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,479
Just go ahead.

122
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Penny, though we just met each other,

123
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,120
you seem quite easy on the eyes.

124
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,899
There's something I want to ask for your advice about.

125
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,139
I don't know if you mind.

126
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,240
Thank you for trusting me.

127
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,200
Just tell me about it.

128
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,600
Three years ago, I did go abroad because of Yancheng.

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,840
That was because he broke his promise.

130
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,740
Though he said he was forced to do so, I still didn't forgive him.

131
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,600
But some time ago, he said he was getting a divorce

132
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,399
and asked me to give him a second chance.

133
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,080
Penny, do you think I should give him another chance?

134
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,159
Since you have this question,

135
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,320
I guess when you asked me, you already had an answer.

136
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,879
So, you don't have to ask my opinion.

137
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,120
Secondly... I'm just a business partner with President Fu.

138
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,299
It isn't appropriate to pry into his personal matters.

139
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,459
Please forgive me.

140
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,799
No wonder Yancheng appreciates you, Penny.

141
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,919
You're very diplomatic.

142
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,439
Are you done changing? Let me help you with the zipper.

143
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,280
Thanks.

144
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,559
Thanks.

145
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,599
Sunlight?

146
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,800
 The necklace I'm going to wear can't be worn by someone else. 

147
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,420
You know about Sunlight, too?

148
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,919
My best friend gave it to me.

149
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,719
Isn't it pretty?

150
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,979
So beautiful.

151
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,220
 I guess Fu Yancheng likes Xiao Chuqing. 

152
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,559
 It has always been her. 

153
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,279
 What am I daydreaming about? 

154
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,300
 How ridiculous. 

155
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,279
Chuqing, it's time to cut the cake.

156
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,220
Penny, please hold my bag for me.

157
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,440
Yancheng, I'm about to cut the cake.

158
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,280
But I don't know where Xiao Yang is.

159
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,459
Can you help me out and cut it with me?

160
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,400
Come on.

161
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,639
Let's welcome today's heroine, Chuqing.

162
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,540
Now, she'll cut the cake.

163
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,599
Thanks, everyone.

164
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,280
All of you today are those closest to me.

165
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,480
Surrounded by your love makes me feel so happy.

166
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,060
I want to use the camera to capture this precious moment.

167
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,900
Penny, could you bring me the camera from my bag, please?

168
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:24,820

 ''The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

170
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:40,610
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

171
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:47,910
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

172
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:55,530
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

173
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:02,260
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

174
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,810
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

175
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:17,520
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

176
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,370
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

177
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,050
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

178
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,930
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

179
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,680
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

180
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,590
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

181
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,440
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

182
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:48,850
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
