1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,010


2
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,513
   

3
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,510
   

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,780
Penny?

5
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,100
Fu... President  Fu.

6
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,840
Why are you here?

7
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,120
The bidding meeting is about to start, isn't it?

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,359
I'd like to talk to you about the bid.

9
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,699
That can be discussed at my company, right?

10
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,940
Do you know what this place is?

11
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,400
I just want to have a deeper understanding

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,280
of your home's decor style and your preferences

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,579
to better prepare for the bid.

14
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:25,399
If you want to study my home's decor style and my preferences,

15
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,159
you can just ask me, can't you?

16
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,520
Why are you at my grandfather's house?

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,220
 Yancheng, are you back? 

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,279
 Yancheng, is that you? 

19
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,860
 What? 

20
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,360
 That's strange. 

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,819
I was sure Yan cheng had come back.

22
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,699
President Fu,

23
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,180
why are your ears so red?

24
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,880
You're a bit too close to me.

25
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,419
It's too hot.

26
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm sorry, President Fu.

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,419
I suddenly felt a little dizzy.

28
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm so sorry, President Fu.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,580
Because of the plan, I rashly came to your house today.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,319
It's okay.

31
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,400
If you want to know about my preferences,

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,680
you can just ask me.

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,400
Okay.

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,039
Then, President Fu, I'll be going.

35
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,779
See you at the meeting tomorrow.

36
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,299
Okay.

37
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,280
President Fu.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,639
What are you staring at?

39
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,220
Nothing.

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,280
Qi Chen, if a girl suddenly drops by your home

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
and acts intimately, what does that mean?

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,919
She definitely likes you.

43
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,919
Likes me?

44
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,100
Looks like another woman has succumbed to your charm, President Fu.

45
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,759
You talk too much.

46
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,839
It was you who asked me.

47
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,918
   

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,599
Hello, everyone.

49
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm Penny, a designer at Stellar Studio.

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,919
Now, let me introduce my design proposal.

51
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,560
You're just a copycat.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,519
What right do you have to stand there?

53
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,800
It's no wonder a designer of a little studio

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,079
can win a chance to bid under President Fu.

55
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,600
It turns out you copied others.

56
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
I didn't copy anything.

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,759
That's just your side of the story.

58
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,479
Who would believe you?

59
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,760
I don't think President Fu would believe it either.

60
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,320
I hope you can explain why your design

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
looks exactly the same as ours?

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,160
 - They really are the same. 
 - Yes. 

63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,759
 There surely must be a problem. 

64
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,280
 - Right. 
 - She's a copycat.  

65
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,639
 Who knows? 

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,120
Director Xiao, since you claim that this is your work,

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,660
may I ask what inspired your design?

68
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,639
It was designed by our designers.

69
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,879
I certainly know the inspiration.

70
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,519
As we can see, it's striking features are in the style of classic Chinese gardens.

71
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,615
It's inspired by Suzhou Gardens.

72
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,639
We'll turn this villa into a place of nature and simplicity.

73
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,319
Seems like you only noticed the general style

74
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,600
and missed many details.

75
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,360
If carefully observed,

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,120
the courtyard and interior decorations, such as the walls and stairs,

77
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,199
embody the symbol of maple leaves.

78
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,319
This is based on President Fu's preferences which I inferred from his watch strap and his ties.

79
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,540
 - Let me wipe that.  
  - Stop. 

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,920
 Does she really... 

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,679
You can also see that the courtyard floor

82
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,199
is mostly made of glass.

83
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,319
Director Xiao, let me ask if you know why I picked this material.

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,959
Of course.

85
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,040
The courtyard seems more dynamic this way.

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,820
The artificial warm light, slanted at 35 degrees,

87
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,700
simulates the effect of a sunset in the courtyard.

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,400
As for the walls, I specially chose granite containing natural crystals,

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,760
which can reflect a more dazzling shine.

90
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,439
But in Director Xiao's design, there's no granite, nor maple leaves.

91
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,200
Isn't that right?

92
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,519
Don't try to fool me with cheap tricks.

93
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,480
Well, you said it's your work,

94
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,300
then where's your draft design?

95
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,560
It was in my computer.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,579
But it was...

97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,020
was just drenched in water.

98
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,500
 What's wrong with you? 

99
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,920
 So, it was Xiao Yang who had someone do that. 

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,399
What a poor excuse!

101
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,680
Here is the draft from our company.

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,039
It clearly shows when the design was finished.

103
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,680
A copycat who can't show the draft

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,759
is not a designer at all.

105
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,720
If people like her stay in the design industry,

106
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,599
it would be a great shame to all of us.

107
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,140
After this, your career is over.

108
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,739
President Fu.

109
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,820
I've seen Miss Penny's draft.

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,260
Here it is.

111
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,839
As for Director Xiao's draft,

112
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,120
let the professionals assess it.

113
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,480
Whether it's authentic or not, it's up to them.

114
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,080
I forgot to tell you that I have a little habit

115
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,900
of putting my name into my design.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Look. My design has "Penny" in English.

117
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,919
I guess...

118
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,519
Director Xiao's design should also have my name.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,759
I did copy it. So what?

120
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,199
You're just an unknown designer.

121
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,799
Why should you cooperate with Fu Yancheng?

122
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,259
You're just trying to seduce him!

123
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,239
How dare you hit me!

124
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,679
Fu Yancheng!

125
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,899
How can you disregard the friendship between our families

126
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,440
to protect wholeheartedly this loose woman?

127
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,740
Xiao Yang, who said you could use my full name?

128
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,200
I won't talk about friendship

129
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,879
with someone who copied and slandered others.

130
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,320
From today forward,

131
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,359
Fu Group will stop all cooperation with the Xiao family.

132
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,140
For today's bidding meeting, the winner is Stellar Studio.

133
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Sis, if you don't come back,

134
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,639
you will lose Fu Yancheng to other women!

135
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,960
So that's the way it is.

136
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,519
You fool around all day.

137
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,579
What's the point of bullying a little designer?

138
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:39,799
Show some real stuff so you can compete.

139
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,560
 Don't embarrass our family. 

140
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,919
Sister, I was just taking advantage of this chance to end Penny's career.

141
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,080
 I didn't think he'd step in and ruin everything. 

142
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,839
 Sister, you graduated from a top university abroad, 

143
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,480
 learned from a famous designer, 

144
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,399
and you and Fu Yancheng are childhood sweethearts.

145
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,479
Can you just sit and watch some other woman steal him away?

146
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,079
Competing for a man was never my thing.

147
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,160
It's always men competing for me.

148
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,960
But I should head back to see what's going on.

149
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,180
 That's so like you, Sis. 

150
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
Penny,

151
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,919
this time, we snagged the project for Fu Yancheng's villa.

152
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,759
You're the biggest contributor.

153
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,080
Once the funds are set,

154
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,600
our financial problem will be solved.

155
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,360
Great!

156
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,440
And President Fu wants you to personally sign the contract.

157
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,720
I've said yes for you.

158
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,360
 If Fu Yancheng finds out I'm Sheng Mian, 

159
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,345
 he'll think that I reached out on purpose 

160
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:46,039
 and he'll surely stop the cooperation. 

161
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,320
What's wrong? Why do you look unhappy?

162
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,040
It's not convenient for me to sign.

163
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,639
You can sign it.

164
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,039
No! It has to be you.

165
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,919
Or it will be a void contract.

166
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,320
- But I... 
 - There's no need to worry.

167
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,919
President Fu has designated you to be the designer.

168
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,320
How lovely that is!

169
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm going to prepare.

170
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,919
Penny will be here in a moment, right?

171
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,679
Yes, you have an appointment today to sign the contract with her.

172
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,039
President Fu, you can just send the contract to her.

173
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,720
But you asked Penny to come here and sign it in person.

174
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,559
I think you want to find an excuse to meet Penny.

175
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:32,079
I see that, recently, you have had quite a lot of free time, Qi Chen.

176
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,040
President Fu, I think I have some work to do.

177
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,400
President Fu, I'm here to sign the contract.

178
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,240
I have personally confirmed the specific terms of the contract.

179
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,920
If it's okay, let's sign it.

180
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:41,738
   

181
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,000
You're Sheng Mian?

182
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,320
I...

183
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,140


184
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,320
 "The Page You Appeared On" 

185
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:23,130
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

186
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:30,560
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

187
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:38,100
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

188
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,770
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

189
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:52,310
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

190
00:14:52,310 --> 00:15:00,120
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

191
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,850
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

192
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,650
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

193
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,450
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

194
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,280
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

195
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,020
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

196
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,910
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

197
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:30,980
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
