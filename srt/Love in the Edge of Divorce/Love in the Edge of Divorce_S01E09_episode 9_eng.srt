00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,020
President Fu, I...

00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,800
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

♫  The only dream I dream is always you  ♫

16
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,180
The doctor said you're recovering well and you should be fully healed in a few days.

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,599
I've had to trouble you again to make my medicine.

18
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,480
President Fu, thank you for caring for me over these last few days.

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,820
I've already said this, it's my responsibility to take care of you

20
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,519
Drink it.

21
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,259
So bitter.

22
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,039
Is it still bitter?

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,080
No.

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,800
It isn't bitter now.

25
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,919
Miss Penny, you don't have to hurry off.

26
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,919
President Fu just left on a business trip today, and you want to leave as well.

27
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,460
How am I supposed to explain this to him when he comes back?

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,279
If that's the case, President Fu will definitely send me to Africa.

29
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,799
I've already bothered President Fu enough.

30
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,279
Besides, my hand is almost healed.

31
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:33,360
Don't worry, I'll explain this to him when he returns.

32
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,160
- Grandfather. 
  - Mian Mian, 

33
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,220
 I haven't seen you in a long time. 

34
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,240
How about coming and staying over tonight; talk with me?

35
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,080
 I'm old and not useful anymore. 

36
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,800
Nobody pays attention to this old man anymore.

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,279
Mian Mian, you won't ignore me. Right?

38
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,720
What are you saying, Grandfather?

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,820
You have my word. I'll come there tonight.

40
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,940
 Great, I'll be waiting for you. 

41
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,919
 Fu Yancheng left on a business trip today, 

42
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,439
 so he definitely won't be home. 

43
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,920
 It'll be fine. 

44
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,600
Grandfather.

45
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,680
Grandfather.

46
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
Yancheng, come on in.

47
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,519
- Grandfather. 
  - Oh no. 

48
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,580
 It's Fu Yancheng. 

49
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,120
Mian Mian?

50
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,759
What's happened to you?

51
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,600
Grandfather,

52
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,040
I... I have an allergic reaction on my face.

53
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm not presentable now.

54
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,239
I'll go back to my room

55
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,759
Hold on!

56
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,279
Yancheng.

57
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,999
Since Mian Mian said she's sick,

58
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,439
just let her go back and rest.

59
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,879
Grandfather, is this what you wanted to discuss?

60
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,039
Did you upset Mian Mian again?

61
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,519
Goodness. You're something.

62
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,900
It's fine, let's talk about it tomorrow.

63
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,480
Come and have a couple of drinks with me.

64
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,960
Okay.

65
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,410
Let's go.

66
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,879
 As long as I stay quietly in my room, 

67
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,879
 I won't bump into Fu Yancheng. 

68
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,439
 Mian Mian! 

69
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,800
 Yancheng is drunk! 

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,120
 Come help take care of him! 

71
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,499
 Oh no! How did he get into my room? 

72
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,659
 I'm really going to get caught. 

73
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,239
Penny.

74
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,700
Let me explain.

75
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,260
 You only have a crush on me as Penny. 

76
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,560
 If you knew I was Sheng Mian, 

77
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:22,160
 would you think I've been lying to you and hate me? 

78
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:42,600
Sheng Mian, why are you here?

79
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,919
- Auntie, yesterday, I... 
 - Shut up

80
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,100
You've schemed to get close to Yancheng,

81
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,340
and even chased him here while agreeing to the divorce.

82
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,799
Shameless!

83
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,000
Listen! Forget it!

84
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,119
As long as I'm alive, I won't allow you to stay in the Fu family.

85
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,240
What happened, Mom?

86
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,080
Sheng Mian? Stop!

87
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,859
Yancheng, stop chasing her.

88
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:11,139
This woman obviously plotted against you with your grandfather.

89
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,799
And when the plan failed, she ran away.

90
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,919
Isn't that a sign of guilt?

91
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,599
I want to see who this woman really is.

92
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,840


93
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,850
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

94
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:10,530
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

95
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:18,020
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

96
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:25,570
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

97
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,260
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

98
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:39,820
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

99
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:47,540
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

100
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,290
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

101
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,990
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

102
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,890
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

103
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,710
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

104
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,520
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

105
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,320
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

106
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,240
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
