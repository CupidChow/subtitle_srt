1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:16,020


2
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,780
   

3
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,305
   

4
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,439
Yancheng.

5
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,919
What was that sound I just heard, Chuqing?

6
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:04,260
It's nothing, I accidentally twisted my ankle.

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,839
Yancheng, I just remembered I have an important client to meet today.

8
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:09,760
Can you give me a ride?

9
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,799
Let's go.

10
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,220
   

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,499
How is my hand?

12
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,400
Your nerves have been damaged.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,860
I'm afraid that it will be difficult to recover without immediate surgery by an expert.

14
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,039
Doctor, I'm a designer.

15
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,499
Nothing can happen to my hand.

16
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,919
But there's nothing I can do about it.

17
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:43,540
The two best specialists in our hospital aren't available right now.

18
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,680
Doctor, if it doesn't heal properly,

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,819
will I never be able to hold a pen again?

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,259
Doctor, the two specialists have arrived.

21
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,359
Prepare for surgery immediately.

22
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,520
 Thank you for driving me here, Yancheng. 

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,340
 Goodbye. 

24
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,560
President Fu, I got a call from the construction site reporting that Miss Penny was injured.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,199
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Quickly, get in!

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,159
Doctor, how is she?

27
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,019
Is her hand okay? Will there be lasting effects?

28
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,839
President Fu, if you ask so many questions,

29
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,240
how is the doctor supposed to answer?

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,699
I'm sorry, doctor.

31
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,319
It's okay. Don't worry, President Fu. The surgery went very well.

32
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,360
She has been treated.

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,159
There won't be any lasting effects.

34
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,520
But she needs to stay in the hospital for a few days to recuperate.

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,499
Thank you.

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
You're awake.

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,599
Does your hand hurt?

38
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,439
Lie down, the doctor advised you to rest well.

39
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,740
Take it easy.

40
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,099
I'll take care of the rest for you.

41
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,759
Shouldn't you be accompanying Miss Xiao?

42
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,239
I won't trouble you.

43
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,020
I... Why?

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,280
You don't think I like Xiao Chuqing, do you?

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,520
I don't need to know who you like.

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,839
It's none of my business

47
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:55,319
But I want you to know.

48
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,120
Xiao Chuqing and I are only friends.

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,819
- The person I like is... 
 - Penny!

50
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,580
Yancheng, you're here, too.

51
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,959
I just heard about Penny's injury and rushed here to check on her.

52
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:12,179
I'll go and get your medicine. Take your time.

53
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,840
Are you feeling better now, Penny?

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,300
You must take care of yourself.

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,480
 So, Xiao Chuqing is behind everything. 

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
No matter how careful I am,

57
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,100
I can't fend against someone who keeps trying to harm me.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
You must be kidding.

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,879
Nobody wants to see you get hurt.

60
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,560
How could anyone want to harm you?

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,319
I'm tired. I need to rest.

62
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,420
Okay, get some rest.

63
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,000
The smell of those flowers gives me a headache.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,780
Take them away.

65
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,399
Yancheng, I'm really worried about Penny and that's why I came to visit her.

66
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,480
But she seems to be in a bad mood.

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Her hand was almost ruined.

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,759
Understandably, she's upset and in a bad mood.

69
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,879
It's really great that she's okay.

70
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,480
I blame myself for calling you away.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,279
That's why we didn't realize she was hurt.

72
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,799
Yancheng, you won't blame me, will you?

73
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:24,480
No. You didn't know this would happen.

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Thank you for taking care of Penny.

75
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,540
Take care of yourself, too.

76
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,959
The doctor says you should rest for a month after you're discharged.

77
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,479
And avoid touching the wound. And try not to use your right hand as well.

78
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,659
I understand.

79
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,620
By the way, after you're discharged later, come to my place and I'll take care of you.

80
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,179
No need for that, President Fu. I can go home.

81
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:56,279
I also bear a great responsibility for your severely injured hand.

82
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,120
Strictly speaking, this should be classified as a work-related injury.

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,219
No matter what, I should take care of you.

84
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,199
- But... 
 - No more hesitation.

85
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,120
That's settled then.

86
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,460
President Fu, if you're busy, you don't have to stay home to take care of me.

87
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,419
The housekeeper can handle it.

88
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,280
It's okay. Your hand was injured at work.

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,779
So, it's only natural for me to take care of you.

90
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,200
This chicken soup is nourishing for your body.

91
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,520
Drinking it will help your injury heal faster.

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,220
You made this?

93
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,440
No, the housekeeper made it.
