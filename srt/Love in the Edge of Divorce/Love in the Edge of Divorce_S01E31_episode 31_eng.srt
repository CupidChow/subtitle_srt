4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,520
You came to the hospital without telling me.

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,930
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,710
It's nothing.

7
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,460
I've just been working too hard lately.

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
My body is a little weak.

9
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,120
I came to the hospital to get some medicine.

10
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Get some medicine? What kind of medicine?

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,690
Abortion pills?

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,000
You know about this?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
Sheng Mian, I thought there would be no more lies between us.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,200
But it seems like that was just my wishful thinking.

15
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,110
Yancheng, I was planning to tell you about this tonight.

16
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,040
But the doctor said I might need to have an abortion right away.

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,790
I felt miserable and guilty because of this baby.

18
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,120
But I never dared mention the baby to you.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,400
I was afraid you'd be too sad.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,680
If I hadn't come to the hospital today,

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,840
would you have secretly aborted the baby on your own

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,590
and pretended nothing had happened?

23
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,070
The baby isn't yours alone.

24
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,950
Would you ever think about me before doing this kind of thing?

25
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,750
Exactly what do you truly feel in your heart?

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,390
Fu Yancheng.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,150
In the end, you just don't trust me.

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,710
Sheng Mian.

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,630
I adore you. I love you.

30
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,310
But I really don't want to live a lie anymore.

31
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm afraid about things like Penny and Liang Hanqing.

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm really scared.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,110
Sheng Mian, I just want to hear the truth from you.

34
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,550
Can you tell me the truth?

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,990
Okay.

36
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,990
The truth is...

37
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,190
♫  I am alone in the storm. After all, meetings cannot be replaced  ♫

38
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,180
Let's get a divorce.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,400
♫  You shake me when you appear  ♫

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,590
♫  I regard you as higher than the sky  ♫ 
 ♫  No one can replace you  ♫

41
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,810
♫  Is it a little ridiculous?  ♫

42
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,350
♫  The hug I once coveted  ♫ 
 ♫  I never had it for a second  ♫

43
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,900
♫ We continue to torment one another  ♫

44
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,320
♫  There is no passage to the future in this world  ♫

45
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,400
♫  Otherwise, it would have appeared before at the corner  ♫

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,230
♫  If I knew what you liked, love would be just right  ♫

47
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,470
♫  Those fantasies and promises are all illusory  ♫

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,200
♫  After loving, hating, and missing each other, we can be okay  ♫

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,230
♫  But my love has never receded because of this  ♫

50
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,660
♫  I can't forget you  ♫ 
 ♫  It's futile to worry about you  ♫

51
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,080
♫  You shake me when you appear  ♫

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,830
 Fu Yancheng. 

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,680
♫  Is it a little ridiculous?  ♫

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,320
 Help me. 

55
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,010
♫  I never had it for a second  ♫

56
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:18,070
♫  I actually still enjoy the unbearable torment  ♫

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,750
 Do you know who I am? 

58
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,200
 You're the one person I'll never be wrong about. 

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,360
 You're my husband. 

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,330
 Fu Yancheng. 

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,830
 I was afraid you wouldn't like me. 

62
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,070
 And that's why you're testing me. 

63
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,720
 I didn't mean that. 

64
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,510
 It's just... 

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,270
 Shut up. 

66
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,580
 Can't you be quiet even when you're eating? 

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,040
 Eat. 

68
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:21,530
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,390
 Are you so desperate to marry me? 

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,520
 Who said I want to marry you? 

71
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,410
 After tonight, we don't owe each other anymore. 

72
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,270
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

73
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,540
 I've transferred all the assets under my name to Sheng Mian without conditions. 

74
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,630
 Regardless of our future marital status, 

75
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,070
 she will have the power to protect Sheng Group. 

76
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,240
 Once I've decided, I never let go. 

77
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,280
 I could even give you my life. 

78
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,350
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

79
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,210
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

80
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,070
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

81
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,720
 Fu Yancheng, 

82
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,470
 we have still ended at the point of getting a divorce. 

83
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,480
Miss Sheng.

84
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,830
President said he didn't want to see you right now.

85
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,390
He had me draw up a new divorce agreement.

86
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,160
You can sign it and then leave.

87
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,720
Fu Yancheng really doesn't want to see me?

88
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,560
Maybe President Fu has some other important things to do.

89
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Okay.

90
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
It's better that we don't meet.

91
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,800
I'll sign this.

92
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,480
 Sheng Mian, 

93
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
 do you want to divorce me? 

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,800
 It's never going to happen. 

95
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,670
Madam, come this way.

96
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,670
Sheng Mian.

97
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,070
Wen Zhao.

98
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,430
I told Fu Yancheng.

99
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,560
He knows he misunderstood you.

100
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,510
And I gave him a lecture for you, too.

101
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,190
Go and pursue your happiness.

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,680
Sheng Mian, what happened before was all my fault.

103
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,040
I caused you two to be separated from each other.

104
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,830
I'll make it up to you in the future.

105
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,310
Auntie Bai, what is this?

106
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,360
Why are you still calling me "Auntie"?

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
Shouldn't you call me "Mom"?

108
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,240
Don't worry. Take things slowly.

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,520
Go on.

110
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,120
Grandfather!

111
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,430
I just knew it.

112
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,750
You're the right girl for him.

113
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,040
You two were born for each other.

114
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,780
Mian Mian, I wish you happiness.

115
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,720
Thank you, Grandfather.

116
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,440
Mian Mian!

117
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,200
It was so hard for you two to be together.

118
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Never mind.

119
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,870
When you get married,

120
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,910
I must sit at the main table.

121
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,670
Come on.

122
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,050
Thank you.

Before meeting you,

141
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,750
I was always a calm and rational person.

142

No one could disrupt my mood.

143

And no one could change my mind.

It was only when I met you that I understood and could feel

what love was.

146
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,740
I realized that love is missing you all the time.

147
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,270
It's wanting to give you all the good things in the world.

148
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,960
And to desperately want you.

Maybe this is Heaven testing me.

150
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,720
There are always misunderstandings between us.

And I have to say I loved you more each time

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,530
I will.

164
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:55,150
♫  Dreaming of you, thinking of you, loving you  ♫

165
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,610
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

166
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,090
♫  Watch the seasons turn and change  ♫

167
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,340
♫  Watch the rainstorms and the fog dissipate  ♫

168
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,160
♫  Watch the old moonlight fall into the palm of your hand  ♫

169
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:19,080
♫  Illuminate our new past... with you  ♫

170
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,170
♫  I hear you. I see you. I follow you  ♫

171
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:34,370
♫  Because of you, my life begins to have shadow and light  ♫

172
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:40,140
♫  Dreaming of you, thinking of you, loving you  ♫

173
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:48,050
♫  Where else can I find a better destiny than yours?  ♫

174
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,500
♫  You are the only one I need  ♫

175
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,030
♫  You are the only one I want  ♫

176
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,030
What's wrong?

177
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,180
The baby kicked me.

178
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,420
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

179
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:13,150
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

180
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:20,620
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

181
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:28,210
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

182
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:34,910
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

183
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:42,430
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

184
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:50,090
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

185
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,890
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

186
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,650
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

187
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,630
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

188
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,320
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

189
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,210
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

190
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,990
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

191
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:21,230
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
