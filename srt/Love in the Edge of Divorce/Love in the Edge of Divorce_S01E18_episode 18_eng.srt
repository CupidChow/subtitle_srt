3
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,380
   

4
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,879
Hello, Penny?

5
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,599
You aren't angry anymore?

6
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,619
Can you lend me a million?

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,599
Send me your account number. I'll transfer it to you right away.

8
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,120
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,059
No rush. I...

10
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,860
 Why does she suddenly need so much money? 

11
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,640
 Has something happened? 

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,940
Qi Chen, let's go. To Penny's studio.

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,680
 Pregnancy supplements? 

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,640
 Is Penny pregnant? 

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,759
President Fu, are you looking for Penny?

16
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,199
- She isn't here. 
 - Answer my question.

17
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,919
When was your last time with Penny?

18
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,439
 She never mentioned this detail to me. 

19
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,560
 How long should I say? 

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,080
- Half a year? 
 - Are you sure?

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,559
Or it could be a year.

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,719
Dad! Dad!

23
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,679
- You can't go in. 
 - Dad!

24
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,960
- You can't go in. 
 - Let me in! I'm begging you. Let me in!

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,240
- Dad! 
 - Please calm down.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,439
Don't interfere with our rescue.

27
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,399
Everyone get ready.

28
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,879
 Starting CPR now. 

29
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,439
 Everyone, take your positions. 

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
 Confirm there's no pulse. 

31
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,759
 There's no breathing. 

32
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,919
 Starting chest compression. 

33
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,839
100 to 120 per minute, depth 5 to 6 cm.

34
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,280
Open the airway.

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
 Prepare the bag-valve-mask for ventilation. 

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,959
 Set the oxygen flow to maximum. 

37
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,199
 Prepare for the first defibrillation. 

38
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,800
 Energy set to biphasic, 200 joules. 

39
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,960
 Continue chest compressions. 

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,600
 Monitor the patient's response. 

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
 Establish an IV line. 

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,000
 Administer 1 mg of epinephrine. 

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,839
 Continue resuscitation. 

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,719
 Stop compression. 

45
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,360
 The patient has no vital signs. 

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,039
 Pronounced clinically dead. 

47
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,360
 At 14:46. 

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,319
Dad!

49
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,420
Dad!

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,279
Dad…

51
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,360
 Dad… 

52
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,760
 I'm sorry. 

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,360
 It's my fault. 

54
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,599
 From now on, 

55
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,059
 I won't have any connection with the Fu family. 

56
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
Penny!

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,679
We have a child, right?

58
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
It's all my fault.

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,999
I've made you suffer.

60
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,920
I'll divorce Sheng Mian tomorrow.

61
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,199
Fu Yancheng.

62
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,079
Listen to me carefully.

63
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,439
The child isn't yours.

64
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,600
I know you're mad at me.

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,920
I understand.

66
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,000
This child can't possibly be Liang Hanqing's.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,640
I'll take responsibility. I'll take care of you and the baby.

68
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,930
How do you know there are no other men in my life?

69

70
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,600

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,720
The money I borrowed from you.

74
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,100
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫

78
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,360
 I've already told you. 

79
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,319
 You father doesn't care about you. 

80
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,759
 You have to fight for what you want. 

81
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,240
 Luckily, we have Lawyer Wang to help us. 

82
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,160
 Otherwise, we'd get nothing. 

83
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,120
Dad, you wronged me first.

84
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,879
Since everyone's here, I'll read President Sheng's will.

85
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,999
I bequeath all my shares in Sheng Group and all my assets

86
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:47,400
to my youngest daughter, Sheng Weiyuan.

87
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,160
 Why didn't Dad leave me anything? 

88
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,060
 This isn't right. 

89
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,480
Sister, don't blame Dad.

90
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,040
He probably thought you are so capable and independent,

91
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,639
so you don't need the family's help.

92
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm different.

93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,079
I've been sickly all my life and couldn't achieve much.

94
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,800
I think that's why Dad left everything to me.

95
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,939
So, he really cared about you.

96
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,679
According to the will, this house will be mine and Mom's.

97
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,840
But you can still come visit us, Sis.

98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,960
We're still family.

99
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,200
President Fu, I've never seen anyone sneaking into their own house.

100
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,799
Penny doesn't want to see me right now.

101
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,100
She's pregnant. I don't want to upset her.

102
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,160
Penny, what's wrong?

103
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,879
 Are you okay, Penny? 

104
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,559
Are you okay? Wake up!

105
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,960
- Penny. 
 - Make way!

106
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,679
Penny? What's wrong?

107
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,979
- Qi Chen! Get the car! 
 - Okay.

108
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,559
Penny?

109
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,779
How do you feel now?

110
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,200
Thank you for bringing me here.

111
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,159
You should leave now.

112
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,879
Penny, stop rejecting me.

113
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,200
Let me take care of you.

114
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you remember the last car accident?

115
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,700
You said it yourself: if I wake up, I can ask for anything.

116
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,799
Please, let's stop torturing each other.

117
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,439
No matter whose child this is, I'll treat them as my own.

118
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,500
President Fu.

119
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,159
Please leave.

120
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,559
We did the wrong thing from the beginning.

121
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,919
It's time to end this now.

122
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:44,200
I never expected so much to happen in such a short time.

123
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,240
I apologize to you on behalf of the Fu family.

124
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,480
If I'd known you'd be treated this way,

125
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,039
I wouldn't have asked you to marry Yancheng.

126
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,659
Grandfather,

127
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,079
please allow me to divorce Fu Yancheng.

128
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,559
Mian Mian, I know you've suffered.

129
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,559
There's a party at Fu's Holiday Hotel in a few days.

130
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,519
You can rest there.

131
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,679
Give yourself several days to think it over.

132
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,679
If you insist on the divorce when you come back,

133
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,520
I won't stop you.

134
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,639
Who's this, just staying here and expecting me to greet them?

135
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,360
It's the grandchild of Old Master Fu's friend.

136
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,760
He just wants you to show up to convey the Fu's family's respect.

137
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:52,970


138
