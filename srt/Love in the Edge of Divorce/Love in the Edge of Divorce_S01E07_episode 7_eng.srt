1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,850


2
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,515
   

3
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:48,490
   

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,679
Penny, could you bring me the camera from my bag, please?

5
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,390
♫  It is a storm of memories  ♫ 
  ♫  I am still obsessed with it  ♫

6
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,890
♫  The ticket to enter your world was torn off by your own hands  ♫

7
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,170
♫  My hobby is to have you and be able to rely on you  ♫

8
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,640
♫  I can let go of the fact that there is no answer to refer to. 
 What should I do?  ♫

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,240
♫  I don't know. I don't want to know. No need to know  ♫

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,430
♫  I am alone in the storm. After all, meetings cannot be replaced  ♫

11
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,040
Let's go.

12
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,020
Thank you for rescuing me.

13
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,040
I'll wash the jacket and return it to you.

14
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,819
- Where are you going? I'll take you. 
 - No, thanks.

15
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,480
Are you angry?

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,419
If you didn't want to come to a party like this, you didn't have to come.

17
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,759
I'm not angry.

18
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,000
What right have I to be angry?

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,520
Having the chance to design your villa is the best thing I can ever have.

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,740
I really cherish the opportunity to cooperate with you, President Fu.

21
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,479
Are we just business partners?

22
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,159
What else?

23
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,060
Since you like someone, please don't do things that can be misleading.

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,899
- The person I like is... 
 - President Fu, everyone is waiting for you.

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,240
I don't agree. Penny did nothing wrong.

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,199
Why stop the collaboration, Grandfather?

27
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,800
I heard you had your arms around her in front of everyone.

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,719
That's unbecoming! It's a disgrace to the Fu family!

29
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,520
Mian Mian studies interior design.

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,700
You should've let her design your home!

31
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,120
Why did you find another woman?

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
Do you want her to beg you for the opportunity?

33
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,759
She isn't begging me.

34
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,680
Grandfather, can't you see that Sheng Mian only wants money?

35
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
I... I think you've lost your mind!

36
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,439
No, I haven't!

37
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,280
Tell me! Who is that designer?

38
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,159
Fu Yancheng, are you trying to drive me mad?

39
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,520
Grandfather! Grandfather!

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,280
Grandfather, are you okay? Don't scare me!

41
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't be angry, Grandfather.

42
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,000
You would rather die than tell me who she is.

43
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,000
There's nothing I can do with you.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
But you've let Mian Mian down.

45
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,160
You need to make it up to her.

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,040
Or you're never entering this mansion again!

47
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,079
 Sheng Mian. 

48
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,059
 It's you again. 

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,399
President Fu, here's the file you wanted.

50
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,040
Leave it there.

51
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,679
Then, I'll be leaving.

52
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,000
Qi Chen told me about it.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,279
You didn't want to reveal my identity,

54
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,560
so you ended up getting hurt by Grandfather.

55
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,639
I'm fine.

56
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,099
President Fu, if you don't mind,

57
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,539
let me help you treat it.

58
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,820
I'm sorry. I'll be more gentle.

59
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,759
Does it still hurt?

60
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,679
I feel much better with you here.

61
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,220
President Fu, I'll help you with the treatment...

62
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,199
I have to go.

63
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,140
President Fu, what ability do you think I want the most?

64
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,879
Invisibility. Definitely invisibility.

65
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,839
President, is there something on your mind?

66
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,460
What do you think?

67
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,720
I think yes.

68
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,439
And, it's about love.

69
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,720
Once again, you understand?

70
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,379
Get back here.

71
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,720
If a woman suddenly blows hot and cold, what does that mean?

72
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
 A woman? 

73
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,879
 Just say Penny. 

74
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,639
 So obvious. 

75
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,480
Did it happen after a close female friend showed up here?

76
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,639
- It seems so. 
 - Then it has to be this. She's probably jealous.

77
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:45,080
- Jealous? 
 - If you aren't sure, how about pretending to be close to that friend

78
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,960
to see how this woman feels about it?

79
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,860
Childish. How could I do something like that?

80
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,120
Yancheng, you are unusually relaxed today.

81
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,759
I'm surprised that you invited me here.

82
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,600
I just want you, great designer Xiao, to see how the design is.

83
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,120
Pretty good in general.

84
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,479
But compared with international trends,

85
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,199
the aesthetic is a bit more conservative.

86
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,040
Chuqing, your hair's a little messy.

87
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,759
Let me help you with it.

88
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,680
What shall we do later? How about going to get a cup of coffee?

89
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
You're avoiding me.

90
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,519
- I'm just working. 
 - Are you?

91
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,460
My relationship with Xiao Chuqing makes you jealous, right?

92
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,799
No.

93
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,439
What right have I to interfere with your love life?

94
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,859
You can have that right, as long as you want it.

95
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,139
You must be kidding, President Fu.

96
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:11,890


97
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,990
 "The Page You Appeared On" 

98
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:28,760
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

99
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:36,080
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

100
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,730
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

101
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:50,340
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

102
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,200
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down,  ♫

103
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,090
♫  when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

104
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:05,610
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

105
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,460
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

106
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,180
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

107
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,050
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

108
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,880
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

109
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,690
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

110
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,510
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

111
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:37,070
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
