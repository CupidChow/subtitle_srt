00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:16,070

00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,740
   

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,251
   

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,440
Who's this, just a guest staying here and expecting me to greet them?

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,259
It's the grandchild of a friend of Old Master Fu.

6
00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:01,159
He just wants you to show up to convey the Fu's family's respect.

7
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,400
Grandfather, I've arrived.

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,280
What is this?

9
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,719
Later, you'll have dinner with the grandchild to get to know each other.

10
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,259
Two men having a candlelight dinner…

11
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,539
It's not impossible, right?

12
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,459
Qi Chen, what the heck is going on?

13
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,200
It was Old Master Fu.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,139
He tricked you into coming here to try to match you with Miss Sheng.

15
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:09,439
Miss Sheng is already in her room and will be brought here soon.

16
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,759
That scheming woman.

17
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,499
Grandfather has been tricked again.

18
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,360
Which room is Sheng Mian in?

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,079
She's in...

20
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,360
Room 8802.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,199
Prepare two divorce papers for me.

22
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,199
But the Old Master Fu said...

23
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,460
Do as I say.

24
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,360
Okay. I'll go and see to it.

25
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,000
Come back.

26
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,080
Tell them to clear this away.

27
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,419
But...

28
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,360
 Sheng Mian. 

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,479
 You've really gone all out to avoid a divorce. 

30
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,720
 Since you're here at the hotel, let's settle this. 

31
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,059
Grandfather, you're so nice.

32
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,479
You even arranged dinner for me.

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,179
Thanks, Grandfather.

34
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,319
You're Sheng Mian.

35
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,420
 So, Grandfather invited me here to arrange a reconciliation between Fu Yancheng and I. 

36
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,519
 In that case, I'll divorce you as Penny. 

37
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,239
Sheng Mian sent me here.

38
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,039
Did she do anything to you?

39
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,860
She warned me that as long as you don't go ahead with the divorce,

40
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll always be your mistress.

41
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,560
She's playing the victim to Grandfather while humiliating you here.

42
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,599
She's so calculating.

43
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,560
- Come on. Let's go in. 
 - I don't want to see her.

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,999
As long as I can see you, I don't care what others say.

45
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,879
Penny.

46
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,000
After you kicked me out of the hospital, I've really missed you.

47
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,660
After tonight,

48
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,680
you'll divorce Sheng Mian. Right?

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't want things to stay like this.

50
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,540
Okay. I won't let you suffer anymore.

51
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,820
I don't care what she said to you.

52
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,299
Only you can be my wife.

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,039
How could I possibly be your wife?

54
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,040
I'm just a paltry designer.

55
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,479
We aren't compatible.

56
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,759
There's no "compatible" or "incompatible" in love.

57
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,900
There's just love or no love.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,300
If anything, I blame myself for not meeting you sooner.

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,039
 President Fu, Old Master Fu knows that you missed the candelight dinner. He's really angry. 

69
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,719
 Think of something to deal with this. 

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
I understand.

71
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,480
You go back now.

72
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,600
Grandfather wants to talk to me.

73
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,680
I'll explain things to him.

74
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,239
After tonight, I'll end everything with Sheng Mian.

  - I tried so hard to get Mian Mian there. Yet, you want to divorce her. 

86
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,479
 Listen! Either you get my granddaughter-in-law back, 

87
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,120
or else you'll be returning to my funeral tomorrow!

88
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,799
Grandfather, I'm begging you.

89
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,759
Stop interfering in our business.

90
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,659
Even though I'm your grandson, I still have my own life.

91
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,819
I just want to be with the person I love.

92
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,759
Bring the woman you like here tomorrow.

93
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,740
 I want to meet her. 

94
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:03,679
You're being so secretive.

95
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,720
What are you trying to do?

96
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,799
You'll know soon.

97
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,399
Grandfather.

98
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,659
Penny, I'm introducing you to my grandfather.

99
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,439
Fu Yancheng, is this the woman you like?

100
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,779
So affectionate in front of me.

101
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,159
Not like a decent woman.

102
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,960
Turn your head.

103
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,463
Don't worry.

104
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:33,959
I won't be harsh to you.

105
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,599
It's okay. I'm here.

106
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,240
- You... 
 - Hello, Grandpa.

107
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,420
My name is Penny. My first time meeting you...

108
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,239
Please forgive me; I'm a little nervous.

109
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,080
Grandfather, this is the woman I've always liked.

110
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,160
Let's sit down and talk.

111
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,379
Grandfather, let me help you.

112
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,039
Grandfather, don't tell him that I'm Sheng Mian.

113
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,060
I'll explain it to you later.

114
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,939
Grandfather, I'm sorry. I didn't know I'd meet you today.

115
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,240
So, I brought nothing.

116
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,399
Don't be so polite.

117
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,479
We're a...

118
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,859
We're all straightforward people here.

119
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:41,759
I'm here today to ask both of you what you are thinking.

120
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,480
Grandfather, I want to marry Penny.

121
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,960
What do you think, Mian...

122
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,700
Young lady? What about you?

123
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,340
What do you think?

124
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,039
Grandfather,

125
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,579
I know I'm not worthy of Yancheng.

126
00:10:57,579 --> 00:10:59,920
- Who said you aren't? 
 - Who said you aren't?

127
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,839
Grandfather, you agree?

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,080
Tell me more.

129
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,200
What makes you think you aren't worthy?

130
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
President Fu comes from a prestigious family.

131
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,059
He's handsome and talented, and has achieved so much at such a young age.

132
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,860
He's truly an exceptional man.

133
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,240
I'm no more than just a designer.

134
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,919
Of course, I'm not good enough for him.

135
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,540
So, in your eyes, I'm this perfect?

136
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,939
There's no such thing as worthiness in love.

137
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,079
As long as there's love, it's enough.

138
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,799
Grandfather.

139
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,600
Please give us your blessings.

140
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,759
Well...

141
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,039
As for our Yancheng's marital status,

142
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,459
you must be aware of it. Right?

143
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:57,360
Miss Penny, are you single?

144
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,440
Grandpa, I…

145
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,840
I'm married, too.

146
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,780
Do you truly love our Yancheng?

147
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:11,960
Yes, I love Yancheng very much.

148
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,700
That's great! That's all I needed to hear.

149
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,639
My business here is done.

150
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,039
Grandfather, why are you leaving?

151
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,539
So, does that mean you agree?

152
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,739
I agree!

153
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
Did you hear that? Grandfather has agreed!

154
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,679
Can you please let me know about these things in advance next time?

155
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,399
I don't like surprises like this.

156
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,439
Are you upset?

157
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,500
I just wanted Grandfather to know that you're a good woman.

158
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
But our current relationship isn't presentable before family members.

159
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,639
I'll get the divorce done tomorrow.

160
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,320
Wait for me.

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:56,720
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

163
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,060
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

164
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,660
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

165
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,290
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

166
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,910
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

167
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:33,610
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

168
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,440
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

169
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,170
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

170
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,950
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

171
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,640
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

172
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,630
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

173
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,440
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

174
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:04,850
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
