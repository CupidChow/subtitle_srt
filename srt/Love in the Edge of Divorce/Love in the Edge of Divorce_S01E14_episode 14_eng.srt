00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,553
   

3
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,450
   

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,020
I'm so sorry, I've got the wrong person.

5
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,870
President Fu, can I go now?

6
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,950
You really don't want to see my mom, do you?

7
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,340
If you'd like to, I can formally take you to see her.

8
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,310
Now isn't the right time.

9
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,760
All right.

10
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,150
I've done as you told me.

11
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,040
Penny will drink that wine,

12
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,510
and I've already told them to go all the way

13
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,580
so that it'll be veryexciting.

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,960
I can't show up,

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,750
so I'll have to rely on you to lead people over to catch them in the act.

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,900
Remember this. Make sure Madam Bai witnesses it.

17
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,780
Don't worry.

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,190
 Penny, just now I let you slip away. 

19
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,470
 But just wait. 

20
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,830
 You'll have a grand debut before Madam Bai. 

21
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,030
I just saw my boyfriend enter this room with that wretch!

22
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,740
I've been with him for five years, I can't believe he's cheating on me.

23
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,560
Please. You have to be a witness for me.

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,470
Okay, all right, we'll do that.

25
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,380
You wretch! How dare you seduce my boyfriend!

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,910
Get out! Get out!

27
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,670
Chuqing, why are you here?

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,310
Stop filming! Get out!

29
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,800
Out! Everyone, get out!

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Who the heck is here making such a fuss at my son's gala?

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Chuqing.

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,630
Aunt.

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,760
All of you, get out.

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
Aunt, let me explain.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
Chuqing, how could you do such a thing?

36
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,380
I'm so disappointed.

37
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,630
 Once she thinks I'm a frivolous girl, 

38
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,360
 Fu Yancheng and I will have no chance at all. 

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,420
Aunt, this is all just a misunderstanding.

40
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,830
Just look at this.

41
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,270
This is...

42
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,840
It's the suit I got tailored for Yancheng.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,180
How did this get here?

44
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,280
- Is he... 
 - Yes, Yancheng was the one here with me.

45
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,750
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

46
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,610
Yancheng is busy, so he left.

47
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,680
I didn't tell everyone here

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,480
in order to maintain the Fu family's dignity.

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,120
You're a good girl.

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,230
I misunderstood you.

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,630
Yancheng has never treated any other girl like this.

52
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,220
From now on, you're officially the Fu's daughter-in-law,

53
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,990
I'll help you to chase Sheng Mian away.

54
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,960
Thank you, Aunt.

55
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,160
Can you leave first?

56
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,210
I want to take a shower and dress up.

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,040
How could Yancheng leave you here like this?

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,900
Good girl, just rest well.

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,460
What a witch; such a quick change of face.

60
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,950
 Chuqing, how are you doing? 

61
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,870
 Did Auntie make things hard for you? 

62
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,340
 I'm so sorry, I had no idea that waiter would take you as Penny. 

63
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,270
Enough, stop this nonsense.

64
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,410
Listen, I don't care what you do,

65
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,080
but you find that waiter, give him hush money, and

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,360
tell him to get out of this hotel. He must never come back.

67
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,300
The one who slept with me tonight can only be Fu Yancheng.

68
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,460
All right, I'll definitely do that well.

69
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,360
So, this misfortune may prove to be a blessing in disguise.

70
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,720
It's good that the old witch thinks

71
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,480
Fu Yancheng and I slept together.

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,280
That way, she'll support me in this.

73
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,660
 Yancheng. 

74
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,240
 Yancheng 

75
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,350
 Hello, you've got the wrong person. 

76
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,800
 I'm not Yancheng. 

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,510
 Don't try to avoid me. 

78
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,190
 This is clearly the suit that you were in today. 

79
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,230
 President Fu just gave me this suit that's stained. 

80
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,560
 So, this girl has mistaken me for him. 

81
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,820
 When that girl is really drunk, take her to that room. 

82
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,560
 Make sure you make it intense. 

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,310
 You're Penny. 

84
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,730
 Penny, I'm Penny. 

85
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,310
 As long as you're with me, 

86
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,070
 it doesn't matter if you take me as Penny. 

87
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,880
 Miss Penny, I'll take you to your room. 

88
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,850
How could you drink so much?

89
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,600
I didn't drink much.

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,990
I just drank this little.

91
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,430
I'll take you back.

92
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,750
I don't want to go back.

93
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,160
I want to drink more!

94
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,480
They said that depending on how much I drink,

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,830
they'll give me an equivalent in business.

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,920
Be good, I'll take you back.

Don't go.

Do you know who I am?

You're my husband,

118
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,850
Fu Yancheng.

119
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,900
Then do you like Fu Yancheng?

120
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,240
I do.

121
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,740
But I think I shouldn't like him.

122
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,380

 You're my husband,

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,840
 Fu Yancheng. 

131
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,340
 Then do you like Fu Yancheng? 

132
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,050
 I do. 

133
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,780
You're finally admitting there's a place for me in your heart.

134
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,960
 Yancheng, something urgent has come up at home. 

135
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,010
 You should come back. 

136
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,960
 Madam, I've sent people to check it out. 

137
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,080
 The surveillance cameras in the hotel corridor were switched off, 

138
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,600
 so there's no way to verify if Miss Xiao was telling the truth or not. 

139
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,720
 Madam, Miss Xiao is deeply in love with young Master Fu. 

140
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,910
 I don't think she would lie. 

141
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,150
It's exactly because she's deeply in love with him that she would lie.

142
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,480
After all, everyone wants to be our daughter-in-law.

143
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,420
I don't want another dubious woman around after that Sheng Mian is gone.

144
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,100
- That's enough.
 - Mom, why were you looking for me so urgently?

145
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,500
Sit.

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,480
Yancheng, did anyone try to take advantage of you at the hotel last night?

147
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,480
Mom, she didn't take advantage of me. She isn't like any other girl.

148
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,360
She's the one I'm after, and I love her so much.

149
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,870
So, I don't want you to interfere between us.

150
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,030
 Seems like Xiao Chuqing didn't lie. 

151
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,440
 Yancheng was really with her last night. 

152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,600
 I didn't think Yancheng would like her so much. 

153
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,200
It's good you've got someone you truly love,

154
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,270
and I won't interfere between you two.

155
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,810
Since you really like her, and you've already slept with her,

156
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,790
you should quickly break up with that untrustworthy Sheng Mian.

157
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,840
Don't worry, I'll do that.

158
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,720
 So, Yancheng was with Penny last night. 

159
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,370
 Penny, I will make you pay for this. 

160
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,670
My head hurts so much.

161
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,040
How long have I slept?

162
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,002
Last night...

163
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,200
 Director He, I'll toast you. 

164
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,480
 Mr. Ji, nice to meet you. 

165
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,960
 Director Wang, please take good care of me in the future. 

166
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,900
 We definitely won't let you down. 

167
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,010
What happened next? Why can't I remember?

168
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,040

 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

171
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,780
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

172
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:13,090
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

173
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:20,790
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

174
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:27,410
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

175
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:35,080
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

176
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,740
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

177
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,480
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

178
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,230
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

179
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,150
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

180
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,910
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

181
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,640
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

182
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,600
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

183
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,880
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
