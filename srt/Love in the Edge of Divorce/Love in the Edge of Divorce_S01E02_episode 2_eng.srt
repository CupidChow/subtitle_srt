2
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,790
   

3
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,358
   

4
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,040
Young Fu is back.

5
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,500
Yancheng, you're back.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,560
Madam, President Fu has an important meeting tonight.

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,719
- He won't be back for dinner. 
  - It isn't him. 

8
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,999
He asked me to bring the divorce agreement here.

9
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:10,539
Once Ms. Sheng signs it, there will be a one-month cooling-off period.

10
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,400
After that, we can get the divorce certificate.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,959
I know he's busy.

12
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,319
Remind him to take care of himself.

13
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,140
Yes, Madam.

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,240
 Is that President Fu's wife? 

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,799
Hurry and sign it.

16
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,319
After a month, go to the Civil Affairs Bureau and get the divorce certificate.

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,160
Penny.

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,159
Good morning, Penny.

19
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,480
What happened?

20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,540
Aiyo, Penny! Thank goodness you're here.

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,319
A while ago, I heard about a business deal that was guaranteed to make money.

22
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,900
So, I used our studio as collateral for a loan and invested some money. 
    

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,040
What?

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,659
You used the studio as collateral?!

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,699
I admit it wasn't the best decision.

26
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,560
But now we need to pay the money back.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,859
Otherwise, the bank will take over our studio.

28
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,339
We worked so hard all these years to build the studio into what it is today.

29
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,659
- You... 
 - I'm sorry!

30
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,719
I'm really sorry! I know I messed up!

31
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,940
But, you know what?

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,980
I have a way to save the studio.

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,420
Come on, have a seat.

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,500
Sit.

35
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,099
You know Fu Yancheng, the president of Fu Group. Right?

36
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,820
Fu Yancheng?

37
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,479
He just spent a fortune buying a luxury villa at Royal View Garden.

38
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,599
It's said to be a wedding house for his first love, Xiao Chuqing.

39
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,439
The president of Fu Group and the beloved daughter of Xiao Group?

40
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,080
The design fee must be astronomical.

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,539
Just that one deal can save our studio.

42
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,879
- But... 
 - Junior!

43
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,960
Our studio's survival now depends on you.

44
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,280
Okay.

45
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
Tonight at 8:00. The Night Bar.

46
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,579
Don't be late.

47
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,560
 Cousin, come to the Night Bar now. 

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,059
 I have a big gift for you. 

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,120
Hi, handsome.

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,300
Qi Chen, handle this.

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
Where are you?

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,639
 I'm in the private room next door. 

53
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,800
 Come and greet my friend. 

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,319
Are these the great gifts you have for me?

55
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,860
 Of course not. These are just ordinary women. 

56
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,300
 The real surprise is on the way. 

57
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,140
President Fu...

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,960
It's you.

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,599
I'm sorry, President Fu.

60
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,499
If I said it wasn't on purpose,

61
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,580
just a coincidence, would you believe me?

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,819
You're very good at creating coincidences.

63
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,140
I'm sorry, President Fu.

64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,639
Let me wipe it off for you.

65
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,160
Stop.

66
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
Did Lin Jing call you here?

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,080
Yes. Let's make a proper introduction.

68
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,599
How much did Lin Jing pay you for this job?

69
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,399
After tax, several million.

70
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,939
Millions after sleeping together? 
 ("Sleeping" sounds like "tax")

71
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,975
With your face and figure, you've got some nerve.

72
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,020
President Fu, I'm just being honest.

73
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,279
Your project is big, time-consuming,

74
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,399
and I heard you have very high standards.

75
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,759
Most people couldn't meet them.

76
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,260
But don't worry, if you choose me, my services will exceed your expectations.

77
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,039
Enough!

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,240
President Fu, first, tell me what style you like.

79
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,379
I always adapt to my client's preferences.

80
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,560
I can also show you some of my past work.

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,140
Wait a moment.

82
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,220
Where is my phone...?

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,800
What are you doing?

84
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,820
President Fu, I just want you to give us a chance.

85
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,580
I know you're busy, but just give me one minute.

86
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,160
I promise you'll be satisfied.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,439
One minute?

88
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,859
Are you looking down on me?

89
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,699
Haven't you already experienced how long I can last?

90
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:48,120
I...

91
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,159
I did.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,460
What?

93
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,279
So eager to try again?

94
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,800
President Fu, I just want to persuade you.

95
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,279
Persuade me?

96
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,979
You're quite bold.

97
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,240
President Fu, I know you might not believe me now.

98
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
But I'm indeed experienced. And I've had many returning clients.

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,720
I won't disappoint you.

100
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,320
Experienced.

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,800
Returning clients?

102
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Wasn't that your first time?

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
First time?

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,559
How could that be my first time?

105
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,860
I've been working in this industry for three years.

106
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,659
Tell Lin Jing this. I don't need your service.

107
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,460
Okay, I'll wait for Director Lin here.

108
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,900
Is Lin Jing one of your clients, too?

109
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,160
Sort of.

110
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,020
Disgusting.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Disgusting? What's wrong with him?

112
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,639
What did I say to offend him?

113
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,419
So strange.

114
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
Director Lin.

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,480
 Penny, how did it go with my cousin? 

116
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,000
He didn't seem to like me.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,480
He left without seeing the proposal.

118
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,519
 Sorry about that. 

119
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,940
 My cousin is indeed not easy to deal with. 

120
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,980
 But it's okay. 

121
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,560
 Tomorrow, there's a Design Industry Networking Reception hosted by Fu Group. 

122
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,779
 You can talk to him more there. 

123
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,885
That's great! Then I'll definitely attend.

124
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:19,003
Thank you, Director Lin.

125
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:21,338
   

126
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,699
Penny!

127
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,639
Director Zhang, what a coincidence.

128
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,959
Our great designer.

129
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,160
I've been meaning to find a chance to collaborate with you again.

130
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,359
Director Zhang, you've had too much to drink. Let me help you out.

131
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,219
No, I'm not drunk yet.

132
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,820
You should know how much I can drink!

133
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,579
This way. Over here.

134
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,279
President Fu.

135
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,680
- Mr. Fu. 
 - Talking about nothing but money.

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,959
Don't you have any feelings?

137
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,079
Your client...

138
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:19,120
President Fu, I still want to know your preferred style.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,419
I can try anything.

140
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,360
Oh, she has plenty of styles.

141
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
Yes. And if you aren't satisfied,

142
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,879
I promise I won't charge any fees.

143
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,240
You seem to have plenty of clients.

144
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
- Are you short on money? 
 - Penny does everything well.

145
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,340
Just a bit expensive.

146
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,799
 He's been harsh to me. 

147
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,260
 Maybe he's worried that I have too many clients and will neglect quality? 

148
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,160
 That makes sense. 

149
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,520
Don't worry on that account, President Fu.

150
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,260
If I take on this project for you, I won't accept any others.

151
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,799
If you're interested, give me five minutes to discuss the details.

152
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,519
Promoting this in front of everyone.

153
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,479
Do you have no sense of shame?

154
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,840
President Fu!

155
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,120
What's wrong with discussing it publicly?

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,539
Now, what have I done to make him mad?

157
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,159
Our cooperation...

158
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,719
Mrs. Zhang, Director Zhang is safe in his car.

159
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:09,760
Don't worry.

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,919
Next time, let's have a meal together.

161
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,919
 That's Fu Yancheng's car. 

162
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,440
Director Xiao, President Fu will meet you the day after tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

163
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
at Sun and Moon Tennis Courts to talk with you.

164
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,323
We haven't decided on a design company yet.

165
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:27,119
 Assistant Qi. You know this. 
   

166
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:30,539
Our Scorching Sun Design is the largest and most prominent one in the industry.

167
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,639
Besides, I heard this villa is meant to be a wedding house for my sister, Xiao Chuqing.

168
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,679
 So, as her brother, I would be the best one to handle this. Right? 

169
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,120
Assistant Qi, do your best to convince President Fu to choose me.

170
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,799
I understand. But President Fu will make the final decision.

171
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,379
All right then, let's leave it at that.

172
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:53,379
 Scorching Sun Design. 

173
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,679
 Xiao Chuqing's younger brother. 

174
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,960
 If they finalize their cooperation tomorrow, the studio will be doomed. 

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,599
 This won't do. 

176
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,399
What's this?

177
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm sorry, President Fu. My mistake.

178
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,799
It's probably from a design company seeking collaboration.

179
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,400
- I'll throw it away immediately. 
 - Wait.

180
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,440
This design proposal looks good.

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,480
Hurry and get in touch with this designer.

182
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,280
Understood, President Fu.

183
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
 Why didn't you stop her from divorcing Fu Yancheng? 

184
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,939
 Companies that cooperated with us before, out of respect for the Fu family, 

185
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:47,480
 are canceling contracts and withdrawing investments. 

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,279
 The company is about to start the second round of financing. 

187
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,379
 If she divorces him now, what will happen to the company? 

188
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:57,320
The Fu family and Mian Mian have already done their best.

189
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,080
I'll figure out the issues with the company.

190
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,559
Don't get Mian Mian involved.

191
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,639
You fainted at the shareholders' meeting today.

192
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,000
What method can you come up with?

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
 If the Fu family doesn't cooperate with us, 

194
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,759
 the company won't secure the second round of financing. 

195
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,499
 The company will collapse. What will happen to me and our child? 

196
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:12,759
She must not divorce him right now.

197
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,200
- I'm going to talk to her. 
 - Enough!

198
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,999
 She has her own life. 

199
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,780
 I don't need her to sacrifice herself for this family. 

200
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,720
President Fu, the lawyer called me this morning.

201
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,479
Sheng Mian said that she needs more time to consider the matter.

202
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,000
She agreed so quickly before.

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
Now, she's going back on her word.

204
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
What exactly is she trying to do?

205
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,000
Su Lan, President Sheng's wife, requested

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,480
Fu Group continue investing in Sheng's company.

207
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,019
So, they just want money.

208
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,960
Fine, tell her to talk to my lawyer.

209
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Investment is possible. Just this once.

210
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,540
- After the investment, the divorce must happen immediately. 
 - Understood.

211
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,859
Also, Director Xiao wants to play tennis with you tomorrow.

212
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,340
Understood.

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,159
You are very skilled.

214
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,240
No wonder you're a famous tennis master.

215
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,519
Even an ex-athlete like me can't compare.

216
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,099
Director Xiao, don't flatter me. Just tell me what's on your mind.

217
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,440
President Fu, will you be living in that villa alone,

218
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,599
or is it a new marital home?

219
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:26,980
President Fu, regarding the villa's design, you must seriously consider us.

220
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,679
Look, professionally, our company is the industry leader.

221
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,679
We'll surely assign the best designer to you.

222
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,679
And when it comes to ties, you and my sister are childhood sweethearts.

223
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,039
Our families have been close for years.

224
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,419
No matter how you look at it,

225
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:44,279
entrusting this project to me is undoubtedly the best choice.

226
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,679
President Fu.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,990

 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

229
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:49,870
♫  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  ♫

230
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:57,250
♫  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  ♫

231
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:04,650
♫  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  ♫

232
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:11,440
♫  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  ♫

233
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:19,060
♫  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  ♫

234
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:26,720
♫  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  ♫

235
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,550
♫  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  ♫

236
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,370
♫  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  ♫

237
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,110
♫  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  ♫

238
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,020
♫  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  ♫

239
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,800
♫  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  ♫

240
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,660
♫  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  ♫

241
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:58,130
♫  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  ♫
