1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:09,880


2
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,537
   

3
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:48,380
   

4
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,559
The baby...

5
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,000
The baby...

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,640
The baby...

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,239
 Without the baby, what else do you have to compete against me with? 

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,519
Sister!

9
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,719
Ambulance! Hurry. Call an ambulance!

10
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,400
Sister! Sister!

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,239
Help! Call an ambulance!

12
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,420
Sister!

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,250
   

14
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,580
You can't go inside!

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,200
Doctor, how is my sister?

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,360
She has lost so much blood that I'm afraid the baby can't be saved.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,079
We need a family member to sign for the surgery immediately.

18
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,079
Are you a family member?

19
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm her sister.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,719
But I can't make decisions.

21
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,840
I'll call my brother-in-law.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,920
 Brother-in-law, my sister is in the hospital right now. 

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,879
 She's in grave danger! You'd better come over here quickly. 

24
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,439
Is Sheng Mian pulling tricks to avoid the divorce again?

25
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,020
I'm not lying to you, Brother-in-law. Her life is in danger now!

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,400
 She was calling your name when she was just brought in. 

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
She really loves you. Won't you reconsider the divorce?

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Enough! Don't play tricks on me!

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,240
There's nothing to discuss between us except for the divorce.

30
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,120
My brother-in-law can't come.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,200
What should we do?

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,959
Nothing can be more important than his wife's surgery right now.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
Sister.

34
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,800
Thank goodness, you're finally awake!

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,680
How are you feeling?

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,719
The baby...

37
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,680
Is my baby still alive?

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,400
The baby may not make it.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,559
The circumstances were so serious at the time.

40
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:45,899
I called my brother-in-law, but he didn't come.

41
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,900
So, it caused some delay.

42
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,220
Sister, maybe something truly did come up for him.

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,460
Stop. I don't want to hear it.

44
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,220
You can go back now.

45
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,400
Leave me alone.

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,439
I'll go back and pack some things for you.

47
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:10,840
 I just want to deepen the misunderstanding between you two. 

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,319
Come out, Sheng Mian!

49
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,979
Sheng Mian!

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,160
Are you Sheng Mian？

51
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm Sheng Weiyuan. Her young sister.

52
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,299
Come out, Sheng Mian!

53
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,079
Running away won't solve the problem.

54
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,240
Let's get this straight today.

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,959
Are you going to divorce me or not?

56
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,820
Come out, Sheng Mian!

57
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,319
Sheng Mian! Come out!

58
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,719
Brother-in-law, how could you be so heartless!

59
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,399
You didn't come when my sister needed you to sign papers at the hospital.

60
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,920
 She's still lying in the hospital. 

61
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,680
 Do you have to talk about divorce right now? 

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
 I don't care if Sheng Mian is dead or alive. 

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,300
She will really come up with any means to avoid getting a divorce.

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,839
 Since you're hiding her and preventing her from meeting me, 

65
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,239
 don't blame me for taking drastic measures. 

66
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,304
   

67
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,690
   

68
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,345
   

69
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,839
There are five minutes left before the court session begins.

70
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,560
If the defendant, Sheng Mian, doesn't arrive by then,

71
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,839
she will be treated as absent.

72
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,999
 Penny? 

73
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:38,051
   

74
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:47,600
The defendant, Sheng Mian, is present.

75
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,680
The court is now in session.

76
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,339
Penny?

77
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,639
Are you Sheng Mian?

78
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,319
Yes.

79
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,199
I am indeed Sheng Mian.

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,720
Judge, please proceed with the trial whenever you're ready.

81
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,840
Judge, please wait; we don't need to start the session.

82
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,639
The plaintiff, Mr. Fu Yancheng, and I have been married for three years.

83
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,200
We've never met.

84
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,840
That is sufficient proof that we have no emotional attachments.

85
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,000
I respectfully request the judge to grant us a divorce.

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,739
It's not like that.

87
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,000
Judge, I would like to withdraw the lawsuit.

88
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I don't want a divorce anymore.

89
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
Since the plaintiff has verbally applied to withdraw the lawsuit,

90
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,519
the court is now in recess.

91
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:30,800
♫  After all, there are too many beautiful memories  ♫ 
 ♫  The world is upside down  ♫

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:37,130
♫  There is nothing worse than now  ♫

93

♫  I can't control our huge distance well  ♫

95
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,200
♫  My thoughts have left me nowhere to run  ♫

96
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,160
♫  I can't forget you  ♫ 
 ♫  It's futile to worry about you  ♫

97
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,150
♫  You shake me when you appear  ♫

98
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,080
Since you've always wanted a divorce,

99
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,480
let's not waste each other's time.

100
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,059
If I had known you were Sheng Mian,

101
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,320
I would never have agreed to divorce you.

102
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,360
♫  I never had it for a second  ♫

103
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:21,030
♫  I actually still enjoy the unbearable torment  ♫

104
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,879
Fu Yancheng,

105
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,440
if you had cared about Sheng Mian at all,

106
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,479
you wouldn't have discovered my identity so late.

107
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,919
Sheng Mian,

108
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,100
let me explain.

109
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,920
Three years ago,

110
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,080
my grandfather forced me to marry a woman I didn't know.

111
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,599
I thought he had been deceived by a scheming woman.

112
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:50,439
My indifference toward you was merely a way to resist this unequal, arranged marriage.

113
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,639
Sheng Mian.

114
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,360
Don't touch me!

115
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,080
You labeled me as vain and materialistic without even meeting me.

116
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,919
It's been three years.

117
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,120
My position as Mrs. Fu, which exists in name only,

118
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,719
has long been a joke in the eyes of others.

119
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,440
It's me. It's all my fault.

120
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,799
I don't know what I can say to earn your forgiveness now,

121
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,399
but we have our baby.

122
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,080
Baby?

123
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't mention the child!

124
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,879
Didn't you say this?

125
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,839
The children of the Fu family will never carry the blood of the Sheng family?

126
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,639
As you wish,

127
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,080
now the baby is gone.

128
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,260
There's no future for us.

129
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Sorry. I'm so sorry, Sheng Mian.

130
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,399
If I could've made it to the hospital,

131
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,120
our baby...

132
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,919
Why didn't you tell me sooner that you were Sheng Mian?

133
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,939
Don't you remember?

134
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,799
From the first time we met... you called me to say you wanted a divorce.

135
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,320
For three years,

136
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,840
you haven't hidden your disgust for Sheng Mian at all.

137
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,960
How could I have told you?

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,039
Stop, please, Sheng Mian.

139
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,879
Yes.

140
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,679
I'm a complete jerk.

141
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,559
I'm so sorry.

142
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,640
I gave you a marriage, but I never took the time to understand you.

143
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,500
You may not have noticed it. But I regret it now.

144
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,799
In all my life, I never owed anyone except for you.

145
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,920
I owe you too much.

146
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,839
Fu Yancheng.

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Let's get a divorce.
