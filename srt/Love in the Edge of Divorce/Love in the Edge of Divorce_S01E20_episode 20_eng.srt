2
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,680
   

3
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,360
   

4
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,600
Grandfather, why are you leaving?

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,159
So, does that mean you agree?

6
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,780
I agree!

7
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,699
Did you hear that? Grandfather has agreed.

8
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,000
Can you please let me know about these things in advance next time?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,759
I don't like surprises like this.

10
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,840
Are you upset?

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,380
I just wanted Grandfather to know that you're a good woman.

12
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,959
But our current relationship isn't presentable before family members.

13
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,280
I'll get the divorce done tomorrow.

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,019
Wait for me.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,139
 Dad. 

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,300
 Tomorrow, I'll be divorcing Fu Yancheng. 

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,239
 Maybe this is the best ending for us. 

18
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,680
 If only you were by my side right now. 

19
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,339
 Dad, 

20
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,580
 I miss you so much. 

21
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,039
 Time passes so fast. 

22
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,039
 In the blink of an eye, you've grown so much. 

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,339
 I really wish Dad could stay with you longer. 

24
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,280
 He just fell into a coma. 

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,879
 That old devil actually left all his property to that little wretch Sheng Mian. 

26
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,279
 We need to make plans earlier. 

27
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,319
 Don't worry. I'm here. 

28
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,719
 After Sheng Zhong dies, 

29
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,319
 we don't have to keep our affair a secret anymore. 

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,680
 I see. 

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,759
 No wonder Su Lan was able to easily transfer company funds. 

32
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,339
 So, they've been conspiring for a long time. 

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,320
 I bequeath all my shares in Sheng Group and all my assets 

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,019
 to my youngest daughter, Sheng Weiyuan. 

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,519
 The will must have issues as well. 

36
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,599
Grandfather, I didn't mean to hide it from Yancheng.

37
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,539
Mian Mian, you're a good kid.

38
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,719
I know you must have your reasons for doing this.

39
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,439
I'll keep this secret for you.

40
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,399
When you're ready to tell him, you can tell him yourself.

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,039
Grandfather, I came today to ask for your help with something.

42
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,139
What is it?

43
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,639
It's about my family.

44
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,120
Previously, Fu Group gave Sheng Group two rounds of financing.

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,960
Logically, there shouldn't have been any issues with the cash flow.

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,199
But during my father's critical illness,

47
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,960
the company's accounts were completely emptied.

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,400
I suspect something is wrong.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,219
Fu Group and Sheng Group have close financial ties,

50
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:01,480
so I wonder if it could be investigated through Fu Group's records.

51
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,139
Also...

52
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,879
I suspect my father's will has issues, too.

53
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,439
Do you have any suspects?

54
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,360
It's likely Su Lan, but this is just a guess.

55
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,419
To expose her, I need solid evidence.

56
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,820
So, I want to ask for your help.

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,240
Mian Mian, I can help with other things, but I'm old.

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,920
I struggle with reading through account books.

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,619
I really can't do much here.

60
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,499
I didn't think this through clearly, Grandfather.

61
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:42,079
However, I do know someone who can help you.

62
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm not sure if you'd agree...

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,199
Of course, if you recommend them, I'd be more than willing!

64
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,900
All right, I'll talk to Yancheng about it and have him look into it for you.

65
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,919
Grandfather!

66
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,200
Look at you!

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,120
Didn't you just say you'd be completely willing to go with my recommendation?

68
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,360
Currently, the person most familiar with Fu and Sheng Groups

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,319
and has the most connections, is that guy.

70
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,160
If you refuse, don't blame me for not helping you.

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Butâ€¦

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,619
Mian Mian, don't divorce Yancheng for now.

73
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:19,020
Having the status of Mrs. Fu will make your investigation easier.

74
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,720
Once your father's matters are settled,

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,800
whether you divorce or not is up to you.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,600
I promise not to interfere with your decision again.

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,520
Is that okay?

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,540
All right, Grandfather. I'll take my leave now.

79
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,959
Good move.

80
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,639
Grandfather, did Sheng Mian visit again?

81
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,619
She agreed to file the divorce today, but changed her mind again.

82
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:00,680
Yes. Sheng Mian was just here.

83
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,519
There she goes again.

84
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,240
But Mian Mian said that a forced relationship doesn't bear sweet fruit.

85
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,859
She'll definitely divorce you,

86
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:15,080
but before that, she needs your help.

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,339
Something has happened to her family.

88
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,920
Again?

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,279
Tell me, Grandfather.

90
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,599
What happened to her family this time?

91
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:29,519
Her stepmother likely colluded with outsiders to transfer funds.

92
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,539
You should investigate and find out what's going on.

93
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,160
Also, once you solve this matter,

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,420
I promise you can marry Penny.

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you serious?

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,759
Of course, but you must first help Sheng Mian uncover the truth.

97
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,120
Fine, I'll start investigating immediately.

98
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,079
Hey, wait a minute.

99
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,719
Keep this matter low-key and handle it yourself.

100
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,959
Since you and Penny are in love, have her join you.

101
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, I understand.

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,519
I refuse to believe that after all this,

103
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,020
Sheng Mian will still agree to divorce him.

104
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,320
    
    

105
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
- When is our meeting with the client? 
 - At 3:00 p.m.

106
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,579
There's still an hour left. Plenty of time.

107
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,600
President Fu.

108
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,619
What a coincidence!

109
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,379
Such a small world.

110
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,839
Director Liang.

111
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,920
When did you switch careers to cleaning?

112
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,199
President Fu, such a coincidence.

113
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,399
I'm here to work on the renovations for this hotel.

114
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,860
Just surveying the area.

115
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,519
Did you really think splotching your face like that would make you unrecognizable?

116
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,199
Liang Hanqing.

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,859
Are you still going to continue hiding the truth?

118
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:31,160
What's really going on between you and Penny?

119
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,560
This is so tough for me.

120
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,360
I can't afford to offend either side.

121
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,759
No matter what, I'm doomed.

122
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,659
Fine, I'll tell you the truth, President Fu.

123
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:42,200
Penny and I... the two of us are a fake couple.

124
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,379
I meant no harm in lying to you, really!

125
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,559
Say that again.

126
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,759
I said we meant no harm in lying to you.

127
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,519
- The sentence before that. 
 - The sentence before that?

128
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,479
Penny and I are a fake couple.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,120
I knew it.  Penny has better taste than that.

130
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,859
Exactly, exactly... What?

131
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,240
Here's a gift for you.

132
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,520
The password is Penny's birthday.

133
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,000
Rich people sure know how to insult others.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,119
But I like it.

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,639
Don't tell Penny we met today.

136
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,120
If she finds out, I wouldn't mind making the studio disappear.

137
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,060
Don't worry, President Fu. I definitely won't.

138
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,159
That guy is so strange.

139
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,619
No wonder Penny doesn't like him.

140
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,320
Why has so much money been funneled to this company?

141
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,199
Why did Dad never mention it to me?

142
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,619
Are you hiding something from me?

143
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,900
 Oh, no! 

144
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,240
 Grandpa must've slipped and told Fu Yancheng. 

145
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,340
 What do I do now? 

146
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,630
 "The Page You Appeared On" - Joynam 

147
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:33,400
â™«  Crossing the border of rain, 
 I came to the sunny day you walked through  â™«

148
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:40,810
â™«  A moment of light brings to mind your gentle prophecy  â™«

149
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:48,340
â™«  You will defeat everything and rush to my side  â™«

150
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:55,040
â™«  Like a fairy tale world with a happy plot forever  â™«

151
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,630
â™«  When the beautiful things disappear and disillusionment breaks down, 
 when the world can't fall asleep  â™«

152
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:10,320
â™«  You will remember the accidental encounter, 
 but it's a pity that the two of us go our separate ways  â™«

153
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,130
â™«  I wandered around and broke into the page where you appeared  â™«

154
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,910
â™«  At the edge of the seaside forest, like the wind wandering past  â™«

155
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,720
â™«  Half of the moonlight lit up the other half of the world  â™«

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,330
â™«  Maybe on a day that you and I didn't get there  â™«

157
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,360
â™«  I unknowingly walked past the page where you appeared  â™«

158
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,140
â™«  Letting half of the fairy tale disappear before writing forever  â™«

159
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:41,600
â™«  What I thought was eternal and unchanging was only half the story  â™«
