I wish you had returned it a little more stealthily.

00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,731
Stealthily?

00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:02,736
You know, we don't want people to get any ideas.

[Episode 4]
You know Ochi-san from Kobe Confectionary?

27
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:36,311
She specifically wants to meet Togawa-kun again.

28
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,693
Okay, but that's not even work-related.

29
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,284
You better come. Boss's order.

30
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:45,060
- Really?
- That's power harassment.

31
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:48,313
Isn't it fine? Come on, she's pretty.

32
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:50,422
That's not the problem.

33
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,147
You're so annoying.

34
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:57,629
Hey, maybe you're okay with being single for the rest of your life,

35
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,990
but Togawa-kun might want a life partner.

36
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:03,404
Right?

37
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,990
No, that's not—

Shut up!

Creating opportunities for love is a boss's responsibility, too.

But...

47
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:40,638
It might even go well, and you'd go home with her.

48

Either way... I'm not letting him go.

All right.

You're the star today, so act cordial.

79
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,384
I told you, stop with that noh mask.

80
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:04,784
"Noh mask"?

81
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:08,388
You know, that Japanese white mask with the blank face.

82
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,535
You look exactly like that.

83
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:13,505

Togawa-san, do you remember me?

Of course, Ochi-san.

- Really?
- Really?

92
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,730
It’s delicious, especially the mustard.

93
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,740
Again. Here you go, again.

94
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,353
Want some salad, Nozue-san?

95
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:44,940
What? No, I'm fine.

96
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,790
For example…

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,510
Your hobbies?

98
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,460
I’m little jealous.

99
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,380
But today…

100
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,870
And enjoy the food.

101
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:04,563
Togawa-san, you're like a hamster.

He always stuffs his face, even with ramen or ice cream.

That's so cute!

- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

105
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,709
Stay sharp, Togawa.

106
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:24,467
Nozue-san, how old are you?

107
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,636
Sorry, that was rude.

108
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,489
I thought maybe we're the same age.

109
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:31,036
No, I'm turning 40 this year.

110
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,927
No way, you don't look that age.

111
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:34,745
You look so young.

112
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,500
Thanks, even if you're just being nice.

113
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,405
There's his sinful smile.

114

115
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,991
Oh, thank you.

116

I'm turning 30 this year,

117
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,528
but when I see someone youthful like you,

118
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,520
it makes me want to try harder.

119
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:55,762
Thanks.

120
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:59,769
Hearing you say that makes me want to try harder, too.

121
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:03,197
Oh, do you do any sports?

122
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:05,595
No, I don't do any sports,

123
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,205
but I do an anti-aging routine.

124
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:11,464
Well, more like someone does it for me.

125
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:14,214
That's deep. Does that mean you're in love?

126
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:16,272
If I were, I wouldn't be here.

127
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:17,730
That's true.

128
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:22,135
Would you like to go to the gym together then?

129
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:24,584
Oh, that might be nice.

130
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,683
Let's trade phone numbers, then.

131
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:28,138
Of course.

Um, how do I do this again?

133
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,753
Let me see that.

134
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,013
- Okay, done.
- Thanks.

135
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:38,729
Thanks.

136
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:42,567
Togawa-san, what do you do on your days off?

137
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,600
I…

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,211
Excuse me, another beer.

139
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,760
Togawa-san, don't push yourself. Are you okay there?

140
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
You mean… hey, hey!

141
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:12,696
Why do I have to nurse you in the end?

142
00:09:15,184 --> 00:09:18,577
Would you rather be with that pretty girl?

143
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:22,133
Is that what you want?

144
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,997
Sorry, I'm not a girl.

145
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,585
This is exactly as I planned.

146
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:33,492
It looked like a girl was going to take you home,

147
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,930
so I provided you with some help.

148
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,194
Don't be silly.

149
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,016
You're kind of like a kid.

150
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,777
Is it that pretty girl from earlier?

151
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:08,073
Yeah, she said thank you.

152
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:12,499
Nice, Nozue-san.

153
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:15,214
She's just being polite.

154
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:21,086
That's what you prefer more, right?

155
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:31,430
You want a girl who is into tasty desserts and the zoo.

156
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:38,000
Being with a guy like me is a bother, right?

157
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm sorry, really.

158
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:46,925
- But I…
- What are you saying?

159
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,343
You're not a bother.

160
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,725
She said I looked young just to be nice,

161
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,310
and I was happy like an idiot.

162
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,341
I think it's thanks to your anti-aging method,

163
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:06,298
and most importantly, it's fun being with you.

164
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,726
Nozue-san.

165
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,842
Never mind.

166
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:43,063
You drunkard.

167
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,055
Good morning.

00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,079
Are you hung over?

169
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,663
So you remember.

170
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:11,977
Sorry, I made you sleep on the sofa.

171
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:15,593
No, I'm sorry for staying over without asking.

172
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:18,772
I was tired after I carried you over.

173
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:24,071
And you wanted to take that girl home, not me, right?

174
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:26,871
Sorry for getting in the way.

175
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,460
Girl?

176
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,815
Oh, the pretty one you exchanged numbers with.

177
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:33,913
Oh, that girl.

178
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:36,361
It's not like I didn't consider it.

179
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:40,850
But as a boss, I can't abandon a drunk worker of mine.

180
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,938
I truly apologize.

181
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:48,543
No, more importantly, you have a nice body.

182
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:49,972
What?

183
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,045
Do you work out?

184
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,960
I do.

185
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,239
Three times a week.

186
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:01,757
Wow, that's amazing.

187
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,158
Um...

188
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:08,158
It's a bit late, but nothing happened, right?

189
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,558
What?

190
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:11,194
Um, I mean...

191
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,047
Oh, nothing happened.

192
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:16,393
The girls wanted me to take you home.

193
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,624
No, not that.

194
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:20,065
What?

195
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,642
It's nothing. I'll make some coffee.

196
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:52,031
Have some.

197
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,707
Hey, do you have any fitness equipment?

198
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:58,760
You can train your muscles without them. Let's try it together.

199
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,943
Hm, I'm not sure.

200
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:06,567
Oh, sorry, you're going to the gym with that girl, right?

201
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:10,287
No, that was just me being polite.

202
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,622
Are you sure?

203
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:15,417
- Then…
- And I'm bad at exercise.

204
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:19,416
That's exactly the kind of person who should do muscle training.

205
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,590
Your immunity will go up.

206
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,140
You've gotten sick a lot lately.

207
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,398
This is for anti-aging, too.

208
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,571
I see.

209
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:32,671
I'll teach you some easy exercises, so start today.

210
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,865
Let's get you the muscles you need for living.

211
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,658
I've already lived 40 years. I'm fine.

212
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:40,677
You're not fine.

213
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,079
When push comes to shove, you'll have to run and escape,

214
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,754
grab emergency supplies, or save someone important.

215
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:50,100
Or carry a drunk worker home.

216
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:53,585
I'm really sorry.

217
00:14:56,914 --> 00:15:02,516
And you need stamina for sex, too.

218
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:07,633
Stop with the dirty jokes.

219
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,399
I'm being serious.

220
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,868
You'd usually start with dynamic stretching,

221
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,269
but let's start with planks.

222
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:20,858
What? Right now?

223
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:27,371
Wait, seriously, I can't do this anymore.

224
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:30,007
We haven't done anything yet.

225
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,575
Can you straighten your body more?

226
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:35,105
Wait, I don't know.

227
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:39,032
Seriously, I can't do this. I might die.

228
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:42,027
- Raise your belly and butt a bit more.
- Wait.

229
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:43,300
Wait, what?

230
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,199
Can't I just raise my butt?

231
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,107
If you raise your butt, your belly will follow.

232
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:52,535
Wait, my butt... That's too much.

233
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,205
Togawa.

234
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:57,534
You really have no muscles.

235
00:15:57,534 --> 00:16:02,416
No, I lost my strength since you keep touching me in weird places.

236
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,691
How is it weird?

237
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:08,758
Wait, hold on.

238
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:11,665
You're tickling me. What?

239
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:13,418
Togawa.

240
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:27,085
If you feel muscle pain, don't push yourself.

241
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:32,196
They say that pain is from the muscle trying to repair itself.

242
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:38,596
Is there a point to cleaning now?

243
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:42,968
Even when the pain goes down, you don't have to exercise every day.

244
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,969
You're a muscle expert.

245
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:48,510
What sports do you do?

246
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,758
I sometimes do Kendo.

247
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:53,327
I did it in high school.

248
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:56,130
Wow, that's cool.

249
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,600
I go rock climbing too.

250
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,133
And mountain climbing.

251
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,754
Not big ones, though.

252
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:06,627
And I do golf and futsal too.

253
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:10,607
You sure do a lot.

254
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,963
You're not like me at all.

255
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,133
It's all thanks to you

256
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:21,516
that I'm doing all this and enjoying every day.

257
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:23,562
What?

258
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:28,652
You taught me this on the first day we met.

259
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:34,354
Thank you for today.

260
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,220
It's fine, I dragged you here.

261
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,910
Are there any taxis?

262
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,660
I'll do my best.

263
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,983
I'll work hard.

264
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,196
You don't have to strain yourself.

265
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,407
But...

266
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:52,961
I told you earlier.

267
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,715
Regret can fuel your life.

268
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:58,596
- Right, so I'll work hard—
- But...

269
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,261
life isn't just about work.

270
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,490
There's hanging out with friends, hobbies, and romance.

271
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,760
Those aren't for me.

272
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,763
Really?

273
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,610
Aren't you just trying not to get your hopes up?

274
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:32,018
It's okay, you'll learn to love yourself more.

275
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,768
You told me I'd learn to love myself more.

276
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:49,657
So I tried lots of new things

277
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:53,076
and tried to enjoy doing more things.

278
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,993
Now I like myself one hundred times more than back then.

279
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:04,583
That was all you. I didn't do anything.

280
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:11,142
And you taught me a lot outside of work as well.

281
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:18,536
Learning to forgive others and put myself in their shoes.

282
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:20,646
A simple smile.

283
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:24,229
Ordinary happiness.

284
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:27,115
Doing things on my days off.

285
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,325
After becoming an adult,

286
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:33,590
it was only you who taught me

287
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,010
and reminded me of those things.

288
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,688
Nozue-san?

289
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,880
I...

290
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,345
I feel that way too.

291
00:19:57,345 --> 00:20:03,504
You're the only one who makes me glad that I've lived.

292
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,415
Nozue-san.

293
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:13,479
[Ochi-san]

294
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,636
I'll get going then.

295
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:23,682
What?

296
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,930
You have a call waiting.

297
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,906
No, she's just being polite.

298
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,468
Really?

299
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:31,715
- Um...
- See you.

300
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,949
- I need to go take a bath.
- Use my shower.

301
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,591
I need more sleep. I have to watch the show I recorded.

302
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:41,695
- I need to meal prep for the week.
- Nozue-san.

303
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:44,679
I'm expecting a package and have to work on my garden.

304
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,669
Nozue-san.

305
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,450
And then I have to do that thing.

306
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,253
Nozue-san.

307
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,411
Togawa, what are you doing?

308
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:05,893
Are you drunk?

309
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:07,541
I'm not drunk.

310
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:16,094
I'm not hungover either. I'm not half asleep.

311
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,268
Wait, hold on, Togawa.

312
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,468
Togawa.

313
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,790
I'm seducing you.

314
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:33,541
I've been trying to seduce you.

315
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:37,274
With everything I have.

316
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:41,496
Although you never had a clue.

317
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,900
I know.

318
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,583
Being seduced by the same sex

319
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,743
isn't considered common sense for most people.

320
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,494
Especially from a subordinate.

321
00:21:58,488 --> 00:22:01,827
But unfortunately, it's common sense to me.

322
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,977
So I've been seducing you.

323
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,260
Togawa.

324
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:13,765
I've been meaning to tell you this whole time,

325
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:17,018
but I was afraid.

326
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,680
I was scared of saying something that wasn't normal to you.

327
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:28,493
But doing this...

328
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:32,784
and telling you in such a horrible way...

329
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,455
I'm so sorry.

330
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:42,179
I like you.

331
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:48,078
I like you so much, I could die.

332
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:50,902
Togawa.

333
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,971
It's fine. I know.

334
00:22:57,935 --> 00:22:59,543
However...

335
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:06,149
I was so happy when you said that about me.

336
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,171
It made me so happy.

337
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:14,292
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:20,227
I couldn't hold it in anymore.

339
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,206
I'm really sorry.

340
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,949
Please hit me.

341
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:33,353
I wouldn't do that.

342
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:35,299
Please hit me!

343
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:39,049
I told you, I wouldn't...

344
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:50,061
Togawa.

345
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:11,877
[Preview]
I'm almost 40, and he's almost 30.

346
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:14,539
I'm a guy, and he's a guy.

347
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:17,755
I'm his boss, and he is my subordinate.

348
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:21,135
Please, let's keep being a normal boss and worker.

349
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,464
We'll forget with time.

350
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,297
- Hey—
- I'll go back then.

351
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:31,980
I was scared about what would happen after saying I love you.

352
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,575
If I go back to my passive self,

353
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:38,300
Togawa will never smile for me again.
