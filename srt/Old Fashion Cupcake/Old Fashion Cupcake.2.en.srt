Did you know?

72
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,552
The reason why a year feels so fast to adults like us

73
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:46,160
is because every day is the same.

74
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
I see.

75
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,090
Children experience something new every day,

76
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:58,410
so every day is fresh and memorable, making a year feel longer.

77
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,030
I see.

78
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,886
And getting stuck in a daily pattern is also said to cause dementia.

79
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,790
That means new experiences are more important as you grow older.

168
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,970
Could it be you're actually sucking up to me?

169
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,590
What are you saying?

170
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,680
That would make me a bit sad.

171
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,360
Since I really enjoy hanging out with you, Togawa.

172
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,500
Is that so?

173
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,210
Yeah.

174
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,250
I'm glad to hear it.

175
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,610
Will it take a while?

176
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,090
Oh, it'll be about twenty minutes. What do you think?

177
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,420
It's cold. Should we go somewhere else?

178
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,480
Twenty minutes will go by quickly.

179
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,730
You found this place for us, right?

180
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,500
Let's stay.

181
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,030
Here.

182
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,380
Thanks.

183
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,480
I heard the chocolate parfait is great.

184
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,600
But parfaits in this cold was a bad choice, huh?

185
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,090
Should we go eat something warm?

186
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,196
What is it?

187
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:39,686
Well, I was just thinking it's impossible for you to be sucking up to me.

188
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll just be happy that you like me as your boss.

189
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,356
Then you're paying today.

190
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:54,556
What?

191
00:13:54,556 --> 00:13:57,426
It's really pretty.

192
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,340
Why are you taking it from above?

193
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,756
Isn't it cute?

194
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:06,179
Thank you for waiting. Here's the chocolate parfait.

195
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,216
- Me.
- Okay.

196
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:10,240
Here, please.

197
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,916
This is the strawberry parfait.

198
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,650
- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.

199
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:22,316
Here goes.

200
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:34,140
- Is it good?
- Yeah, it's delicious.

201
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:40,416
Here, I'll take your photo.

202
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,506
Oh, then about how about…

203
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:45,126
Excuse me.

204
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:49,446
- Could you take our photo?
- Sure.

205
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:55,661
Get ready for the photo.

206
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,368
Say, "Cheese."

207
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,428
- One more, please.
- Okay.

208
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,488
- Ready?
- Yes.

209
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,968
Say, "Cheese."

210
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:09,488
Thank you.

211
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,758
Is this okay?

212
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:14,058
Yes, thank you.

213
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:16,288
Geez.

214
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:21,078
- Nozue-san.
- Yeah.

215
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:23,678
Where should we go next week?

216
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:27,218
What do you like the most?

217
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,658
Oh, didn't I tell you?

218
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:31,063
- Do you like waffles?
- Yes.

219
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,874
It's on your lips.

220
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:37,228
- Time to eat.
- Yes.

221
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:39,872
- Nice.
- That's good.

222
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,559
Yeah, it's good.

223
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,772
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

224

♫ I don't even know myself yet ♫

225
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,068
- Wow, this is good.
- Yeah.

226
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:52,162
Okay, "cheese".

227
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:57,592
You're always taking too many photos.

228
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,462
Wow.

229
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,490
- That's good.
- Yeah, it's sweet.

230
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,592
And you drink it like this?

231
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,650
Now I see, it's just right.

232
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,820
- The flavors work.
- Yeah.

233
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,810

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,930
Good morning.

237
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:27,462
- Morning.
- Good morning.

238
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,262
Morning.

239
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,562
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

240
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,592
It's rare seeing that vest.

241
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:42,572
- It's nice on occasion.
- It's cool.

242
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,040
Yeah.

243
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,992
Nozue-san, you seem lively lately.

244
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:49,962
- Do you have any good news?
- What?

245
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:52,922
Don't tell me... did you get a girlfriend?

246
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:55,219
No, something even better.

247
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:56,919
Better?

248
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,279
- Are you getting married?
- No way.

249
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,870
Did you go to one of those Kitty Cat Puff Puff places

250
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,709
and have them do... Ouch!

251
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,289
You have a meeting soon, right?

252
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,409
Oh, I forgot! Crap!

253
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,129
- I'll be off.
- Good luck.

254
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,009
Don't throw things at your co-workers.

255
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,529
Okay.

256
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:27,529
You two are quite close lately.

257
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,239
Really? Is it weird?

258
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,709
- No, we think it's cute.
- That's right.

259
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,259
Cute? Is that really a good thing?

260
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,830
- Yes, it's a good thing.
- Really?

261
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,450
I bought a new suit.

263
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,480
Nozue-san's new suit is so cute.

264
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,089
It looks tasty. Got a date tonight?

265
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,549
No, it's for lunch.

266
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,550
He is too cute.

267
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,339
Oh right, Kono-san, Sasaki-san, would you like to go to lunch with me today?

268
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:03,689
Of course, I'd love to!

269
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:06,339
Are you two not having lunch together today?

270
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:09,169
We're not always together.

271
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,709
It's White Day. Let's go somewhere nice.

272
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,899
Invite your friends too if you'd like.

273
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:17,009
Okay! Thank you!

274
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:20,109
- See you.
- I can't believe it!

275
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,237
You look scary.

276
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:38,457
I'm getting some coffee.

277
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,180
Your boss is so cute.

278
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,280
What a good perfume.

279
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,990
- Sushi?
- Okay.

280
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,860
Today's lunch was kind of him

281
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,880
Let's go there another time, okay?

282
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,140
Yes!

283
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,700
A kind person.

284
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,010
Nozue-san is sure.

285
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,747
Did you have fun eating with those young girls?

286
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:15,497
You scared me.

287
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:17,907
Nothing for me on White Day, huh?

288
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,917
What?

289
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,747
It's nothing. Please confirm this.

290
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,917
That was quick. Thanks.

291
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:29,567
What did you talk about?

292
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,467
What?

293
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,777
Even the receptionists went with you.

294
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:36,597
The whole floor is talking about your harem lunch.

295
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:39,847
What? People can be so rude.

296
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:44,726
I was asking those girls about popular restaurants and places to go.

297
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,477
I felt bad that you were always the one to take me out.

298
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:53,117
I wanted to find out where to go next.

299
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:57,597
Well, I guess I didn't personally find it.

300
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:01,020
They shared a bunch, so I'll text you later.

301
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,470
Oh! Sorry!

302
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,490
Are you done with playing pretend?

303
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,237
I had fun, so maybe I jumped the gun—

304
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:11,337
Let's go.

305
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:13,637
You'll decide the next place.

306
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:18,067
All right, leave the next place to me.

307
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,977
Thank you.

308
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:24,324
- By the way…
- Yeah?

309
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:28,727
There's still some left from Takai-san's souvenir. Eat it up.

310
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,887
You liked it, right?

311
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,277
Yeah.

312
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,637
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

313
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:44,207
You were irritable all day this morning.

314
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:48,229
It's the payment issue from Nariyoshi Goods, right?

315
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:50,159
Did it work out?

316
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,424
Sorry, I got confirmation.

317
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:58,257
But that's not why I was…

318
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,127
Anyway, sorry for worrying you.

319
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:05,097
I see. As long as you're okay, that's fine.

320
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,377
I'm okay.

321
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,077
Good to know.

322
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,059
- Want some coffee?
- Oh, sure.

323
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:17,387
By the way,

324
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:23,977
the receptionists said you're hot, too.

325
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:25,467
Thank you.

326
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,027
That wasn't cute. Try again.

327
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:30,007
That's harassment.

328
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:33,967
Togawa-kun's so cute, isn't he? So hot.

329
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,747
Okay, now act shy and bashful.

330
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:37,247
What are you doing?

331
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:40,767
It's girl talk, so join in.

332
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,127
Join in?

00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:46,627
Hey, Togawa-kun, embrace me.

334
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:49,047
Give me a hug.

335
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,987
Sorry, did I go too far?

336
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:06,137
Hey, wait, what? What is this?

337
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,787
You asked me to hug you, right?

338
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,847
Yeah, I did say it, but…

339
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,757
If you're a girl, put your all into it.

340
00:22:14,757 --> 00:22:16,557
What?

341
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:23,467
A girl should give a cuter response when hugged by a hot guy.

342
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,657
Cute? Like what?

343
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:31,477
If you think about it, I'm just an old man.

344
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:35,797
Wow.

345
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:38,097
What do you mean, "Wow"?

346
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,037
No, it's all good.

347
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:45,487
That's good then.

348
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:48,687
This helps with anti-aging too.

349
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:51,037
I'm still in my thirties.

350
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:54,760
Nozue-san? Nozue-san!

351
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,000
♫ When something is about to start? ♫

352
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,320
Nozue-san, are you mad?

353
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,080
I'm not mad.

354
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,850
Nozue-san.

355
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,167
♫ Yeah to love somebody ♫

356
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,680
That three-piece suit looks good on you.

357
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,870
♫ I don't even know myself yet ♫

358
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,460
It's nice.

359
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,747
Thanks.

360
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:23,277
Next time, it's your turn for a new experience.

361
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,717
Okay.

362
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,820
♫ I've touched your hand ♫

363
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:37,770
♫ At that moment, who was reflected in my eyes ♫

364
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,800
♫ Was you ♫

365
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:44,636
[Preview]
Let's have some boy talk.

366
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,094
I get off by thinking about my crush.

367
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,821
Someone he likes.

368
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:53,195
You took me to all sorts of places, so I think my brain has stopped aging.

369
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:56,255
Nozue-san. Why are you avoiding me?

370
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:57,948
I'm just your boss at work.

371
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:01,028
I might've gotten too involved with your personal life.

372
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:05,115
You're not just my boss. You're very special to me.

373
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:10,230
♫ Our colors blur our days ♫

374
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,450
♫ You ♫
