1
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,879
Sleep, wake up, and go to work. That's what I do every day.

2
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:32,952
And that's all I do because I enjoy it.

3
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:04,369
If I do the same thing every day,

4
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:08,484
nothing good happens, but nothing bad happens either.

Center Morning! Here is our next segment.

7
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,357
It looks great and it tastes delicious!

8
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:47,839
- A curious collection of sweets.
- Time to eat.

9
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:53,599
Today, we'll visit a popular pancake house in Ebisu.

10
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:56,719
- The owner raises his own chickens.
- It looks good.

11
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,964
Their pancakes are always made with fresh eggs.

12
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:04,427
It seems more men are visiting lately, too.

13
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:06,442
Old men can't go alone.

14
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:09,577
I tried the pancakes as well.

29
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:16,482
Yes, okay. I understand.
[Episode 1]

30
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:19,227
I got it. Have a good day.

31
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,062
So...

32
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:28,447
The boat shipment will get there by 2 p.m.

33
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:37,147
I'm truly sorry, thank you for the help.

34
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:40,023
It's fine, feel free to rely on me.

35
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:41,017
What?

36
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,229
Bosses are only helpful in times like these.

37
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:47,649
Really, I'll carry you anywhere.

38
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:51,358
I could never, Nozue-san.
(T/N: San, honorific meaning Mr., Ms.)

39
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:56,369
And so, Nakamura-kun, can you help us come back from this?
(T/N: kun, honorific used to address men who are younger or the same age as the speaker)

40
00:03:57,565 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, of course.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,550
I'll be in your care.

42
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,020
Yes.

43
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,530
Good.

44
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,618
Nozue-san, good work today.

45
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:17,828
You too, Togawa.

46
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:20,747
Department Head Kirishima called.

47
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,667
She wants to talk with you.

48
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,198
Oh, I wonder why.

49
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:27,037
You never stopped by after work.

50
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:29,447
Oh, I forgot.

51
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,114
Please don't forget.

52
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:33,078
Sorry, but it's all okay.

53
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:35,927
It's never important if it's after work.

54
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,420
Based on the timing, maybe it's HR-related.

55
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:45,988
Okay, I'll go see her in person.

56
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,176
Nozue-san is so cute today.

57
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:01,327
Like every day.

58
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:04,478
I would do an hour of overtime if it's for him.

59
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,808
Thanks to him, we don't need to work overtime.

60
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,295
Yeah, he works so fast.

61
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:13,197
But why is he single? He's so popular.

62
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,571
Now that you mention it, Kanda-san, from accounting,

63
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:21,117
is following Nozue-san around again.

64
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:22,972
She's fine with being second.

65
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,472
What? She actually said that?

66
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:29,567
To that extent? What did Nozue-san do to her?

67
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,317
He hasn't done anything, of course.

68
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:36,013
Just seeing him laugh tickles our maternal instincts.

69
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,199
We're so sinful.

70
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:41,855
Everyone.

71
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,117
Don't make him work overtime.

72
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,497
- Sorry.
- Of course.

73
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,232
I'll get back to work.

74
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,040
Again.

75
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,067
And how about Togawa-san?

76
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,742
You know what?

77
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:16,757
You can't avoid this forever.

78
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:18,411
Yeah...

79
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,902
You're so talented.

80
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:25,717
But I'm not department head material, so...

81
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,335
Geez.

82
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:31,217
Just think about it, okay?

83
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:34,087
That wouldn't change much.

84
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:37,751
I pushed for them to promote you.

85
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:42,318
At least help me save face by thinking about it for half a day.

86
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,858
Fine, only because we started here at the same time.

87
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:50,467
Geez, you never seem to want anything.

88
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:55,897
Oh right, are you free tonight? Let's eat some sushi. What do you think?

89
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:58,501
Sure, are you paying?

90
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,051
No, it's a Goukon. Takitani wanted me to invite you.
(T/N: Goukon, small gathering where men and women can meet)

91
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:05,846
- I'm not going.
- Come on, just consider it.

92
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,408
Bye then.

93
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:10,120
Shouldn't you at least want girls?

94
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,940
That's sexual harassment.

95
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,667
Excuse me.

96
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,797
Oh, it's you, Togawa-san.

97
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:40,957
You can't smoke here.

98
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:43,747
I miss our smoking room.

99
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:45,885
How about you quit smoking?

100
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:47,485
It's too late.

101
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,871
- Could you?
- Sure.

102
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,948
This was at your desk.

103
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,122
Sorry, I guess I left it out.

104
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:04,197
What did Boss Kirishima want?

105
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:07,187
Oh, she invited me to a Goukon.

106
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,039
What? That's it?

107
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
Yeah.

108
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:22,257
- Do I smell that much?
- Oh, sorry.

109
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:29,217
Are you going to the Goukon?

110
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:33,001
No, I'm not that young anymore.

111
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,311
Aren't you still 39?

112
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,215
I'm already 39.

113
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:40,785
If you're already 39, I want you to get promoted.

114
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,758
You should be in Kirishima's position.

115
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:47,677
No, I'm fine with where I am now.

116
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:51,508
That kind of competition is a bother.

117
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:58,554
You used to be hungrier for this.

118
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,312
Was I?

119
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:05,747
You're still 39, so don't say things like that.

120
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,827
Now I'm getting scolded by a 29-year-old.

121
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:17,437
I enjoy working with you.

122
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,428
That's not why I'm saying this,

123
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,932
but I want you to enjoy work too.

124
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:33,847
Sorry for stepping out of line.

125
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,962
No, not at all.

126
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:38,297
Actually, thank you.

127
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:40,999
It's nothing.

128
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:49,277
Oh right, Togawa-san, do you know any good places for dessert?

129
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,415
I know a few.

130
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,119
Can you show me?

131
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,719
Oh, sure.

132
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,828
Okay, I'll leave that to you.

133
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:02,463
Great, okay.

134
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,111
- Hello.
- Sorry for barging in.

135
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:05,671
It's fine.

136
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,628
It's not much, but as a form of apology…

137
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:13,624
- Oh, please. That call earlier was enough.
- Not at all.

138
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:15,770
Thank you. Please sit.

139
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,073
- Thank you.
- Please.

140
00:10:18,856 --> 00:10:23,152
Nakamura is doing his best to make up for this. Please understand.

141
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:27,340
Of course. We plan to work with you for a long time.

142
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:29,163
Thank you.

143
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:33,101
Oh, right. I found a delicious shochu place recently.
(T/N: Shochu is distilled liquor)

144
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,093
Would you like to go together sometime?

145
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,193
Of course.

146
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:53,356
Came out for a smoke?

147
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,241
But you can't smoke here.

148
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,691
Right. Thanks.

149
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,959
Why don't you quit?

150
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:09,080
I heard that exercise helps alleviate nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

151
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,440
We could go to the gym together.

152
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,443
Are you listening?

153
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,451
It must be nice to be a couple of girls.

154
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:20,872
What?

155
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:24,221
See? Looks fun, right?

156
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,401
But a couple of guys can have fun too.

157
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,778
Guys, no matter how excited they are,

158
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:35,676
never become that happy.

159
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,471
Well, I guess so.

160
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:44,429
They take photos, wait in line for pancakes, and talk about love…

161
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,791
They laugh at silly girl talk

162
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,451
and have pure fun.

163
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:54,211
Are you jealous?

164
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,031
I am.

165
00:11:56,032 --> 00:12:00,072
I mean, ever since we were young, we were never that lively.

166
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:02,985
Well then.

167
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,271
Let's take a lively photo.

168
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,111
No, that's not…

169
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,733
You're right.

170
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:19,815
But if I were a girl, I might've talked to you about love

171
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:22,396
and taken lively photos with you.

172
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:27,661
You're kind, so you'd play along, right?

173
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,701
Say cheese.

174
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,111
What are you doing?

175
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,865
Your pixel count is out of date.

176
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:54,552
I tried acting like a girl, taking a hot guy's photo.

177
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,098
Am I hot?

178
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,600
The girls in the office said it.

179
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:03,721
Those girls, huh?

180
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:10,171
Oh right, how long is half a day?

181
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,259
- Half a day?
- Yeah.

182
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,991
Twelve hours, I guess.

183
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:19,121
Or I guess, if you're only counting the hours we're awake,

184
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,211
it's six or eight hours.

185
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:22,993
That long?

186
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:27,151
Whatever, I'll be right back.

187
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:36,236
Hello, Kirishima?

188
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:39,151
Yeah, it's a bit early,

189
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:43,626
but after a lot of thinking, I'll have to turn down the promotion.

190
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:48,688
There are lots of more talented people.

191
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:52,711
No, I don't know what I'd be able to do,

192
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:56,261
and I don't even know what I want to do.

193
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,711
I…

194
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,920
I haven't accomplished anything until now.

195
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,257
So I don't know what I'd be able to do,

196
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:12,866
and I don't even know what I want to do.

197
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,658
That's not a good reason.

198
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,428
But what more can I say?

199
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:22,880
- You're like this every time…
- Hello?

200
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,004
- Keep this up and you'll never…
- Hello? Hmm, maybe it's my flip phone.

201
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:27,174
The reception…

202
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:30,849
- Hello?
- Hello? Wait, what?

203
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,800
Flip phones are convenient.

204
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,765
All right, let's head back.

205
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,760
Nozue-san.

206
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,695
Yeah?

207
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,635
Would you like to play pretend as a girl?

208
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:50,792
Play pretend? What do you mean?

209
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,292
Let's go.

210
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:57,685
Wait. Where are we going? Togawa.

211
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,000
Thank you for waiting.

212
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,260
Thank you, this looks delicious.

213
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:20,322
Are you not eating?

214
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:21,878
I mean, this is…

215
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,201
It's a strawberry pancake.

216
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:26,671
No, I mean we stick out here.

217
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:29,009
We're in the middle of playing pretend.

218
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,846
Forget that you're a man.

219
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,646
But…

220
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:35,483
You're the one who said you wanted to be a girl.

221
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,953
I didn't mean this.

222
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:43,743
It's okay, those girls are just head over heels for your devilish charm.

223
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,808
No, they're not. They're staring at you, a hot guy.

224
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:49,833
Stop that. Eat before it gets cold.

225
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,426
Do you have someone you like, Nozue-san?

226
00:15:57,426 --> 00:16:00,361
- Why so suddenly?
- It's girl talk.

227
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,351
“Girl talk"?

228
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:04,951
Do you like anyone?

229
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,818
I'm almost forty. I'm over the hill.

230
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:11,501
It's too late for love.

231
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:15,896
- You're scared, aren't you?
- What?

232
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,443
You're afraid of dating,

233
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:22,821
receiving new work from your promotion, getting more responsibilities…

234
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:25,880
Even eating pancakes here is scary.

235
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:31,844
You realized at this age that you've only worked your whole life,

236
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:35,721
but you don't know what to do or what you want to do.

237
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:40,131
Now that you're older, you're afraid you can't just say you don't know.

238
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:43,626
You're afraid of challenging the unknown and failing.

239
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:47,151
You're afraid of your 30s just ending like that.

240
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:51,191
You even regret that you've put all your passion into your work—

241
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,336
Togawa.

242
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:08,365
Yes?

243
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,318
I'm staying calm because it's you.

244
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,811
Say that to anyone else, and they'll hit you for sure.

245
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:17,311
I would only say this to you.

246
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:22,378
Also, I said that I was fully ready to get hit.

247
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:25,956
An out-of-shape guy in his 40s hitting a fit guy in his 30s?

248
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:28,255
Only my hand would get hurt.

249
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,360
Sorry for stepping out of line again.

250
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,011
Why bother even saying it, then?

251
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:37,063
Sorry.

252
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,471
Was I that obvious?

253
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:44,696
That right before going over the hill,

254
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:48,871
I was having an embarrassing midlife crisis?

255
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:52,351
It's not that. I'm the only one who noticed.

256
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,571
You're always the perfect boss.

257
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:57,291
Why couldn't I fool you?

258
00:17:57,896 --> 00:18:00,478
- Because I like you.
- What?

259
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:05,366
I like working with you.

260
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:10,795
Oh, I see. Thanks.

261
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,821
I learned everything by watching you, day in, day out.

262
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:20,991
That's why I've grown into be such an outstanding subordinate.

263
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:23,628
Are you complimenting yourself?

264
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,924
I've watched you at all hours,

265
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:29,921
so I was even able to see the early symptoms of your menopause.

266
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:34,138
Wait, I have menopause? Isn't it a bit soon?

267
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:37,361
True, you're still 39.

268
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:39,711
It's still too soon even at 40.

269
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:43,141
Basically, you're still young.

270
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,000
I have my doubts.

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,338
Regret can lead to happiness and can be a fuel to your life.

272
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:52,364
Oh, I've heard those words before.

273
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,028
- I learned them.
- From whom?

274
00:18:55,028 --> 00:19:00,054
I want to help you so you can burn that fuel and become happy.

275
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:03,091
I'm just your boss at work.

276
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:10,898
Would you like more coffee?

277
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,010
I'm good, thank you.

278
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,940
- Yes, please.
- Here.

279
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:22,831
Anyway, before your menopause gets worse,

280
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,736
let's think of countermeasures.

281
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:27,328
Are you talking about anti-aging?

282
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:28,728
Yes.

283
00:19:28,728 --> 00:19:34,024
First, consume your fuel and temporarily increase your serotonin.

284
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:37,851
- Go ahead.
- Okay, I got it.

285
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:56,361
How is the taste of regret?

286
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:59,851
It's 100 times tastier than I thought.

287
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,281
Glad to hear it.

288
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:05,321
Yeah, that's good.

289
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:22,525
Togawa-kun.

290
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,890
Yes?

291
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:26,121
Thanks.

292
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,960
No problem.

293
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,788
- Let's take a photo.
- What? But…

294
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,565
When you play pretend as a girl,

295
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:38,658
this is important for anti-aging.

296
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:40,812
So photos are mandatory.

297
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:42,249
Here it goes.

298
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:44,721
With the pancake.

299
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,381
Was I in the picture?

300
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:55,683
Please finish it in five minutes. We'll miss the meeting.

301
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:58,531
Five minutes? I'm not a student.

302
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:31,193
Hey. Today, you were interviewed.

303
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:35,916
Are you okay?

304
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:41,113
- Thank you for today—
- You were incredible.

305
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,585
“I haven't accomplished anything.”

306
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:44,854
“I don't know what I'd be able to do.”

307
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:47,222
“I don't even know what I want to do.”

308
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,929
You were so honest.

309
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:56,539
Well, you obviously were desperate to get in anywhere.

310
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:02,361
But it is a strength to make excuses for yourself

311
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:06,159
and be able to regret it openly.

312
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,259
Lots of growth and emotions can only come from regret.

313
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,693
For example, for people who want to change themselves, like you,

314
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:21,639
regret can lead to happiness and can be a fuel to your life.

315
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:26,800
Our company is obsessed with burning fuel like that.

316
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,129
I've burned a lot of it, too.

317
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:35,419
So I'm pretty sure you'll be hired.

318
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:37,556
What?

319
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:42,281
Now then, want to grab a drink?

320
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,661
Um, well...

321
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:46,889
- Let's go!
- What?

322
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,293
Let's go.

323
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,604
Now I see.

324
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:03,904
What is it?

325
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:07,064
Hey, Togawa.

326
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,584
Yes?

327
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:11,469
Want to go grab a drink? It's been a while.

328
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,947
When you get a certain amount of experience,

329
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:19,126
it gets in the way of gaining new experiences.

330
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:24,500
You always predict negative outcomes

331
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,080
and don't let yourself do anything.

332
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,489
- There's a smoking area there.
- Oh, thanks.

333
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:33,592
But…

334
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:37,309
No, let's go to the station.

335
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:42,734
Are you quitting?

336
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:46,469
No, I'm thinking of cutting down.

337
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:50,589
I see, you're quitting, aren't you?

338
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:52,981
I never said that.

339
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:55,000
That's good.

340
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,533
I support your decision to quit.

341
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,589
Like I said, I never said I would.

342
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:03,371
Why are you laughing?

343
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:16,180
[Preview]
You're cute when you laugh, Togawa.

344
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:20,466
Nozue-san and Togawa-san got pretty close lately.

345
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:25,002
Acting like a girl and trying new things have amazing anti-aging properties.

346
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:27,548
Please act completely like a girl.

347
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:33,767
A girl should give a cuter response when hugged by a hot guy.

348
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,633
Nozue-san, are you mad?

349
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,365
I'm not mad.

350
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:38,867
Nozue-san.
