00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:02,178
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:07,942
Hey...

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,535
As for work,

4
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:14,221
I'll work even harder than I have before.

5
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:21,879
Allow me to continue working for you.

6
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:33,687
Please, let's keep being a normal boss and worker.

7
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:40,507
I apologize for the difficult request.

[Episode 5]

10
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,770
Morning.

11
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,672
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:51,253
Morning.

13
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,788
Here, I'm giving it back.

14
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,547
Oh, sorry.

15
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:33,748
I wish you would returned it a little more stealthily.

16
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,718
Stealthily?

17
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,360
Here?

18
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,770
- And here.
- Yeah.

19
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,620
I understand. Thanks.

20
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:16,184
Nozue-san, do you have a moment?

21
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:19,088
Oh, sure. Okay.

22
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:22,108
I sent a sales quota this morning.

23
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:28,568
Sorry, I haven't seen it yet. What is it?

24
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,740
Okay, once you see the email later...

25
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,783
No, I'll bring it over.

26
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:43,103
And here is the document you asked for.

27
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,912
Thank you.

28
00:04:55,988 --> 00:05:01,037
I'm almost 40, and he's almost 30.

29
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:04,371
I'm a guy, and he's a guy.

30
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:09,074
I'm his boss, and he is my subordinate.

31
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:12,311
Yes, a boss and his subordinate.

32
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:17,312
I'm just his boss.

33
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,533
Hey, Togawa, what are you doing for lunch?

34
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:27,659
Sorry, I have plans with another co-worker.

35
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:28,774
I see.

36
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:30,074
Yes.

37
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:39,182
Hey. What, are you tired?

38
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:40,172
Not really.

39
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:42,836
Hey, are you free for dinner?

40
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:43,952
I guess I am.

41
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,410
Do you know anywhere nice?

42
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,313
Wait, hold on.

43
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:57,324
Wow, you're pretty good at using your phone.

44
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,350
Yeah, I guess so.

45
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,150
- Well, this one, maybe.
- Yeah.

46
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,020
Shall we go for a round?

47
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,374
Hello.

48
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,650
Will we go by car?

49
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,370
- Yeah, okay.
- Really?

50
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,530
Yay!

51
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,620
What’s wrong?

52
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,980
I’m little worried…

53
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,270
Yeah, I guess.

54
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,892
You're incredible.

55
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,627
What?

56
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,630
No, it's nothing.

57
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:42,010
What's up? Did you need something?

58
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:45,258
Well, there's a new department being formed.

59
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:47,930
Oh, the Digital Promotion Department?

60
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,941
Yeah, it's a strategy support team that works on digital reformation

61
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:54,525
alongside the other departments.

62
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:57,496
Hey, Nozue.

63
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,962
Want to be a leader there?

64
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,336
What? You know I'm bad at technology.

65
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,864
Leave the technical stuff to the experts.

66
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:12,736
What I want is someone who can lead a team of quirky, hard-to-manage people.

67
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,050
I see.

68
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:22,215
Hey, this is an amazing opportunity.

69
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:27,213
You can't stifle yourself in that position forever.

70
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,440
I see.

71
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:36,208
It'll be in a new building near the station, too.

72
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,390
A new building, huh?

73
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,859
Ugh, I knew it.

74
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,203
Well, I wasn't expecting much,

75
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:49,773
but I reached out just in case.

76
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:51,967
I'll think about it.

77
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:56,135
Wait, no way, you're thinking about it?

78
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,365
Can't I?

79
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:01,044
No, that's fine.

80
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:07,225
You've changed.

81
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,379
Did I?

82
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,783
Yeah.

83
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,548
Nozue-san.

84
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,223
Nozue-san!

85
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:32,341
- Are you free on Friday night?
- What?

86
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:35,449
We're having a party for winning the Randal Industries Competition.

87
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,802
Oh, Friday?

88
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,144
Please come.

89
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,072
Oh, Togawa-san will be there too.

90
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,224
Okay, sure.

91
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:47,562
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll go.

92
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,744
Thank you!

93
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,550
Wow! It’s so good.

94
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,140
Yeah.

95
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:08,820
Nozue-san! Over here.

96
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,090
Yeah, for me…

97
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,042
- Nozue-san! Hello!
- Hello!

98
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:15,075
Hi!

99
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,240
It’s a secret.

100
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,960
It’s really good.

101
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,430
Right?

102
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,759
What should I get you?

103
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:30,603
Oh, it's just you, Nakamura-kun.

104
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,839
Yes, it is me, Nakamura.

105
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,906
A feast for my eyes. My energy.

106
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:42,414
Dear God, please keep Nozue-san single.

107
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,041
Okay.

108
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:47,666
But there's an unfortunate rumor.

109
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,246
- What?
- What is it?

110
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:52,503
He might transfer to a new department.

111
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,767
What?

112
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,542
And it's in a new office building.

113
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,121
No!

114
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,080
It's still just a rumor.

115
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,785
Then we won't see him anymore.

116
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,410
Who told you?

117
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,630
It’s only a rumor.

118
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,752
- Hold on.
- It's okay, I'll drink that.

119
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:09,780
- You mean this?
- Yes.

120
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,393
But I already drank from it.

121
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,070
It's fine, it looks good.

122
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,240
What?

123
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,739
No, it's not fine.

124
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:20,735
Don't let him drink this, it's too strong.

125
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,901
What?

126
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:26,334
Nozue-san, you should get going soon.

127
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,312
But the trains are still running.

128
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:30,757
Aren't you quite drunk already?

129
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:33,985
When did you drink so much?

130
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,350
Yeah, but...

131
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,761
Let's go, I'll catch a taxi for you.

132
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,469
But...

133
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:40,830
Come on, let's go.

134
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,096
- Wait.
- Please be careful.

135
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:46,640
- I'll take him home.
- You're taking him?

136
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,780
- Good work today.
- Be careful.

137
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,370
Oh, yeah.

138
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,801
Are you okay?

139
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,513
Sorry.

140
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:13,371
Thanks.

141
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,801
Please be careful.

142
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,259
Okay.

143
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:43,635
I don't see any taxis.

144
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,790
Yeah.

145
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:56,388
Are you really transferring?

146
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:00,386
You heard?

147
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:06,358
But it's not official yet.

148
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:12,688
It'll be nice to be near the station.

149
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,719
Yeah.

150
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:24,472
I'll take the train home.

151
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:26,963
You can't even stand straight. It's dangerous.

152
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:29,758
I'm meeting Ono-san before work tomorrow.

153
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:31,943
I'll be in your care until then.

154
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,020
Got it.

155
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,980
Get home safely.

156
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:10,853
It's fine. With time, I'll return to being a normal boss.

157
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,242
Nozue-san!

158
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm glad you're still here.

159
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:28,136
Why?

160
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:30,252
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:33,909
I forgot to hand this to you.

162
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:38,250
It might rain before you reach the station.

163
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,024
Did you go through all that trouble for me?

164
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:47,526
I have two, so don't worry.

165
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,515
Thanks.

166
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:04,091
- Hey—
- I'll go back then.

167
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:07,546
Really, please get home safely.

168
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,230
Please use this.

169
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,253
You have two again?

170
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,189
It's because you never bring one.

171
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:46,479
Thanks for watching out for me even outside of work.

172
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:49,231
I like being of help to you.

173
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:57,090
If I go back to my passive self,

174
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,034
Togawa will never smile for me again.

175
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,090
No, I'm not okay with that at all.

176
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,113
I can't just be his boss.

177
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:19,284
I want to see his cute smile.

178
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:21,887
I want him to get mad at me.

179
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:25,724
I want him to cry because of me.

180
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:30,735
All the human emotions. I want it all.

181
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:41,094
Togawa!

182
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:44,441
Nozue-san, are you okay? What's wrong?

183
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:46,041
I...

184
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,134
What?

185
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:52,720
I like you too.

186
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,600
So much that I could die.

187
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:02,327
Sorry, I just wanted to be your boss,

188
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:06,669
and I tried, but I couldn't.

189
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,197
Sorry.

190
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,185
You always did so much for me every day,

191
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,955
but I acted ignorantly.

192
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:20,946
I'm so sorry.

193
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:27,319
Hold on a second. Stop.

194
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:29,844
Hey.

195
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,510
Wait.

196
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,593
Togawa.

197
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,436
Nozue-san.

198
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,802
You're probably pitying me.

199
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,778
What?

200
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:50,099
No, maybe it's not pity.

201
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:56,599
You were probably just wavering because of my tears.

202
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,012
Don't worry about me.

203
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,527
I'm sorry I did such a thing to you.

204
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:15,600
We'll forget with time.

205
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:23,281
I won't forget, and I won't let you forget, either.

206
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,473
I don't want to forget.

207
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:30,371
The person who always cared for me every day...

208
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:31,695
There's no way I can forget.

209
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,732
- I'm saying that's...
- It's not a pity.

210
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,583
I was scared

211
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,579
about what would happen after saying I love you.

212
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:47,543
I didn't know, so I was scared.

213
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:54,039
Sorry, I was running again.

214
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,323
I'm sorry.

215
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:03,669
But not having you next to me tomorrow

216
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,118
is far scarier for me.

217
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:11,159
I'm your boss, and I'm not young.

218
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:18,094
I might be a stain or a burden to you later in your life.

219
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:19,248
That's...

220
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,920
But...

221
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:29,214
I'm young enough to be able to say that's just an excuse.

222
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,576
Right?

223
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:43,680
With you, I want to experience new happiness that you have yet to know.

224
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,920
And me too.

225
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:52,482
The good and the bad.

226
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,604
I'm confident I can be a part of your life.

227
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,180
I like you.

228
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,691
Nozue-san.

229
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,182
Yeah.

230
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,232
I like you.

231
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:31,069
Yeah.

232
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,116
Nozue-san.

233
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,268
Yeah.

234
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,084
Don't just be a part of my life.

235
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:51,184
Please, stay with me for our entire life.

236
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:57,549
Okay.

237
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,352
Have a good night!

238
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:13,260
Have a good night.

239
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,430
What should we do?

240
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,830
Everyone, what do you think?

241
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,390
What should we do?

242
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,130
Nearly!

243
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,970
Yeah.

244
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,050
Thanks to our channel managers: damiechan & oriannanixy_957

Thanks to all other language moderators!

249
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:54,185
Wait, hold on a second.

250
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:58,808
That wasn't funny.

251
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:02,181
Nozue-san, you're almost in your forties.

252
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:04,607
Be more careful about where you confess your love.

253
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:08,589
You're in your thirties, so be more careful where you take me.

254
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,816
- Nozue-san.
- Yeah?

255
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:17,019
It's okay.

256
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:21,160
Having an age gap or being a minority

257
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,859
is the same as having different hometowns

258
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:29,579
or cheering for a different baseball team.

259
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,656
It's nothing.

260
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:40,329
Let's have more fights, disagreements, and misunderstandings.

261
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:46,887
And let's keep making up like this all the way until our eighties.

262
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:52,210
What about when we're 81?

263
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,864
I'll go get my bag.

264
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,605
Please stay here.

265
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:07,308
Sure.

266
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:10,475
Don't leave, okay?

267
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:12,281
I got it.

268
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:15,538
Don't move from here.

269
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,003
Come on, hurry and go get it.

270
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:25,969
I'm almost 40, but I feel like I might kiss you anywhere.

271
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:34,009
Darn it.

272
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:49,303
I got this confirmed.

273
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:51,740
Thank you.

274
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:59,340
Hey, Takase-kun.

Okay.

Hey, let's go to lunch.

Sure, let's go with Togawa.
