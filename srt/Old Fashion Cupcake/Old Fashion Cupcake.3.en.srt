Oh, Kirishima and the others invited me.

You were goofing off again.

182

No, I was doing one of those brain exercises.

- Well, those are important.
- Yes.

Nozue-san, can you come drinking tonight?

We're sad, because Togawa said he can't come.

Yes, here.

192
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,300
I was saying…

193
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,420
- Oh, please.
- Thank you.

194
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,964
Nozue-san, here's a token of my thanks.

This is the best kind of drink.

Oh, I'm really sorry.

Thank you so much.

Where's Nozue-san?

He didn't seem too well.

210
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,139
So we decided to end it early.

211
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,098
Then where is he?

212
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:05,540
He left earlier, so I think he's gone home already.

By the way, you didn't come with us, but why were you there?

You went drinking even though you seemed unwell.

And you even disappeared on your own, so I got worried.

Why were you avoiding me?

You only came to me today about work.

Well...

00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,600
You're obviously avoiding me.

Did I do something?

I might've gotten too involved with your personal life.

Even though we're done with the anti-aging stuff,

00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:14,151
I came to your house uninvited and texted you late at night.

You're not just a boss to me, Nozue-san.

You're very special to me.

I respect you, even outside of the workplace.

262

So the anti-aging stuff, coming to my house,

263
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:47,554
texting late at night, and meeting on weekends

264
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,940
are all what I wanted.

265
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:54,261
Well, I guess it would be bad if your boss went senile.

266
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:58,842
Nozue-san, I think we should continue anti-aging a little more.

I texted you back.

What? I didn't get a reply. I've totally been checking.

275

"Totally"?

Why do you even have three? You turned off their notifications.
