I won't be staying at the shop recently.

I need to go home.

Could you look after the shop?

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,280
Is everything alright?

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,700
Zhenzhu has been acting oddly.

Come on.

Why didn't I think of it earlier?

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,900
Here, I just made these two.

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,110
Take them back for Zhenzhu.

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,550
You should've mentioned it earlier.

The shop doesn't need you anymore.

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,480
Our shop is getting better.

If we have the shop and lose our home,

43
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,020
what's the point of having the shop?
Go back now.

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,220
Alright, I'm leaving. Thanks.

to see these things now.

I'm back.

60
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,730
What are you doing here?

61
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,280
I brought lotus pods for you.

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,520
Chief Lin,

63
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,470
you don't have to do this.

64
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm the Chief in the shop,

65
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,170
but at home, you're in charge.

66
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,890
Besides, if it weren't
for your good fortune,

67
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,520
how could I be where I am today?

68
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,450
Is that true?

69
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,770
Of course.

70
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,770
Before our marriage,

71
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,840
I met an old man with a white beard.

72
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,270
He said

73
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,790
that my future wife would be

74
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,580
the best fortune-bringer in the world.

75
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,560
I didn't expect him to be right.

76
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,210
But I remember

77
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,120
that when we were first together,

78
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,640
in winter,

79
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,840
in the icy cold,

80
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,090
I asked you to go fishing in the river.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,420
That was

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,560
to strengthen my physique.

83
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,210
I also asked you to poke a wasp's nest.

84
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,370
That was to build up my courage.

85
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,960
I used to scold you

86
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,360
and put you down.

87
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,740
That was to cultivate

88
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,810
my unyielding will.

93
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,360

you should...

98
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,040

99

if I'm wrong, I'll change.

102
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,710
Give me another chance.

103
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,670
I promise I'll change.

the best performer

175

is Luo Zhusi from Jinyu Tea.

176

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,990
Have you expressed

181

our gratitude to her yet?

I have,

but I haven't given her any promises.

of their tea this year?

188

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,780
I heard it was jointly developed

192
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,360
by the Tea Master.

193
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,020
If that's the case,

194
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,430
wouldn't it be well-deserved

195
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,600
if she won the Contest?

196
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,930
Indeed.

197
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,960
Alright, promise her that.

198
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,050
Also,

199
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
when you speak

200
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,500
with Luo Zhusi,

201
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,380
make sure to explain

202
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,320
my difficulties.

203
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,660
You must make her feel

204
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,230
that the money she spent is worth it.

205
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,170
Right?

206
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,540
Understood, milord.

207
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,480
As expected of you.

208
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,110
You are truly thoughtful.

209
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,350
As expected of the Magistrate
of Taiping County.

210
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,740
- Alright.
- It's always like this.

211
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,680
You're always working.

212
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,640
Why does this tea have a pine oil smell?

213
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not just a pine oil smell,

214
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,720
but there's also a hint of smoke.

215
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,410
What do you think?

216
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,290
This is a very unique tea.

217
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,430
The strong taste of tar at the beginning

218
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,270
covers the longan
and honey orchid fragrance

219
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,050
in the aftertaste.

220
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,060
The water flows smoothly.

221
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,120
After taking a deep breath,

222
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,450
the lingering aroma
fills the mouth and nose,

223
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,450
lifting one's spirits.

224
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,960
However,

225
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,050
just like their reaction,

226
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,360
isn't the threshold a bit high?

227
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,190
Jing Kan created

228
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,480
this flavor on purpose.

229
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,120
You did it on purpose?

230
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,310
Guiwei brought

231
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,780
these firewood last time.

232
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,740
They contained some

233
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,840
pine needles and branches.

234
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,470
After the smoke entered the tea,

235
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,210
it unexpectedly created a unique flavor.

236
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to use this tea

237
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,360
to participate in the Tea Contest.

238
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,350
I think it's not as good

239
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,640
as the previous Anzhou Sweetie.

240
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,840
What do you think?

241
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,810
I understand your point,

242
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,320
but I still think it's a bit risky.

243
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,640
It might be too sophisticated.

244
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,130
Yes, Kan.

245
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,450
If you make a mistake,

246
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,820
not only will you lose the bet

247
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,660
with Luo Zhusi,

248
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,140
but also the hard work you've put in

249
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,080
will be in vain.

250
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,840
I understand your concerns.

251
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,770
Here's what I think.

252
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,110
If this were

253
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,350
just an ordinary contest,

254
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,720
I'd use the previous Anzhou Sweetie

255
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,540
to participate,

256
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
because ordinary people

257
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,090
would quickly accept it.

258
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,050
But it's the Tea Contest.

259
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,140
The selected tea

260
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,640
is meant for His Majesty.

261
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,830
To impress His Majesty,

262
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,530
our tea must have
unique characteristics.

263
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,980
I believe
the experienced tea connoisseurs

264
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,950
will be able to taste

265
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,290
the unique qualities of this tea.

266
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,330
I agree with what you said.

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,840
I support you.

268
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,620
As long as you've decided,

269
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,560
I support you, too.

270
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,760
Kan, you'll surely win.

271
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,530
Alright.

272
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,770
It's settled then.

273
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,290
We'll use Anzhou Sweetie.

274
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,170
Auntie,

275
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,070
why did you call me back?

276
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,010
Aji, you're here.

277
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,140
Auntie.

278
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,080
Aji,

279
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,600
are you ready?

280
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,250
Ready for what?

281
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,720
The Tea Contest.

282
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,690
The Tea Contest?

283
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,330
I heard Cuiying mention it before.

284
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,050
Are we really going?

285
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,350
Come on.

286
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,720
Of course.

287
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,860
I've already had the Tea Master

288
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,620
and Mr. Huang from Wuyi Mountain

289
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,840
create a new type of tea.

290
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,570
They used a silver pot to make it,

291
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,120
which makes it incredibly clear.

292
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,930
The taste is

293
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,930
unparalleled in the world.

294
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,210
I've already had them name it

295
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,760
Aji Tea.

296
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,410
Aji Tea?

297
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,560
That's right.

298
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,360
We will announce to the public

299
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,310
that this tea was made

300
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,090
with you and us together.

301
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,600
I've told

302
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,840
the Tea Master.

303
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,450
I've also taken care

304
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,480
of Magistrate Meng.

305
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,960
The champion of this Tea Contest

306
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,720
will definitely be Aji Tea.

307
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,250
Auntie,

308
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,450
why do you have to do this?

309
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,760
You're my only nephew.

310
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,000
If I don't do it for you,

311
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,200
who will I do it for?

312
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,880
Come to Jinyu Tea tomorrow,

313
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,380
and I'll give you

314
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,690
the position of deputy manager.

315
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,130
Then,

316
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,430
I will gradually teach you

317
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,050
all my life's work.

318
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,810
In two years,

319
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,120
you will be

320
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,050
the Chief of Jinyu Tea.

321
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,200
I don't want to.

322
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,050
- You...
- Why not?

323
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,350
Your auntie has been

324
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,690
planning this for years.

325
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,900
Auntie,

326
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,440
I just want to stay with Wan'er.

327
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,710
And I want to decide for myself

328
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,690
what I want to do

329
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,330
and what I don't want to do.

330
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,560
Goodbye.

331
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,530
Aji, listen to me.

332
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,770
Aji.

333
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,890
Goodbye.

334
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,690
What's gotten into him?

335
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,210
Madam, don't worry too much.

336
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,640
Perhaps

337
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,000
Young Master Aji is still too young.

338
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,950
He doesn't quite grasp

339
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,050
the things you mentioned.

340
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,530
Once you really teach him,

341
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,840
he'll surely like it.

342
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,450
I hope so.

343
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,720
Madam, there's another matter.

344
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,890
What is it?

345
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,410
That person is gone.

346
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,640
Gone?

347
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,330
What do you mean?

348
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,590
When our people in Qiongzhou
went to deliver

349
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,880
this month's money to him,

350
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,930
they found the place deserted.

351
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,050
Do you think

352
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,140
he gambled, lost again,

353
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,240
and got kidnapped?

354
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,530
If he got kidnapped,

355
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,210
that's not so bad.

356
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,680
There's nothing pitiable about it.

357
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,930
That's the fate of such a person.

358
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,450
But I'm afraid

359
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,810
he might suddenly come back.

360
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,880
Have Mr. Wang keep an eye on it.

361
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,680
Yes.

362
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,340
(Anning Prefecture Tea Contest)

363

Mr. Ge.

368
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,130
You're here.

369
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,360
How have you been lately?

370
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,680
I'm fine.

371
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,930
Chief Tan.

372
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,170
Chief Luo.

373

Chief Tan.

374
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,190
Excuse me, everyone.

375
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,350
Please move aside.

376
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,090
Nice to meet you.

377
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,710
Sixi, Kan.

378
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,590
Over here, over here.

379
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,530
There's some space?

380
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,230
So many people, yet such a big space?

381
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,480
The Imperial Censor has arrived.

382
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,470
Milord,

383
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,990
I failed to welcome you from afar.

384
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,200
Please forgive me.

385
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,670
Please.

386
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,160
Kan, who's that?

387
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,680
The Imperial Censor.

388
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,120
The Imperial Censor?

389
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,440
What does he do?

390
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,320
He's a very important official.

391
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,130
He's very powerful.

392
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,230
So many people.

393
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,200
Today is quite lively.

394
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,680
The more lively it is,

395
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,250
the more we must be careful.

396
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,250
Understood. I'll stay alert.

397
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,610
Keep your distance.

398
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,170
Sixi,

399
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,560
I have a very strong feeling

400
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,700
that I will definitely be

401
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,880
the champion today.

402
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,580
Of course.

403
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,970
Unless they have no taste.

404
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,250
The tea is light as air

405
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,880
and fragrant as orchids.

406
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,680
The Emperor's grace is vast.

407
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,440
The common people are at peace.

408
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,910
Here,

409
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,730
on behalf of Imperial Censor Pei

410
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,290
and Magistrate Meng,

411
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,920
I welcome every tea merchant present.

412
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,820
Good.

413
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,980
(Endless Joy)
Good.

414
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,810
Good.

415
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,820
Today,

416
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,670
we are also very fortunate

417
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,400
to have the Tea Master and Beiju Master

418
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,920
as judges for this contest.

419
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,240
As usual,

420
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,020
the champion of today's contest

421
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,840
will have the honor of making

422
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,640
this year's tribute tea.

423
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,300
Therefore,

424
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,950
no matter who wins today,

425
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,470
it will be the utmost glory

426
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,740
for Anning Prefecture

427
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,530
and Taiping County.

428
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,970
(Endless Joy)
This year,

429
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,640
there are 100 types of tea

430
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,160
from tea merchants in Anning Prefecture

431
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,730
participating in the contest.

432
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,580
Except for the withdrawal

433
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,290
of Qilin Tea's Biquan Shiru,

434
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,440
there are 99 types of tea on site.

435
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,630
We'll divide them into groups of ten

436
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,360
and evaluate them in turn.

437
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,910
Next,

438
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,490
please draw lots to decide

439
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,010
the order of evaluation.

440
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,960
Bai.

441
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,330
If I get No. 1,

442
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,700
we'll become famous overnight.

443
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,710
Yes.

444
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,970
We'll become famous overnight!

445
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,070
Good.

446
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,640
How silly.

447
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,280
Go ahead.

448
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,780
Sixi, is my voice too loud?

449
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,820
Everyone's looking at me.

450
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,060
Why aren't you drawing?

451
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,000
Go, go, go.

452
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,200
They act like they don't want to win.

453
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,810
Longquan Tea.

454
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,640

455
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,760

Jinyu Tea.

459
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,970
Tianshui Tea.

460
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,440
Jinyu Tea.

461
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,870
- Kan.
- How is it?

462
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,810
How's it going?

463
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,420
(1)

464
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,730
Heaven is on your side.

465
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,150
Be gentle.

466
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,230
Guiwei, give me the tea.

467
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,330
Alright, here.

468
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,930
Don't joke with us.

469
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,090
The tea is gone.

470
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,040
- Kan.
- Give it to me.

471
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,330
It's gone.

472
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,910
Could it be with An Wanqing?

473
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,000
An Wanqing...

474
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,040
Where's An Wanqing?

475
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,880
Where is she?
She was just here a moment ago.

476
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,540
Don't panic. Stay calm.

477
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,770
Don't show any signs.

478
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,190
You two stay calm.

479
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,160
I'll go find An Wanqing.

480
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,570
Take it.

481
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,880
How could it just be gone?

482
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,340
Merchants No. 1 to No. 10...

483
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,630
I've been holding it all along.

484
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,370
Please get ready.

485
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,630
In an incense stick of time,

486
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,490
the contest will officially begin.

487
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,470
Kan, we're No. 1. What should we do?

488
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,410
Shut up.

489
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,370
What should we do?

490
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,150
- Move.
- Let go.

491
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,090
Go.

492
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,240
Help!

493
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,590
- Don't shout.
- Let go.

494
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,760
Why are you shouting?

495
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,470
Let me tell you.

496
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,880
Jing Kan can dream about winning.

497
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,670
- Move.
- Go.

498
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,710
I can walk by myself.

499
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,650
Don't touch me.

500
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,490
This is No. 5, right?

501
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,290
They just finished.

502
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,050
Sir, what's your number?

503
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,410
No. 5.

504
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,670
It's okay.

505
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,610
You guys continue.

506
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,090
What is Jing Kan doing?

507
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,530
Sir, you dropped something.

508
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,990
- Something?
- Yes.

509
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,050
Sir, what's your number?

510
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,940
No. 15. What's the matter?

511
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,930
Let's switch.

512
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,100
What's your number?

513
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,040
I'm No. 1.

514
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,000
No. 1.

515
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,360
Are you that nervous?

516
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,200
My stomach hurts a bit.

517
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,960
No.

518
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,440
Fifteen is my lucky number.

519
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,370
Is there anyone

520
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,190
who wants to be No. 1?

521
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,740
(Endless Joy)
Who wants to go first?

522
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,980
You can become famous overnight.

523
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,160
He's No. 1.

524
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,490
An Wanqing.

525
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,900
(Tea)
Sir, sir.

526
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,340
Did you see a girl in a pink dress,

527
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,740
a white short jacket,

528
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,950
with a small bag, a strap,

529
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,350
and holding such a big tea canister?

530
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,920
I think I saw her.

531
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,360
She was taken out of the city
by two men.

532
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,650
Thank you.

533
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,940
(Tea)

534
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,360
An Wanqing! Wanqing!

535
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,160
Wanqing's skirt.

536
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,680
An Wanqing!

537
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,810
Wanqing's short jacket.

538
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,360
If you dare to pick it up,

539
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,120
I'll shoot you dead.

540
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,810
What a clumsy trap.

541
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,600
Where did you hide An Wanqing?

542
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,930
Pretending, right?

543
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,050
Pretending?

544
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,400
I'll talk, I'll talk.

545
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,260
(Bumian Tea, Qinxin Cuiying)

546
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,090
The first one.

547
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,770
Yapeiteng from Xihuoqing Tea.

548
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,010
Yapeiteng from Xihuoqing Tea.

549
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,490
B+.

550
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,780
The second one.

551
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,600
Ziyan Quhao from Yufeng Tea.

552
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,880
It was under-fermented.

553
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,000
How can they participate in the contest?

554
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,300
(18)
Ziyan Quhao from Yufeng Tea.

555
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,240
C-.

556
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,040
The third one.

557
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,920
Momei Tuzhong.

558
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,010
You're No. 92?

559
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,930
I'm No. 18.

560
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,290
Sir, let's switch, shall we?

561
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,820
Why do you want to switch

562
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,920
to such a late position?

563
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,280
I saw you over there just now,

564
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,500
wanting to grab the first place

565
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,810
to become famous overnight.

566
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,090
My tea was stolen.

567
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,820
It's your turn next.

568
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,990
Your tea was stolen?

569
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,020
Yes, sir.

570
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,330
Can you help me?

571
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,970
I'd like to help you,

572
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,290
but fellow tradesmen are enemies.

573
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,440
If you don't have your tea,

574
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,500
then I'll have

575
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,680
one less competitor, won't I?

576
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,710
The tea of No. 18 was stolen.

577
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,800
He doesn't have tea.
Don't switch numbers with him.

578
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,820
It's almost his turn.

579
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,060
Don't switch numbers with him.

580
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,330
Don't switch numbers with him.

581
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,780
It's almost his turn.

582
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,920
Jing Kan's tea is lost.

583
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,720
Really?

584
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,120
He was so arrogant just now.

585
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,840
Let him make a fuss.

586
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,530
He won't be able to for long.

587
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,220
(62)

588
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,050
What are you doing?

589
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,330
Let me tell you.

590
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,120
If Jing Kan loses,

591
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,730
I'll let you go right away.

592
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,010
If he wins,

593
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,190
I'll send both of you down together.

594
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,230
Where?

595
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,730
I'll send both of you over.

596
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,810
Where to?

597
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,250
How can you not understand?

598
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,770
I'll kill both of you.

599
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,850
Do you understand now?

600
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,930
Come on.

601
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,920
You just don't want him to win, right?

602
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,150
His tea wasn't good

603
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,910
to begin with, really.

604
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,050
Do I look that naive?

605
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,640
I'm going to pour it all out

606
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,250
and stomp on it.

607
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,530
You want to trick me
into letting you go back?

608
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,920
Dream on.

609
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,370
I can see it now.

610
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,900
You must be in cahoots with Luo Zhusi.

611
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,640
No!

612
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,060
Then why did your voice get so high?

613
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,000
I...

614
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,530
Did my voice get high?

615
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,230
You love her.

616
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,170
No.

617
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,580
She doesn't love you.

618
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,630
Mind your own business.

619
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,470
How about this?

620
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,530
Talk to me.

621
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,060
I'm good at counseling people.

622
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,360
Mind your own business.

623
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,520
Don't touch me.

624
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,250
No, I...

625
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,910
So noisy.

626
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,530
My business is none of your concern.

627
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,200
My goodness, just go.

628
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,570
Hurry up and go.

629
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,610
I'm in a hurry.

630
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,170
Go.

631
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,360
Hurry.

632
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,880
Go.

633
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,960
Stop.

634
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,200
Wanqing's bracelet?

635
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,910
Aren't you Mr. Wang from the main store?

636
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,930
What are you doing here?

637
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,630
Yes, I am.

638
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,570
Well,

639
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,910
I saw you were in danger.

640
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,910
This guy was going to sneak attack you.

641
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,970
I helped you knock him out.

642
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,260
I was behind him.

643
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,600
How could he sneak attack me?

644
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,090
He kidnapped An Wanqing.

645
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,150
I'm using him as a guide.

646
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,500
How am I supposed to use him now?

647
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,430
What?

648
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,770
Wanqing was kidnapped?

649
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,920
That guy is so despicable.

650
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,520
Indeed.

651
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,780
People like him

652
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,230
should be childless

653
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,510
- and alone forever.
- Stop.

654
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,440
So, what do you think we should do now?

655
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,630
We have to find An Wanqing

656
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,780
and get the tea to Jing Kan,

657
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,450
because the contest has already started.

658
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes, the contest is important.

659
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,340
But tell me.

660
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,290
The mountain is so big.

661
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,640
Where are we supposed
to find An Wanqing?

662
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,340
Where to look?

663
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,260
Indeed.

664
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,200
Isn't it?

665
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,760
My face.

666
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,890
This is lime.

667
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,770
It will damage my face.

668
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,530
Take me to An Wanqing now,

669
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,490
or I'll blind you.

670
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,610
Go.

671
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,640
I can't see.

672
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,570
Zhufeng Yinyue

673
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,680
from Linjiangzhu Tea.

674
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,120
C+.

675
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,840
The 33rd one.

676
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,570
Cuimeiren from Ruicao Tea.

677
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,130
Kan,

678
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,200
did you switch numbers?

679
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,750
65.

680
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,650
65 is fine.

681
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,570
No. 65 is coming up.

682
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,400
Cuimeiren from Ruicao Tea.

683
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,400
A-.

684
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,630
The 34th one.

685
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,190
Luhuaxian from Laolongtan Tea.

686
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,130
Milord.

687
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,680
Ruicao Tea is only A-.

688
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,990
Are you sure?

689
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,330
Why is it so strict this year?

690
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,530
Kan, what do you think about A-?

691
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,170
It's okay, it's okay.

692
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,890
The tea is good.

693
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,090
This tea is really good.

694
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,970
Don't you think

695
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,910
this tea is very similar
to the Banfang Tea

696
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,770
we used to offer as tribute?

697
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,200
The Emperor has tasted this flavor.

698
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,920
If we offer this tea again this year,

699
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,060
it's hard to guarantee

700
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,870
that the Emperor won't suspect

701
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,840
our loyalty.

702
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,640
Though the taste is similar,

703
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,400
it has improved in aroma,

704
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,920
and the tea soup is clearer.

705
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,200
Besides,

706
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,770
the Emperor's recommendation
of Banfang Tea

707
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,090
means he likes this flavor.

708
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,090
The Emperor

709
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,430
hasn't tasted this tea for years.

710
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,490
If the Emperor drinks it,

711
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,970
he will surely be very pleased.

712
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,340
This time,
Laolongtan Tea will win, right?

713
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,280
Win what?

714
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,100
What's so good about tea anyway?

715
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,770
Elaborate for everyone to hear.

716
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,470
Man,

717
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,840
victory and defeat are common.

718
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,960
Tasting tea is secondary.

719
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,710
The character of the tea
is what matters.

720
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,050
Do you have the character of tea?

721
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,390
I want them to talk more,

722
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,680
so we can learn from them.

723
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,300
Have you found your tea leaves?

724
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,600
None of your business.

725
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,570
Luhuaxian from Laolongtan Tea.

726
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,880
A+.

727
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,060
Next, Sanyueqin Tea.

728
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,240
(Laolongtan Tea, Luhuaxian, A)

729
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,410
Wanqing.

730
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,880
Go over there, go.

731
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,200
Quick, quick.

732
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,040
My eyes.

733
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,380
What's wrong with his eyes?

734
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
You really care too much.

735
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,820
You still care about him now?

736
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,640
Where are the tea leaves?

737
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,760
Over there.

738
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,200
It's over.

739
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,150
Jing Kan definitely won't win now.

740
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,240
Forget about it, let's go.

741
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,610
Don't move.

742
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,600
You want to sneak attack?

743
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,640
I advise you not to act rashly.

744
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,020
You're in my hands now.

745
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,050
You shouldn't act rashly.

746
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,880
I think you should tell yourself that.

747
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,150
Wanqing.

748
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,200
Throw the knife away.

749
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,280
Sixi,

750
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,640
let him stab me to death,

751
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,250
but you have to promise me

752
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,120
that after he stabs me,

753
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,810
you'll stab those two to death.

754
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,740
If you don't let her go,

755
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,820
I'll stab him.

756
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,760
Go ahead.

757
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,290
Playing this game, huh?

758
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,370
Pretending not to care?

759
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,250
Do you think I care about her?

760
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,670
You don't?

761
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,440
Alright, let's stab together.

762
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,820
Fine.

763
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,840
- Come on.
- Three, two, one.

764
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,030
Wait a minute.

765
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,040
Alright, I give up.

766
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,650
Don't be impulsive.

767
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,370
Go over there.

768
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,160
It seems we can't help Jing Kan
this time.

769
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,120
It's my fault for being careless.

770
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,670
Actually, I could have guessed

771
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,330
that they'd use such dirty tricks.

772
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,090
What's the use of that?

773
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,600
They still have to be dirty.

774
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,940
(B)

775
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,300
Kan, what should we do?

776
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,250
It's almost our turn.

777
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,920
Where is Sixi?

778
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,090
Where did An Wanqing run off to
with the tea?

779
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,920
Kan, could you hold this for me?

780
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,190
When I get nervous,

781
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,160
I get a bit hungry.

782
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,400
My stomach is burning now.

783
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,840
I want to eat a zongzi.

784
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,500
You want to eat a zongzi now?

785
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,590
Put it away.

786
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,670
It makes us look unprofessional.

787
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,150
If we were professionals,
we wouldn't have lost the tea.

788
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,680
Stop bothering me.

789
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,360
Actually, I have some tea leaves hidden.

790
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,650
It's too late.

791
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,010
Even if we go over there now,

792
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,110
it'll probably be too late.

793
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,440
In Guiwei's bamboo tube.

794
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,530
Really, Wanqing.

795
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,390
You're so considerate.

796
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,630
You gave me such a scare.

797
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,190
Let's pull together to break it open.

798
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,600
Come on, three, two, one, go.

799
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,950
- No.
- One, two, go.

800
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,150
Don't be too happy yet.

801
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,300
Only I know about this.

802
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,470
I didn't tell him

803
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,410
before I got caught.

804
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,440
What?

805
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,690
Help.

806
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,640
Help!

807
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,730
Lord Pei,

808
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,910
would you like

809
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,950
to take a walk

810
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,570
or use the restroom?

811
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,160
It's okay.

812
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,730
I can hold on.

813
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,970
You can?

814
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,890
How remarkable of you.

815
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,530
Hold on a bit longer.

816
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,490
The sixth group's contest is over.

817
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,060
Next, the seventh group,

818
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,000
please get ready.

819
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,930
Pour a little less tea.

820
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,370
Kan, Luo Zhusi is here.

821
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,650
What should we do?

822
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,990
How about we switch numbers again?

823
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,930
So we can go later.

824
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,210
Don't be nervous.

825
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,120
Take a deep breath.

826
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,370
What should we do?

827
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,080
What's that sound?

828
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,330
What should we do?

829
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,290
Kan.

830
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,680
Kan, Kan.

831
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,930
The tea leaves.

832
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,040
You brat.

833
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,370
How long will you keep it from me?

834
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,310
You're driving me crazy.

835
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,880
I didn't hide it. I don't know who did.

836
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,620
The seventh group,

837
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,560
is there anyone?

838
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,390
Yes, here, here.

839
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,330
Coming, coming.

840
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:55,860
(Endless Joy)

841
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,240
(Jinyu Tea, Aji Tea)
Xianyuan Bilu from Momei Tuzhong.

842
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,410
B+.

843
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,060
Next,

844
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,320
Aji Tea from Jinyu Tea.

845
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,990
This tea is extraordinary.

846
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,930
Very extraordinary indeed.

847
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,090
Lord Pei, what do you think?

848
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,090
This tea is indeed good.

849
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,140
It's been many years

850
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,700
since I've had such an amazing feeling.

851
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,640
This tea has a subtle chestnut aroma,

852
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,200
and after swallowing,

853
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,160
there is

854
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,970
a faint orchid fragrance.

855
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,800
When I take a deep breath,

856
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,010
I feel the fragrance filling my mouth,

857
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,890
a spring bubbling under my tongue.

858
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,010
It's good,

859
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,160
but I still think

860
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,140
Laolongtan Tea's Luhuaxian

861
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,890
has more tea charm than this.

862
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,370
Come on.

863
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,490
Why mention Luhuaxian?

864
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,540
I didn't mean that.

865
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Then what do you mean?

866
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,100
You should praise them in front of them.

867
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,130
If I praise my child

868
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,870
in front of your child,
will you like that?

869
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,810
You...

870
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,640
Aji Tea from Jinyu Tea.

871
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,200
A+.

872
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,010
Another A+.

873
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,690
Now, it's a tie

874
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,480
(Jinyu Tea, Aji Tea, A)
with Laolongtan Tea.

875
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,740
This is going to be interesting.

876
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,750
Next one, Qionghua Yuchuan.

877
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,690
Good.

878
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,850
Kan, they're also A+.

879
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,080
Mind your own business.

880
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,600
Don't worry about them.

881
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,050
A+.

882
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,930
Hanquan Yuelu from Qingxuan Lanyue.

883
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,250
C-.

884
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,370
The next one.

885
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,760
Anzhou Sweetie from Jinyu Tea.

886
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,940
(Jinyu Tea, Anzhou Sweetie)

887
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,680
This tea soup doesn't look good.

888
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,120
Yes.

889
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,250
There seems to be a problem
with the tea leaves.

890
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,540
No need to taste it.

891
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,480
Let's go.

892
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,960
Milord,

893
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,850
this tea is carefully developed by me.

894
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,750
Please take a sip first

895
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,790
before making a decision.

896
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,200
Strong taste, straight to the nose,

897
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,720
but with a hidden honey fragrance
at the bottom,

898
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,890
warm and smooth like jade.

899
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,330
Wonderful.

900
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,890
This tea is indeed extraordinary.

901
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,890
This year's Tea Contest

902
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,090
has been full of surprises.

903
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,930
Yes, yes.

904
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,930
However, I think

905
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,260
since we are choosing tribute tea

906
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,730
for the Emperor,

907
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,720
if the taste is too unique

908
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,090
and the Emperor doesn't like it,

909
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,350
wouldn't we not only fail
to achieve anything

910
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,680
but also make a mistake?

911
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,870
Milord,

912
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,010
I have a humble suggestion.

913
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,000
Go ahead.

914
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,660
The reason why tea has lasted

915
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,580
for thousands of years

916
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,850
is that it keeps changing.

917
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,890
From being used as medicine and food

918
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,410
to being drunk today,

919
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,620
it's because the methods

920
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,930
of making and drinking tea

921
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,600
keep renewing themselves.

922
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,790
Since the way of drinking tea

923
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,760
has changed,

924
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,910
the development of tea

925
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,200
has been more and more rapid.

926
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,540
I believe

927
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,660
that in the future,

928
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,160
tea will have a thousand flavors,

929
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,210
each leading the trend.

930
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,760
If you hope

931
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,850
for the better development of tea,

932
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,590
please give Anzhou Sweetie

933
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,090
a chance to let the people know

934
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,600
that the Emperor hopes

935
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,850
that the state can embrace

936
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,270
everything and allow everything

937
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,280
to thrive.

938
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,970
Yes, that's very well said.

939
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,580
Good, well said!

940
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,620
- Good.
- Good.

941
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,800
- Great.
- Great.

942
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,970
- Good.
- Well said.

943
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,860
(Endless Joy)

944
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,370
Good.

945
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,720
Anzhou Sweetie from Jinyu Tea.

946
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,370
A+.

947

A+, A+.

949
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,090

(Anzhou Sweetie)
Good.

(A+: Aji Tea, Luhuaxian, Anzhou Sweetie)

955
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,900
(Anning Prefecture Tea Contest)

956
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,370
Tea merchants,

957
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,760
the officials

958
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,530
have already decided the result.

959
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,790
Who will be the champion

960
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,850
of this year's Tea Contest?

961
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,620
Let's invite Lord Pei

962
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,570
to announce it for us.

963
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,430
- Good.
- Good.

964
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,160
- Great.
- Great.

965
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,970
The tea from Taiping County this year

966
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,800
has really impressed me.

967
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,490
The tea chosen as tribute

968
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,240
not only continues the tradition

969
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,050
but also has a unique flavor.

970
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,570
It has a sophisticated technique
and a rich taste.

971
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,100
I believe

972
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,970
the Emperor will also be very satisfied

973
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,490
with this tea.

974
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,850
Now I announce

975
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,370

of this year's Tea Contest is...
