I'm tired.

Why is your voice

so hoarse?

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,220
From delivering messages.

Delivering messages?

34
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,340
What message?

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,660
Don't worry about it.

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,260
Whose things are these?

37
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
Where did they come from?

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,260
They're things thrown away.

Thrown away?

You...

41
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,220
They were thrown away?

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,580
This bracelet is so pretty.

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,140
You...

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,620
They look like the ones

45
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,620
Mother and Ms. Luo have.

46
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,580
You're right.

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,420
They're theirs.

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,900
Theirs?

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,940
How did they end up here?

50
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,900
I've been sowing discord

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,380
between Auntie and Grandmother.

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,690
In a few days,

53
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,660
Luo Zhusi should be

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,540
thrown out of the house.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,420
Really?

56
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,620
You're so clever.

57
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,180
Your deeds

58
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,100
aren't obvious, right?

59
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,700
They won't notice, right?

60
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,260
Do you think I'm like you?

61
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,740
So annoying.

62
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,700
I'm telling you.

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
I did it flawlessly.

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,980
No one will discover it.

65
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,780
- Smart.
- Ms. Xue, you're here.

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,940
Why are you here, Jiao'e?

67
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,500
The Old Lady and Ms. Luo are fighting.

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,180
They want to get Zhenzhu
to be a witness.

69
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,540
A witness for what?

70
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,940
Ms. Luo said

71
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,820
she didn't say
she'd torture the Old Lady

72
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,460
and drink sesame paste out of her ashes.

73
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,680
The Old Lady didn't believe it

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,880
and said she wanted

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,840
to have it investigated.

76
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,540
Why report family matters?

77
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,620
I...

78
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,980
I can't go.

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,260
I can't go.

80
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,620
I have something important.

81
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,740
What is it?

82
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,300
She has

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,660
to attend a Tea Guild meeting.

84
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,460
Right, I have to go to the Tea Guild.

85
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,500
It's an important meeting.

86
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,460
The Old Lady said you have to go,

87
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,820
or they'll come over.

88
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,860
Will you go,

89
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,940
or have them come here?

90
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,380
Mother.

91
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,540
It's fine.

92
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,500
Just go. It's fine.

93
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,460
No, you have to come with me.

94
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,300
No.

95
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,540
I have work at my shop.

96
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,700
You go yourself.

97
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,980
Come on.

98
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,180
Are you really my mother?

99
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,780
I've never seen you walk so fast.

100
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,460
Grandmother dotes on you.

101
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,500
Go.

102
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,460
Go ahead.

103
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,620
It's okay that you don't go.

104
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,740
Why the attitude?

105
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,780
Hurry up.

106
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,180
Oh, my.

107
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,020
When did I ever say that?

108
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,060
Clearly, you...

109
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,100
- You...
- You misspoke.

110
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,650
You won't admit it?

111
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,740
You...

112
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
When did I ever say this?

113
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,820
- Clearly...
- Zhenzhu, come here.

114
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,900
The witness is here.

115
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,240
What did she say about me?

116
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,100
She said I should live
in the ancestral hall.

117
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,260
Repeat the words.

118
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,780
Say it.

119
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,700
Tell Grandmother

120
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,900
exactly what I said

121
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,820
and why I said it.

122
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,940
Say it.

123
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,620
It's been so long.

124
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,380
I can't remember

125
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,340
what exactly it was.

126
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,260
How about this?

127
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,020
Let's just say I said it.

128
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,420
Don't play peacemaker.

129
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,700
What did she say?

130
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,900
You say it.

131
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,020
Today, I'm going

132
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,540
to utterly humiliate her.

133
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,020
Such a coward.

134
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,420
Baoyi is better.

135
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,300
You...

136
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,220
Here you go again.

137
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,460
Actually,

138
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,740
it's pretty much the same

139
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,060
as what you just said.

140
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,620
I think it's better for you

141
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,780
to communicate

142
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,300
face-to-face.

143
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,700
It's getting late.

144
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,420
I'll wash up and go to sleep.

145
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,540
- Come back.
- Wait.

146
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,860
It's midday.

147
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,220
Why sleep?

148
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,660
I think

149
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,300
as a family,

150
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,060
there's no need to make it so ugly.

151
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,740
Why not let it go?

152
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,460
Just do me a favor,

153
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,060
and let's have peace,

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,700
okay? Good.

155
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,100
I'll go check if the meal is ready.

156
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,700
Zhenzhu,

157
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,140
your behavior today

158
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,660
is a bit strange.

159
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,540
You even tried to mediate

160
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,920
and get everyone to get along.

161
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,620
We're family. Shouldn't we?

162
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,860
Zhenzhu, don't be afraid of trouble.

163
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,620
Today, I'm on your side.

164
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,780
What did she say?

165
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,700
Tell me,

166
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
or it seems like I've wronged her.

167
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,180
Say it.

168
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,660
Grandmother,

169
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Auntie has already

170
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,860
worked hard enough.

171
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,460
Even if I repeat those words,

172
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,900
what difference

173
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,500
will it make?

174
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,620
Right?

175
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,060
Just let her go.

176
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,220
Let her go work.

177
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,780
Zhenzhu,

178
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,940
I've watched you grow up.

179
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,780
When have you ever

180
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,700
defended me?

181
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,460
As you said, I've grown up, right?

182
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,380
Growing up

183
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,300
happens in an instant.

184
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,100
Zhenzhu,

185
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,580
what about the hairpins I gave her?

186
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,740
Hairpins?

187
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,020
What hairpins?

188
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,500
Don't just smile. Tell me.

189
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,700
Well.

190
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,060
I just want you

191
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,340
to have dignity

192
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,780
when you meet.

193
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,140
Old Lady.

194
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,540
Old Lady.

195
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,220
Ms. Xue

196
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,260
went shopping

197
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,100
and took the Qingming Stick.

198
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,060
Use this.

199
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,540
Grandmother!

200
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,500
- Zhenzhu.
- I was wrong.

201
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,340
Just hold on.

202
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,260
Stop.

203
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,860
31, 32, 33,

204
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,980
34, 35, 36,

205
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,060
37...

206
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,060
Stop it! I was wrong!

207
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
Give it here!

208
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
(Mind-awakening Chamber)
I won't talk back.

209
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,540
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

210
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,940
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

211
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,900
Why is my life

212
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,340
so bitter?

213
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,500
My hand...

214
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,060
Leave after one incense stick's time.

215
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,380
Understood, Nanny.

216
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,300
Thanks.

217
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,580
Such fragrant wine.

218
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,780
How dare you come back?

219
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,260
What happened?

220
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,620
Your courage and spirit

221
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,220
truly impress me.

222
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,580
What's this?

223
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,940
Is it comfortable?

224
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,980
It's alright.

225
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,500
More pressure here.

226
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,540
Okay.

227
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,460
Not bad.

228
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,700
With your skill,

229
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,860
those who'd like to serve you

230
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,380
would form a long line.

231
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,300
Today, it's truly an honor for me

232
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,460
to massage your shoulders.

233
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,380
Such an honor.

234
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,260
You surely know how to ingratiate.

235
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,500
Yes, yes.

236
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,180
Are you the wife

237
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,940
of Jing Kan,

238
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,340
my great-grandson?

239
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,380
Yes.

240
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,260
See?

241
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,740
We're family.

242
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,580
Whatever happens,

243
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,980
we're still related.

244
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,140
Besides,

245
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,860
you've gotten your way.

246
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
Just take me out.

247
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,060
I promise.

248
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,580
If you take me out,

249
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,740
from today,

250
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,180
you'll enjoy the good life

251
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,420
in Jing Residence.

252
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,780
The good life?

253
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,940
Haven't you had enough here?

254
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,980
No. 132.

255
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,380
To be honest,

256
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,940
I've also faced difficulties

257
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,380
and experienced some hardships

258
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,860
in Jing Residence.

259
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,780
Of course.

260
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,740
To be honest,

261
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,980
all the Jings

262
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,020
are bad,

263
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,500
including you.

264
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,660
Indeed, indeed.

265
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,260
You were right just now.

266
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,540
No one is good there.

267
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,780
When I was there,

268
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,700
Luo Zhusi never liked me.

269
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,780
And my niece.

270
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,840
She's the most selfish one.

271
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,940
You mean Grandmother?

272
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,460
She's alright, right?

273
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,500
I don't think so.

274
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,100
Listen.

275
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,620
When she was eight,

276
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,700
to win at skipping stones,

277
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,000
she'd go to the river a day early

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,860
and pick

279
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,740
all the good stones.

280
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,140
Is that normal?

281
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,860
At six years old,

282
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,300
she compared who had a longer tongue

283
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,340
with the neighbor's dog.

284
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,620
Wasn't she crazy or not?

285
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,780
At four years old...

286
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,700
Wait.

287
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,820
How old were you when she was four?

288
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,900
I...

289
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,140
That's what my family told me.

290
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,940
Let me finish. Don't interrupt.

291
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,100
Her mother once said to her,

292
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,600
"No ivory comes out of a dog's mouth."

293
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,520
Guess what she did?

294
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,380
She really tried to find ivory
in a dog's mouth.

295
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,420
If it weren't for my cousin

296
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,780
saving the dog,

297
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,860
the dog would've died.

298
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,900
Alright, alright.

299
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,780
I got the picture.

300
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,220
Change the topic.

301
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,660
So,

302
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,380
take me out, will you?

303
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,940
No. 132,

304
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,900
I came today

305
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,420
to see if you're sincere.

306
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,940
Just now, I saw some signs,

307
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,580
and I plan to let bygones be bygones.

308
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,280
I'll go back and ask Grandmother

309
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,740
to write a guarantee letter for you

310
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,140
on behalf of your maternal family.

311
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,780
If we're quick,
you might leave tomorrow.

312
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,020
Tomorrow?

313
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,980
What about today?

314
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,860
Come on.

315
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,740
I really can't stay

316
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,140
another moment in this place.

317
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,820
Today, without the letter,

318
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,120
you can't leave, so be patient.

319
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,260
I can climb walls.

320
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,700
Climb walls?

321
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,380
Don't you think that place

322
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,140
is a bit unlucky?

323
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,060
No.

324
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,380
I just want to leave.

325
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,540
I beg you.

326
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,180
Take me away.

327
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,140
Aren't you disgusted?

328
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,940
I really want to leave.

329
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,740
Please, take me away.

330
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,100
Go away.

331
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,860
If you take me away,

332
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,900
from today on,

333
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,580
I'll do whatever

334
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,460
you ask me to.

335
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,660
Please, take me away.

336
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,740
I beg you.

337
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,900
Who will go first?

338
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,460
I betrayed you once.

339
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,020
Last time, you betrayed me.

340
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,340
This time,

341
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,540
let's not betray each other,

342
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,620
okay?

343
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,620
I swear.

344
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,100
This time, I won't betray you.

345
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,620
Alright.

346
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,220
Then I'll go first.

347
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,380
You have no objections, right?

348
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,380
- Alright.
- Good.

349
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,340
Come on.

350
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,940
- Come.
- Come on.

351
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,860
One, two.

352
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,620
Hold on tight.

353
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,660
This line sounds familiar.

354
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,900
You wouldn't...

355
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,980
Who?

356
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,580
- Who?
- They're here.

357
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,520
- Who?
- Who's there?

358
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,080
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

359
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,620
Sorry.

360
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,020
I didn't mean it this time.

361
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,140
You messed with me again.

362
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,660
Who?

363
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,820
Well...

364
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,220
Nanny.

365
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,420
Nanny.

366
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,260
Can I borrow your shoulder?

367
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,580
I want to go down.

368
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,420
It's you again, No. 132.

369
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,660
You just can't stop climbing walls,
can you?

370
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,100
She gave me an idea.

371
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,900
If a student tries to escape

372
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,100
like her in the future,

373
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,020
let them hang

374
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,500
and dry on the wall.

375
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,980
Alright.

376
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,100
No. 357.

377
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,140
I'm not done with you.

378
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,820
(Jinyu Tea Plantation, Anping Bridge)

379
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,380
What's the use of just looking?

380
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,260
Why not offer incense?

381
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,300
You know nothing.

382
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,300
Kan said Lu Tong loved tea
his whole life.

383
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,780
His Seven Bowls of Tea poem

384
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,100
is famous everywhere.

385
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,580
He was also a close friend

386
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,660
of Lu Yu, the Sage of Tea.

387
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,580
So...

388
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,160
So, I'm studying the poem.

389
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,940
Seven Bowls of Tea?

390
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,020
Recite it for me.

391
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,300
The first bowl moistens the throat.

392
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,740
The second bowl dispels loneliness.

393
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,020
The third bowl leads to deep thoughts.

394
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,500
Only voluminous books remain.

395
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,700
The fourth bowl brings light sweat,

396
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,580
driving all life's injustices

397
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,980
through the pores.

398
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,280
What about the fifth bowl?

399
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,620
The fifth clears the muscles and bones.

400
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,040
The sixth connects to the immortals.

401
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,200
The seventh is unbearable,

402
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,820
leaving only a breeze under the armpits.

403
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,980
Is that right?

404
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,500
Do you know it by heart?

405
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,680
You just got

406
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,500
the number of words right.

407
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
That poem is not long.

408
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,820
I'll memorize it sooner or later.

409
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,020
Alright, I wish you success.

410
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,580
But honestly,

411
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,060
why not look

412
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,620
at yourself instead?

413
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,980
You don't care about cleanliness, fine,

414
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,540
but at least try to keep yourself tidy.

415
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
Why are you nagging?

416
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,500
You just organize the shop, right?

417
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,140
All the heavy lifting and tea moving

418
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,780
are my jobs.

419
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,740
Listen.

420
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,260
You're guilty now.

421
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,180
Recognize your status.

422
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,140
I just scammed you
out of 100 taels of silver.

423
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,480
I never said I wouldn't return it.

424
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,300
Return it?

425
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,540
That isn't enough to atone.

426
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,140
Scammers get their karma.

427
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,700
Karma?

428
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,380
Listen, kid.

429
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,940
Karma is

430
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,380
just a weak person's

431
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,140
self-comforting idea.

432
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,300
Got it?

433
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,020
My Tao Baowen...

434
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,820
You can comfort yourself now.

435
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,180
Who is this?

436
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,180
Who put the abacus on the ground?

437
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,460
Is that true?

438
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,620
It's the scammer

439
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,900
who pretended
to be the Tea Master last time?

440
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,940
Right.

441
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,980
Mr. Wang said

442
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,860
he's now an employee

443
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,420
at the Anping Bridge Shop.

444
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Is that so?

445
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,260
You should meet

446
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,180
this impostor

447
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,100
and find out their connection.

448
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,140
If possible...

449
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,620
Eliminate him?

450
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,060
Make him work for me.

451
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,300
No, no.

452
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,700
How can this be "eliminate him"?

453
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,300
This is how I signal it.

454
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,500
Am I that evil?

455
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,700
Why would I want him dead?

456
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,700
Then make it clear.

457
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,700
Isn't it clear?

458
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,540
You're just silly.

459
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,380
Don't get angry.

460
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,420
Madam,

461
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,340
Jing Kan has

462
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,020
some backbone this time.

463
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,020
Our tea plantation never gave him tea,

464
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,200
and he didn't make a fuss.

465
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,300
He's learned his lesson.

466
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,860
Know making a scene won't help.

467
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,620
I heard from Mr. Wang

468
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,820
that he's been contacting

469
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,060
other tea plantations outside.

470
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,620
But the tea he received

471
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,940
is all second-rate stuff.

472
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,100
He's collecting tea?

473
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,660
Go ask Mr. Wang to check

474
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,180
if all his documents

475
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,100
are in order.

476
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,700
Yes.

477
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,300
(To Seclusion)
What did you say?

478
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,340
Wei Shuangxi was abandoned?

479
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,540
Yes.

480
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,180
Grandmother, that's not the key.

481
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,140
The key is

482
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,180
that Yuanyang House is abusing women.

483
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,700
We should report it

484
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,900
and save everyone.

485
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,020
Junyi.

486
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,180
Junyi, Junyi.

487
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,140
Watch her feet.

488
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,620
Junyi, save me!

489
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Save me, Junyi!

490
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,900
What happened?

491
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,180
Aunt,

492
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,140
how did you end up like this?

493
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,420
Ai Sixi.

494
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,060
You...

495
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,420
Ms. Wei.

496
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,820
What...?

497
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,020
Always serving everyone.

498
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,380
Everyone here
is treating me like a maid.

499
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,220
Jiao'e, should I help?

500
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,840
Why didn't you come earlier?

501
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,820
I've almost finished.

502
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,060
Pour water.

503
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Has her fever gone down?

504
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,140
Ai Sixi.

505
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,060
What?

506
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,260
Ai Sixi, Ai Sixi.

507
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,920
Ai Sixi?

508
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:26,007
Ai Sixi...

509
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,500
Why are you calling her?

510
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,220
Could they have become friends

511
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,020
in Yuanyang House?

512
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,080
They might've met there?

513
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,980
She and Ai Sixi are friends?

514
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,360
So, she must be no good.

515
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,260
Stop calling.

516
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,660
Stop, stop.

517
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,780
Jiao'e,

518
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,180
this is the Old Lady's aunt.

519
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,300
Respect the seniority.

520
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,480
Anyway, no one's watching.

521
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,820
I didn't say it.

522
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,340
Ms. Wei.

523
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,260
Ms. Wei, you're awake.

524
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,700
Ai...

525
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,460
Sixi.

526
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,140
Yes, you kept calling her name just now.

527
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,740
Did you need her for something?

528
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,700
You two really have

529
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,900
a strong bond.

530
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,980
Such a strong bond.

531
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,100
She's my mortal enemy.

532
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,500
Ms. Wei?

533
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,100
She's still alive.

534
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,020
Hurry, let's go.

535
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,900
(Fu's Restaurant)

536
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,620
May I ask...

537
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,060
Forget it, you probably don't know.

538
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,020
You look familiar.

539
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,700
Familiar (cooked)?

540
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,660
I've never been burned by boiling water.

541
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,820
How could I be cooked?

542
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,820
A common face.

543
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,020
Are you the one

544
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,180
who called me mother that day?

545
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
No, no, no.

546
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,580
No.

547
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,180
What brings you here?

548
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,580
Please sit.

549
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,260
I heard you scammed
our Baita Bridge Shop

550
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,320
out of 50 taels of silver.

551
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,740
Is that true?

552
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,020
I was just

553
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,260
trying to train your employees

554
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,700
for free

555
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,180
to raise their awareness
of getting scammed.

556
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,360
Listen.

557
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,300
You can fool around
with Jing Kan and his group,

558
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,820
and they might trust you, but I won't.

559
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,740
We have connections at the yamen.

560
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,980
Fifty taels of silver

561
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,380
would be enough to lock you up for life.

562
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,340
No, no.

563
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,780
We just agreed nicely before.

564
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,700
Why are you doing this?

565
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Before I came,

566
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,380
Mr. Wang already threatened me.

567
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,860
Alright, tell me what you want.

568
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,620
I want you to be our spy.

569
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,780
Spy?

570
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,540
Who should I spy on?

571
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,940
Jing Kan and his group.

572
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,460
What's so special about them?

573
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,100
Not your concern.

574
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,060
Just report all their movements

575
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,620
to me.

576
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,140
Actually,
I was just about to tell you this.

577
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,460
I don't plan

578
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,940
to work there anymore.

579
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,900
Why?

580
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,300
You see.

581
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,260
It's no place for a human to stay.

582
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,620
What do you mean?

583
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,780
Come here.

584
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,620
Sit here.

585
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,980
Let me explain slowly.

586
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,380
Those people...

587
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,460
You wouldn't know.

588
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,860
They won't achieve anything.

589
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,140
Look at them. The chief has no vision.

590
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,580
The manager has no integrity.

591
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,640
The shop is disorganized.

592
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,100
How am I supposed to do my job?

593
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,740
Right.

594
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,780
Do you know the most important thing
in business?

595
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,340
Good people, high-quality goods,

596
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,180
and a clean shop.

597
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,900
They?

598
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,660
The people are useless,
the goods are poor,

599
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,600
and the shop is dirty.

600
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,580
They're mad, too.

601
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Why spy on them?

602
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,940
It's completely unnecessary.

603
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,140
They're a bunch of riffraff.

604
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,820
Listen, listen to me.

605
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,340
Ignore them, forget about them.

606
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,660
Their shop will close down soon.

607
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,580
The day they close,
I'll notify you personally.

608
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,620
That's it.

609
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,540
Stop.

610
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,300
This, this...

611
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,020
You almost convinced me.

612
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,740
I've heard enough.

613
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,140
I'm here to notify you.

614
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,460
Without my order,

615
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,060
do not leave the Anping Bridge Shop.

616
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,180
We have spies at all four gates

617
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,380
of Taiping County.

618
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,700
If you dare run,

619
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,300
don't blame me for being ruthless.

620
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,220
Let's go.

621
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,900
Darn it, she remembered.

622
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,900
No...

623
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,900
What's happening?

624
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,820
I can't leave now?

625
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,780
I'll leave anyway and see what happens.

626
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,980
I don't believe it.

627
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,580
I don't believe
there's someone more upset than me.

628
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,340
This poem is so good.

629
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,740
Who wrote this?

630
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,940
(Carefree and Relaxed)

631
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,580
When did you come here as a maid?

632
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,100
If someone else asked me that,

633
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,820
I'd be angry.

634
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,140
Actually, I'm not a maid here.

635
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,140
Then what are you here for?

636
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
Actually...

637
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,780
I...

638
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,740
I'll soon marry

639
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,620
a wealthy young master.

640
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,460
But right now, my status is

641
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,580
somewhat embarrassing.

642
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,260
Enough of that.

643
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,540
Ms. Wei,

644
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,820
how did Ai Sixi

645
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,980
anger you?

646
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,100
Ai Sixi?

647
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,740
Do you know how badly she screwed me up

648
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,860
at Yuanyang House?

649
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,940
Tell me.

650
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,820
Why did Jing Kan take a liking to her?

651
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,780
Let me tell you.

652
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,300
Ai Sixi is just a climber.

653
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,100
She faked a pregnancy to marry Jing Kan.

654
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,140
Jing Kan is always

655
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,380
so naive.

656
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,020
She trapped him just like that.

657
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,420
Jing Kan is a fool.

658
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420
Yes. Ai Sixi is just a cook,

659
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,940
doing nothing and lazing around

660
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,780
at home all day.

661
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
What did you say she was?

662
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,520
A cook.

663
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,380
A cook?

664
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,620
She ran a gambling house.

665
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,860
Gambling house? Really?

666
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,780
Really.

667
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,500
No wonder.

668
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,780
I've always had a shadow

669
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,020
of doubt in my heart.

670
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,100
Every time she has delicious food,

671
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,020
she acts

672
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,380
like she's never seen the world.

673
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,060
You can tell she's not a cook.

674
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,780
Also, last time, Auntie asked her

675
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,980
which flavor Kan prefers, the salty one

676
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,100
or the sweet and sour one.

677
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,520
She didn't know anything.

678
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,420
Because she was not a cook.

679
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,460
She ran a gambling house.

680
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,820
Does Wei Junyi know about this?

681
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,740
Wei Jun...

682
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,220
What does the Old Lady

683
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,820
even know?

684
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,300
The Old Lady only protects her,

685
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
treating donkey dung

686
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,580
like a treasure.

687
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,740
The Jings hate gambling.

688
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,380
Her eldest son used to gamble.

689
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,300
Gambling is a taboo word.

690
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,620
No.

691
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,140
I have to tell the Old Lady.

692
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,260
Wait.

693
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,740
We mustn't expose her.

694
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,940
Why not?

695
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,980
If we expose her,

696
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,100
the game will be over.

697
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,740
Game?

698
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,860
What game?

699
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,660
Cat and mouse.

700
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Cat and mouse?

701
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,020
The fun for the cat to catch the mouse

702
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,940
isn't to kill it,

703
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,380
but to make its life worse than death.

704
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,540
You mean

705
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,140
we should play with her and have fun?

706
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,860
She's a cook, isn't she?

707
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,820
We'll let her fulfill her duties as one.

708
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,220
Drink your medicine.

709
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,180
Still sleeping?

710
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,860
You surely enjoy sleeping.

711
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,220
You scared me.

712
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,580
Kan has been

713
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,060
at the shop for quite a while.

714
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,700
You surely know how to enjoy yourself.

715
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,260
What's up?

716
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,460
Tell me then.

717
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,700
Afterwards, help me
with some face-washing water.

718
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
I...

719
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,980
Please.

720
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,580
I just came

721
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,220
to notify you.

722
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,820
Ms. Wei...

723
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,540
What happened to her?

724
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,620
Why are you nervous?

725
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,740
I'm nervous?

726
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,780
I'm worried

727
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,380
she's not well yet.

728
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,980
Are you worried she's not well,

729
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,060
or that she is?

730
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,940
I...

731
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,500
She's fine.

732
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,100
She's fine?

733
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,500
How nice. Then?

734
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,780
Then she said,

735
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,020
since you're a cook,

736
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,380
and you know her,

737
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,980
she hopes you can cook a meal for her.

738
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,220
Cook a meal?

739
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,700
Did you tell her I'm a cook?

740
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,820
Yes.

741
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,460
You said it yourself

742
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,460
that you're a cook.

743
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,300
What? Shouldn't I tell her?

744
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,020
Why are you mad?

745
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,140
I didn't say anything.

746
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Ms. Wei also said

747
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,020
you should feed her personally.

748
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Is she paralyzed?

749
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,500
The Old Lady agreed, too.

750
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,740
I knew No. 132

751
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,540
would get back at me.

752
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
What did you say?

753
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,500
I said thank you for your kindness.

754
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,380
- I...
- Go back

755
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,340
and tell her to wait.

756
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,820
I'll cook a proper meal for her.

757
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,260
Okay, I'll wait in the kitchen.

758
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,820
Please.

759
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,300
(Anping Bridge, Jinyu Tea)

760
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,660
Good people get bullied.

761
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,940
Good horses get ridden.

762
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,220
I just fooled a few people.

763
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,020
Do they all have to target me?

764
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,620
Who is that?

765
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,100
Who drank wine from a teacup?

766
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,220
Noodles?

767
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,380
What kind of people

768
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,300
are these?

769
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,580
Whatever.

770
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,940
Whatever.

771
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,100
Out of sight, out of mind.

772
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,980
Out of sight, out of mind.

773
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,740
I can't stand it.

774
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,460
I'll wash you all to death.

775
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,180
I'll wash you to death!

776
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:42,380
(Fragrant and Ethereal)

777
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,940
What kind of people are these?

778
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,180
So dirty.

779
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,700
People would be lucky to survive.

780
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,580
I can't take it.

781
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,500
Go!

782
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,860
These animals!

783
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,460
Animals!

784
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,060
I'll clean everything!

785
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,020
Wipe!

786
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,300
Wipe, wipe, wipe!

787
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,380
Wipe!

788
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,740
I'm wiping!

789
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,100
There's incense.

790
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,460
Why not use it to pay respects?

791
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,340
Stop blowing, stop it!

792
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,260
Stop it.

793
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,660
Come on.

794
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,820
Why blow when I said don't?

795
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,940
No one's here.

796
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,060
Why light so many candles?

797
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,940
Are you cold?

798
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,900
Do you know how to run a shop?

799
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,460
Even if no customers come,

800
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,980
this place has to be bright.

801
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,580
Who'd come to a dark place?

802
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,660
Is this an illegal shop,

803
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,860
dealing with the dead?

804
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,780
Alright, alright.

805
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,740
Always so mad.

806
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,260
But it's true

807
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,420
that ever since Guiwei came,

808
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,940
the shop's been much cleaner.

809
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,980
Guiwei?

810
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,620
I cleaned it! It was me!

811
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,820
Come on. Does any of you know

812
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,260
what they're doing?

813
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,300
Look at the shop layout,

814
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,140
the environment,

815
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
the tea sets,

816
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,180
and the painting.

817
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,180
How can you run a shop like this?

818
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,140
I know a bit about tea,

819
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,700
but running the shop

820
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,420
depends on you and Guiwei.

821
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,940
Guiwei, Guiwei.

822
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,900
Listen to me.

823
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,420
Tell Guiwei

824
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,500
to eat inside from now on.

825
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,900
He's got a sieve for a mouth.

826
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,060
Look at this dirty table.

827
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,860
It's clean to me.

828
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,380
Because I wiped it!

829
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,740
No wonder Mr. An recommended you.

830
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,300
You're quite capable.

831
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,180
I'm furious.

832
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,340
I'm the only capable one.
What's the use?

833
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,980
Listen, your shop

834
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,220
(Fragrant and Ethereal)
deserves to close.

835
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,460
Come on.

836
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,540
Why are you so angry?

837
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,420
Am I angry?

838
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,380
Am I?

839
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
Listen, I've been lenient with you.

840
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,820
Well, I have

841
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,220
to go meet a tea merchant.

842
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,100
Guiwei will come back
with Indocalamus leaves.

843
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,700
Check if they're dry.

844
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,860
No need to tell me that.

845
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,780
Also, the rice cake soup is for you.

846
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,740
Drink some

847
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,420
and calm your anger.

848
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,460
How nice.

849
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,680
No need to get worked up.

850
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,100
No need.

851
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
How could you forget the spoon?

852
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,820
I don't know what to say.

853
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,660
Is Guiwei

854
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
an animal?

855
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,380
He doesn't even wash up after eating.

856
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,260
Even animals are better than him.

857
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,660
I can sell the meat after killing.

858
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,060
Just as I imagined.

859
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Kan must think

860
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,780
I work too hard,

861
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,800
so he bought this for me.

862
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,440
Having a cousin-in-law is great.

863
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,760
(Fragrant and Ethereal)

864
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,380
These people are all idiots.

865
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,180
Where's my soup?

866
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,420
Where's my soup?

867
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,700
I...
