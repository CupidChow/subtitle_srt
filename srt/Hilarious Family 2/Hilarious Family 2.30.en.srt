Are you really going
to compile the Book of New Tea?

26
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,750
Yeah. According to Ruan Ling,

27
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,780
when it's still warm enough,

28
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,060
we can record the differences

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,010
of tea trees in different places.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,080
That's what he said.

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,500
Fine. I support you.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,040
Here are some peaches for your trip.

33
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,330
Shuangxi.

34
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,550
I've found this.

35
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,650
What is this?

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,670
It's my Wufang beans.

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,800
I eat them when drinking.

38
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,680
What if I can't buy any elsewhere?

39
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,560
This is my favorite.

40
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,520
And this is my favorite.

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,380
I'll enjoy it.

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,290
Ruan.

43
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,450
It's always cold in tea hills.

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,240
These clothes are for you.

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,400
I wore them in person.

46
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,110
Guiwei,

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,770
how could you give him your old clothes?

48
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,490
But I washed them.

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,180
I'm thinking when you're out there

50
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,170
in the wild,

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,610
some durable clothes

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,210
will be comfortable and economical.

53
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,280
Thank you, Guiwei.

54
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,520
Thank you, Guiwei.

55
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,210
Who's the manager?

56
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,010
Go, Guiwei.

57
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,270
I am.

58
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,150
Do you want some tea?

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,050
We have Anzhou Sweetie.

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Don't touch that.

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,860
Who are you?

62
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,180
At the order of Chief Jing,

63
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,120
I'll take over the shop.

64
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,110
Chief Jing? Who?

65
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,720
Chief Jing Nanfeng of Jinyu Tea.

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,170
Jing Nanfeng?

67
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,290
What do you want?

68
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,770
I'll go get the constables.

69
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,070
This land

70
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,520
belongs to Chief Jing.

71
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,840
You want the constables? Go ahead.

72
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,120
You...

73
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,930
I've made my point.

74
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,300
Be wise enough,

75
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,620
get packed, and leave.

76
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,560
What's all this about?

77
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,350
Chief Jing failed to reason things out,

78
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,490
so he will snatch it, huh?

79
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,610
Come on.

80
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,230
It's the Jing's title deed.

81
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,900
Jing Kan is the eldest grandson.

82
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,270
Since when does Jing Nanfeng
own this alone?

83
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,270
Ridiculous.

84
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,680
I've made my point.

85
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,170
If you still don't leave,

86
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,070
I'll have to make you leave.

87
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,680
Hilarious.

88
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,000
It's five of you

89
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,330
and it's five of us.

90
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,800
You don't scare us.

91
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,960
Move.

92
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,490
If you still stay,

93
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,720
we'll make you leave.

94
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,050
You really are unappreciative.

95
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,130
What are you waiting for?

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,110
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,050
Get moving.

98
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,110
When did I say

99
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,210
it was only five of us?

100
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,160
Can we make you leave now?

101
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,260
Looks like you will

102
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,500
have a fight with us.

103
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,720
We don't fight one-on-one.

104
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,920
All right. We won't fight one-on-one.

105
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,960
In this world,

106
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,280
everybody has a backer.

107
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,890
Threaten me, huh?

108
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,160
Let me see who your backer is.

109
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,930
Don't do anything brave.

110
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,560
Get down here.

111
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,610
You

112
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,690
and every single one of you.

113
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,720
Stay here if you dare.

114
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,520
Do bring back someone.

115
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,490
Let's sit and wait.

116
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,490
Where did Ruan Ling go?

117
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,210
Why isn't he back yet?

118
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,920
Did he run away?

119
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,400
Have faith in him.

120
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,400
The point is, who has he gone to?

121
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,480
I gave you an opportunity.

122
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,790
And I guess that guy

123
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,840
just ran away.

124
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,080
- Buddies.
- Here!

125
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,200
Smash!

126
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,090
Let me remind you.

127
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,110
If you smash things,

128
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,210
you'll have to pay.

129
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,320
Smash!

130
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,680
I dare you!

131
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,620
Wait, wait!

132
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,450
- Stop smashing.
- Stop. Stop.

133
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,360
Stop!

134
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,880
Where's your backer?

135
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,050
Mr. Long Er,

136
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,470
when did you come out?

137
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,500
Thanks to Jing Kan,

138
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,600
I came out last month.

139
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,650
So, you bullied Jing Kan, huh?

140
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,230
No.

141
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,520
How dare you?

142
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,040
Buddies.

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
- Here!
- Here!

144
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,360
Move.

145
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,930
Don't.

146
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,380
Spare me, Mr. Long Er.

147
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,690
How dare you smash our shop?

148
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,760
See?

149
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,130
I warned you.

150
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,650
You hit them hard. Let them go.

151
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,240
Wait.

152
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,570
Who sent you?

153
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,860
Mr. Long Er,

154
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,040
I'm a mere minion.

155
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,300
Don't embarrass me.

156
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,240
Let me go.

157
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,330
Confess. Who sent you?

158
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,250
Come on. Move aside.

159
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,560
Make way.

160
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,770
And you guys, move aside.

161
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,860
- Mr. Wang.
- Mr. Wang?

162
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,890
Take it easy.

163
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,030
Mr. Wang.

164
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,970
Mr. Wang, help.

165
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,050
Mr. Wang, help me.

166
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,690
You're so bruised
that I can hardly recognize you.

167
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,180
Didn't I tell you to negotiate?

168
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,330
Why did it end up like this?

169
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,350
Sit down.

170
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,290
Mr. Wang.

171
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,600
Nice to meet you, Jing Kan.

172
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,210
Chief Jing

173
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,040
gave an instruction.

174
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,110
If you insist

175
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,480
on keeping this shop...

176
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,600
Come on, give me the deed.

177
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,650
You can buy this deed

178
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,570
with 500 taels.

179
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,650
500 taels?

180
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,840
This is robbery.

181
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,760
The shop next door costs 200 taels.

182
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,020
Then, buy the shop next door.

183
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,960
You...

184
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,840
Wang,

185
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,960
you worked for Chief Luo, didn't you?

186
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,990
Since when are you

187
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,360
Jing Nanfeng's minion?

188
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,720
Don't ask me that.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,660
Since I'm here,

190
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,620
you give me the money,

191
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,170
or I will take over the shop.

192
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,960
Make your choice.

193
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,930
I notified the constable.

194
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,930
Why does nobody talk?

195
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,570
I'll take over the shop, then.

196
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,120
Move. Take over the shop.

197
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,250
Help them.

198
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,650
I dare you.

199
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,410
Who said they didn't have money?

200
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,890
Donglin.

201
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,680
Donglin?

202
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,290
I'll pay 500 taels

203
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,120
on their behalf.

204
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,720
Donglin.

205
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,190
He was drunk

206
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,290
and went to bed.

207
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,410
Don't worry. He's fine.

208
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,090
I totally understand

209
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,450
when he doesn't forgive me.

210
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,410
It's not your fault.

211
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
You didn't have a choice.

212
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
That man is to blame.

213
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,690
He's heartless

214
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,960
and he betrayed you.

215
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,330
That year,

216
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,210
I could have chosen to bring him up

217
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,170
instead of getting married.

218
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,860
As his mother,

219
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm guilty.

220
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,250
All right.

221
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,690
All these years,

222
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,810
you've been making arrangements for him.

223
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,570
You've done all that you could.

224
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,780
I just hope

225
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,900
he won't hate me forever.

226
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,540
Give him some time.

227
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,420
He will think it through.

228
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,540
All right. You go back.

229
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,060
I'll take care of him.

230
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,020
I'll keep you informed.

231
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,940
Let me take care of him.

232
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,900
Madam.

233
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,020
Madam.

234
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,140
What are you doing here?

235
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,460
Chief Luo,

236
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,660
we know you have a family business.

237
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
But anyway,

238
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,940
Jing Nanfeng must not

239
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
take charge of Jinyu Tea.

240
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,780
He's a villainous hypocrite

241
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,260
and he's weak in business.

242
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,540
In his hands,

243
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,020
Jinyu Tea will just collapse.

244
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,540
Madam,

245
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,180
the other day, Jing Nanfeng said

246
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,940
he would get a rite for his father

247
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,140
and lured Old Lady to the temple.

248
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,980
Now, Old Lady isn't at home.

249
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,300
Everybody is fearful.

250
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,340
You should come out and take charge.

251
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,420
Yeah. You must take charge.

252
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,540
I've made up my mind.

253
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,300
I would rather be a mother

254
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,660
than a chief manager.

255
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
You should go back.

256
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,580
(Spring Breeze)

257
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,020
You're drunk again.

258
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,820
Did you throw the things

259
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,740
out of Zhusi's room?

260
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,020
Isn't it inappropriate?

261
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Why is it inappropriate?

262
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,380
Did you also send gangsters

263
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,180
to Jing Kan's shop?

264
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,980
Yes.

265
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
You're going too far!

266
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,820
I'm not.

267
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,340
In this family,

268
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,180
nobody sees me

269
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,820
as the real master.

270
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,420
Nobody sees me as the chief manager.

271
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,700
Nobody thinks highly of me.

272
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,460
Stop drinking.

273
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,380
You're drunk.

274
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,180
Stop it!

275
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,220
Is there more wine?

276
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,140
No, no.

277
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,540
I'll go buy some.

278
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,900
Where are you going?

279
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,100
Don't go.

280
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,900
You're already drunk.

281
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,900
Don't go. You...

282
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Listen!

283
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,780
Stop nagging.

284
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,940
I can do whatever I want to do.

285
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,700
Do you hear?

286
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,060
Jing Nanfeng, let go of her!

287
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,740
Zhenzhu,

288
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,940
you also fight your father, huh?

289
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,700
I shouldn't have cared for you.

290
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,020
You never care for me.

291
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,540
I warn you!

292
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm no longer a kid.

293
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,260
You'd better stay away!

294
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,540
You've grown up.

295
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,220
Good. You've grown up.

296
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,500
Have a drink with me.

297
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,380
Drink with me

298
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,260
and I will forgive you.

299
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,420
Come on.

300
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
I don't want to drink.

301
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,140
Zhenzhu.

302
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,180
She said she didn't want to drink.

303
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,860
Who are you?

304
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm Zhenzhu's husband.

305
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,540
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

306
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,380
Donglin.

307
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,860
Donglin.

308
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,340
You're bleeding.

309
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,740
Funny.

310
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,620
Protect her?

311
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,740
Wait and see.

312
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,860
- Let me...
- Jing Nanfeng.

313
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,940
(Pure and Pretty)

314
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,660
Sober up, man.

315
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,660
Ai Sixi,

316
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,780
what do you want?

317
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm here to make you pay.

318
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,020
For what?

319
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,660
You sent those gangsters

320
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,620
to our shop, right?

321
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,260
Yes. So what?

322
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,260
I'm telling you.

323
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,620
I am...

324
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
The master of this family.

325
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm the chief manager.

326
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,860
And I'm your senior.

327
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,460
I taught you a lesson, so what?

328
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,900
If you behave, it's all right.

329
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,750
If you don't behave,

330
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,700
I won't care.

331
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,900
You're just an encumbrance.

332
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,660
Jing Nanfeng, I warn you.

333
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,620
In this family,

334
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,260
someone will always fix you.

335
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,740
Who?

336
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,540
You?

337
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,620
Just you wait.

338
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,020
Protect my daughter, huh? Wait and see.

339
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,020
Are... Are you all right?

340
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
I'm fine.

341
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,300
Are you sure?

342
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
In this case,

343
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,100
why didn't you fight?

344
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,100
I'm going now.

345
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,020
No, no.

346
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,940
No need.

347
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,860
Leave him to me.

348
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,780
Go.

349
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,340
- He needs a doctor.
- Oh, right.

350
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,260
Thank you.

351
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,620
Thank you.

352
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,300
Doctor, how is she?

353
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,420
You came too late.

354
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,580
Her disease dragged on too long.

355
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,620
Now, no physician in this world

356
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,220
will be able to save her.

357
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,580
But you're the great physician.

358
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,460
Yunzhu.

359
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,180
It's all right.

360
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,260
Physician,

361
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,980
how much time do I have?

362
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,060
Well...

363
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,060
If you stay here

364
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,500
and take medicine every day,

365
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,740
you may live for a month or two.

366
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,740
A month or two?

367
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,460
If you have unfinished business,

368
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,420
hurry up about it.

369
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,020
Youyou.

370
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,180
Yunzhu, let's go.

371
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,580
Youyou, where are we going?

372
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,260
I'm going to see Sixi.

373
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,100
You can't go.

374
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,460
You're not strong enough

375
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,380
for a long trip.

376
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,260
If I weren't supporting you

377
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,420
with the acupuncture,

378
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,220
you wouldn't even last

379
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,580
for half a month.

380
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,900
Youyou,

381
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,500
let's obey Physician Wei.

382
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,740
In my life,

383
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,060
I only obey my own will.

384
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,460
I'm a lucky woman.

385
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,940
I'm going to see Sixi one last time.

386
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,460
Look what you've done.

387
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,260
You promised to go to the temple with me

388
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,820
for your father's rite.

389
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,060
But what happened?

390
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
You sent me away

391
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,140
and did such foolish things

392
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,980
at home.

393
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,020
Mother,

394
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

395
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,460
You don't know?

396
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,980
You smashed Jing Kan's shop, right?

397
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,580
You threw out Zhusi's stuff, right?

398
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,340
In your room,

399
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,580
you punched

400
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,740
your wife and your daughter,

401
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
right?

402
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,700
What are you going to do next?

403
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,140
Will you take me out

404
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,180
and bury me?

405
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,300
Mother,

406
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,700
I smashed his shop

407
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,340
just to collect all the shops

408
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,820
for unified management.

409
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,420
That day, I quarreled with Muyun

410
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,340
because I was drunk.

411
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
Before Luo Zhusi

412
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,300
married my brother,

413
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,100
she lost her virtue.

414
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,260
And it was her

415
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,140
who restrained me on Qiongzhou Island

416
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,180
from coming back home.

417
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,740
She did the right thing!

418
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,380
When she restrained you,

419
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,620
why did you not escape?

420
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,540
Mother,

421
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm doing all this

422
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,900
for our family.

423
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,460
For our family?

424
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,980
Do you even care for this family?

425
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,900
Mother,

426
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,260
you also didn't want me back, right?

427
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,140
When you just came back,

428
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,260
I fantasized about something.

429
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,300
I thought

430
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,220
if you changed for the better,

431
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,500
you could also

432
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,460
take over this family.

433
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,940
But now, it seems

434
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,900
I'm muddle-headed

435
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,860
and have a foolish fantasy.

436
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,780
Mother,

437
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,700
I'm your son.

438
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,740
This family

439
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,820
is supposed to be mine.

440
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,940
Wrong.

441
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,340
This family

442
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,620
belongs to who truly defends it.

443
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,260
Mother,

444
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,260
I'm your only son now.

445
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Don't forget.

446
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,420
I'm your son.

447
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,660
My blood is yours.

448
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,420
Only you and I

449
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,780
are a really family.

450
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,660
Blood is thicker than water.

451
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,180
But blood doesn't mean love.

452
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,260
Some people's blood is hot

453
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,900
while some people's blood is cold!

454
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
I'm telling you!

455
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,070
In this world,

456
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,940
something's even thicker than blood!

457
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,340
Why are you saying this to me?

458
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,180
I don't care at all.

459
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,860
You even help outsiders

460
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,820
instead of me.

461
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,780
At the clan meeting,

462
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,260
you didn't vote for me, either.

463
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,900
Don't bother to say this to me.

464
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,700
You're hopeless.

465
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,660
Right. I'm hopeless.

466
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,220
Since I was little, you and Father

467
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,140
both thought my brother

468
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,420
was the best in this family

469
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,340
and I was your burden.

470
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,620
I was superfluous.

471
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,740
I would just be a playboy.

472
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,820
Very well. Now, I am one.

473
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,700
I am the playboy.

474
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,260
So what?

475
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,740
Get out!

476
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,460
Mother,

477
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,660
you're old.

478
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,380
You'd better take care of yourself.

479
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,060
Don't worry about things

480
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,180
you shouldn't bother.

481
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,820
Leave those things

482
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,660
to me.

483
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,220
Somebody.

484
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,620
Here.

485
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,660
Watch over her.

486
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,260
Youyou,

488
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,020
are you all right?

489
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,420
I'm fine.

490
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,220
Why do you have to do this?

491
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
We can

492
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,180
ask Sixi to come here.

493
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,460
She has her family

494
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,700
and her business.

495
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,140
I won't waste her time.

496
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,980
Youyou, have some water.

497
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,860
Are you all right, Youyou?

498
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,900
- Yes.
- Sir, stop.

499
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,100
Stop.

500
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,420
No. Don't stop.

501
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,180
Youyou, if you remain so stubborn,

502
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,380
I'm afraid you can't even see Sixi

503
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,420
one last time.

504
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,220
I'll go get her to you.

505
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,460
You must not continue.

506
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,740
Looks like

507
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,860
I'm not lucky enough.

508
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
Stop talking.

509
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,180
Come on, Youyou.

510
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,420
Lean on me and rest.

511
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,780
Sir,

512
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,380
turn back now.

513
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,700
(Jinyu Tea Plantation
Anping Bridge Shop)

514
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,340
Shuangxi,

515
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,660
I had great difficulty finding this.

516
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,460
Ruan Ling, it's yours now.

517
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,580
Take care of yourself.

518
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,660
Rest assured, buddy.

519
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,580
You take care, too.

520
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,420
Ruan, hope you'll come back soon.

521
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,820
Don't be so impatient.

522
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,860
You are still

523
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,340
the manager of this shop.

524
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,500
I need you.

525
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,580
What for?

526
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,460
To teach me something about love.

527
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,660
Jiao'e seems to be softened.

528
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
All right. I hope

529
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
we'll hear your good news

530
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,500
when we're back.

531
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,260
We should go.

532
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,700
Have a nice trip.

533
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,180
Sixi.

534
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,980
- We should go.
- All right.

535
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,940
Let's go.

536
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,500
I should go.

537
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,580
All right.

538
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,180
- Take care.
- No. 357.

539
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,740
Oh, this.

540
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,700
I'll take it.

541
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,330
- Take care.
- We will.

542
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,560
Be careful.

543
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,220
Bye. Take care.

544
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,140
We will be back.

545
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,100
Write to us.

546
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,940
Come back soon.

547
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,900
All right.

548
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,620
When they're gone,

549
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
it's so quiet

550
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,940
and I'm not used to that.

551
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,580
Think about it differently.

552
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,100
Maybe it's a good thing.

553
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,940
At least, everyone has something to do.

554
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,420
Sixi, Kan,

555
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,500
you still have me.

556
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,900
I will be a good manager.

557
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,420
Be smart, then.

558
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,340
Don't slack off.

559
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,300
I know.

560
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,420
Oh, what is the new name

561
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,340
of our shop?

562
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,740
I have an idea.

563
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,180
Youming Tea Shop.

564
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,180
Kan, think of another one.

565
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,500
That's a good name, I think.

566
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,940
Really?

567
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,660
Don't say that

568
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,520
just to make me happy.

569
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,420
I'm serious.

570
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,980
I think this name

571
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,660
sounds pleasant and big.

572
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,180
I like whatever you suggest.

573
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,460
That's it, then.

574
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,860
I wish I could leave with them.

575
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,940
Sixi.

576
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,580
Yunzhu?

577
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,980
Are you saying

578
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,940
my mother picked a house

579
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,260
and wanted me to check it?

580
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,740
Yes.

581
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,340
Why would she want

582
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,380
to settle down?

583
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,340
You persuaded her?

584
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,420
It's her own idea.

585
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,660
Where is the house?

586
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,860
Near Songlan Mountain.

587
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,940
That's a good place.

588
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,700
I've heard it's surrounded
by beautiful mountains.

589
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,660
It's even near the sea.

590
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
Weird.

591
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,100
My mother is addicted to shopping.

592
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,420
How could she live near a mountain?

593
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,180
People change.

594
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,900
Let's not waste time.

595
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,180
Let's go check on her.

596
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,500
In this case,

597
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,460
you should just go.

598
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,860
Bring more money

599
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,340
and buy a big house for Mother.

600
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,580
Yeah, Sixi.

601
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,860
You don't need to rush back.

602
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,180
Kan and I are here.

603
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,100
The shop will be fine.

604
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,260
My mother

605
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,260
is so wayward.

606
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,980
Fine. I'll go in a couple of days.

607
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,660
The carriage is ready.

608
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,660
Let's go now.

609
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,420
Now?

610
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,260
What kind of house

611
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,500
has fascinated my mother?

612
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,700
It's... It's big.

613
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,340
Wait. You must be hiding something.

614
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,980
Is my mother all right?

615
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,220
What happened to her?

616
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,980
Sixi.

617
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,660

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,260
Zhenzhu, wait.

643
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,900
What's wrong?

644
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,820
Nothing.

645
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,740
I just bumped it.

646
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,700
Let me see.

647
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,660
No.

648
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,780
It's all right.

649
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,940
I just bumped it.

650
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,860
What do I have to say

651
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,780
before you understand?

652
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,500
My point is...

653
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
Your shop

654
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,420
needs helpers.

655
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,940
When you're away,

656
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,140
your shop assistants
can't handle many cases.

657
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,140
What matters most to me

658
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,060
is you and our family.

659
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,180
If this family breaks up,

660
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,380
what do I need that shop for?

661
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,740
It will be useless.

662
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,460
Donglin,

663
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,940
under such circumstances,

664
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,380
I am

665
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,740
of no value to you.

666
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,620
Everybody knows that.

667
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,260
So, we don't need to argue.

668
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,860
Listen, Zhenzhu.

669
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,820
- Don't say anything.
- Let me finish.

670
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,020
You don't need to say anything.

671
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,180
Listen to me!

672
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,780
Zhenzhu.

673
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,860
I know what you experienced.

674
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,180
Your father gave you

675
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,700
a terrible childhood.

676
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,660
I know you suffered.

677
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,940
But it can't make you

678
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,620
give up on yourself.

679
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,940
I think one can do anything

680
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,980
unless he's dead.

681
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,900
Nothing really matters.

682
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,180
Don't give up on yourself.

683
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,980
Because I will never give up on you.

684
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,820
I will always protect you

685
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,740
and take care of you

686
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,700
until you can face yourself

687
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,180
and accept yourself.

688
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,380
And accept the love from us.

689
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,860
You should know

690
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,460
there aren't conditions for being loved.

691
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,780
But I can no longer get involved

692
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,220
in your life.

693
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,740
Like you said,

694
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,260
all I can do is hit you and scold you.

695
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,220
But you have to defend me all the time,

696
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,660
which is exhausting.

697
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,580
What exactly can you get from that?

00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,460

712
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,580

an outsider like me

716
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,660
shouldn't gossip

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,580
about your family.

718
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,580
But your uncle

719
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,620
has been outrageous.

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,380

Under the circumstances,

726
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,060
there's something

came from this poem, huh?

737
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,460
You know my mother's poem?

738
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,220
