Let's go.

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,470
- Let me.
- Thanks.

Sixi.

Sixi!

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,950
Sir, stop the carriage.

36
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,350
Sixi!

37
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,860
Guiwei.

38
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,170
What is it?

39
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,790
Sixi, Kan is in trouble.

40
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,770
What happened?

41
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,700
He was thrown

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,640
into jail.

43
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,870
Sir, please tell Yu

44
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,070
I won't go to Suzhou for now.

45
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,050
Sorry to trouble him.

46
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,470
What about your luggage?

47
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,280
Put it at Anping Bridge.

48
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,170
Anping Bridge?

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,500
(Jail)

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,990
What sin did I commit

51
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,020
in my past life?

52
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,680
Why do I have to meet you guys?

53
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,070
If I don't sell tea,

54
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,170
you will throw me in prison.

55
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,610
Fine, I sell tea,

56
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,190
but I still end up here with you.

57
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,170
Lower your voice.

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,070
Stop posing.

59
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,190
Think of a way.

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,170
I'm thinking now.

61
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,240
He's here. Be quick.

62
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,170
Thanks, Xia.

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,800
Sixi.

64
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,470
Guiwei.

65
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,450
Sixi.

66
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,380
Thanks, Advisor Xia.

67
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,370
Are you all right?

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,370
I didn't expect things
to turn out like this.

69
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,980
Kan,

70
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,120
are you hurt?

71
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,720
Get me out of here.

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,210
At least you're not hurt.

73
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,890
Guiwei, Guiwei.

74
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,910
Kan,

75
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,930
did they torture you?

76
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,640
Alright. Here.

77
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,680
There's no food here,

78
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,730
so we brought some food.

79
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,140
Come on.

80
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,120
You...

81
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,580
What on earth happened?

82
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,800
How did you get arrested?

83
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,970
A customer reported us
for not having a tea permit.

84
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,050
Tea permit?

85
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,470
I'm so mad about it.

86
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,540
You don't have a tea permit

87
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,570
before opening a tea shop?

88
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,820
It's so simple.

89
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,810
My fault.

90
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,920
What is a tea permit?

91
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,050
Is it important?

92
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,810
Are you serious?

93
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,040
Selling tea without a permit

94
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,650
means you are dealing in illicit tea.

95
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,670
In serious cases,
it means the death penalty.

96
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,240
Death penalty?

97
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,850
Death penalty...

98
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,520
Do you not know this?

99
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,790
Tea merchants who trade tea

100
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,730
must have a tea permit

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,250
issued by the government.

102
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,410
Why is that?

103
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,150
Tea concerns the state's foundation,

104
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,010
like salt and iron.

105
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,920
It's not something
anyone can sell at will.

106
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,030
I understand salt and iron,

107
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,250
but why tea?

108
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,770
You don't get it, do you?

109
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,570
Our state governs
the border through tea.

110
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,670
Those people over there
eat meat and drink dairy.

111
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,340
A day without tea causes stagnation.

112
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,250
Three days without tea causes illness.

113
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,330
Tea is a necessity for them.

114
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,400
So, we use tea

115
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,130
to trade for their horses.

116
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,290
Horses?

117
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,920
Think about it. The main force

118
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,890
on the battlefield is cavalry.

119
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,910
Without good horses,

120
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,330
how can you beat them?

121
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,990
So, the court always

122
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,450
exchanges tea for horses
and forbids private tea.

123
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,650
If private tea ran rampant,

124
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,920
they could simply buy it

125
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,990
from you

126
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,040
instead of trading horses.

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,820
You would ruin the state's plan.

128
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,500
It's serious.

129
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,020
Then, let's just get

130
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,860
a tea permit now.

131
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,940
Is that okay?

132
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,380
That's easier said than done.

133
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,740
Even if you get one now,

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,700
it's too late.

135
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,980
I think those two

136
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,380
will likely be exiled to Shamen Island.

137
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,940
What?

138
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,900
Going to that place

139
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
is worse than dying.

140
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,420
Is there no way out?

141
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,980
Ways depend

142
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,940
on our minds.

143
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,460
Here.

144
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,260
Officials

145
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,820
only investigate reports.

146
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,820
Someone set you up.

147
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,420
You mean someone purposely reported us?

148
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,580
That's your claim, not mine.

149
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,140
Let's work.

150
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,300
I know who did it.

151
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,500
Madam, you're so good.

152
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,300
With a simple move,

153
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,860
you just sent

154
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,940
Jing Kan

155
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,300
to jail.

156
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Don't think

157
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,460
I'm nice

158
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,540
just because I keep quiet.

159
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,500
I'll use this to show him

160
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,300
what I'm capable of.

161
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,940
You're right.

162
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,300
Now, the Old Lady isn't home.

163
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,820
Everything's in our control.

164
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,180
No one would dare to protect him.

165
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,500
Be careful about your words.

166
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,620
Eat more if you like,

167
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,140
but don't speak carelessly.

168
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,180
If you speak wrongly outside,

169
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,920
who'll suffer the consequences?

170
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,260
Yes.

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,460
Yes.

172
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Jing Kan was arrested?

173
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,380
Ms. Luo went too far.

174
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,700
So wicked.

175
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,380
We're all family.

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,620
A quarrel at home is enough,

177
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,340
but she had him thrown into prison.

178
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,500
Isn't that wicked?

179
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,820
Mother,

180
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,860
we have no proof now.

181
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,540
How can you be sure it's Auntie?

182
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,860
What do you mean?

183
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,140
Are you saying I did it?

184
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,540
What proof do we need?

185
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,260
Justice lies in people's hearts.

186
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,220
You know nothing.

187
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,100
Auntie,

188
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,540
sorry

189
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,900
about what we've done before,

190
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,300
but this time,

191
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,420
we really need your help.

192
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,740
Of course.

193
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,700
Jing Kan is

194
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,740
like my own son.

195
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,020
Of course, I'll help.

196
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,980
If we help him,

197
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,020
what's in it for us?

198
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,340
Go away.

199
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,620
We're family.
What benefit do you expect?

200
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Sixi.

201
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,460
Well.

202
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,420
If you ask me

203
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,260
to sew a quilt or make some clothes

204
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,580
for Jing Kan,

205
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,260
I can surely do that.

206
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,580
But if it involves the government,

207
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,960
I really have no connections.

208
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Auntie,

209
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,860
as long as you

210
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,020
can save Jing Kan this time,

211
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,800
I'll agree to any condition you ask.

212
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,300
You said it.

213
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,060
If I can rescue him,

214
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,460
you'll give me your shop.

215
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,420
Fine.

216
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,580
What plan do you have?

217
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,500
My uncle...

218
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,580
Just shut up.

219
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,540
Such nonsense.

220
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,060
My uncle can save Jing Kan.

221
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,300
He can't.

222
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,660
Her uncle used to work
for the Patrol Division,

223
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,300
but now he's been dismissed.

224
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,820
Zhenzhu doesn't know this.

225
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,220
If there's anything I can do,

226
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,460
I'll surely help you.

227
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,340
What to do then?

228
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
What to do?

229
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,980
Have you told your Mother about this?

230
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Not yet.

231
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,540
Go tell her then.

232
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,740
Let me tell you.

233
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,680
Only the person who tied the knot
can untie it.

234
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,700
Yes, I understand that.

235
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,940
I'm just afraid
she won't spare Jing Kan.

236
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,140
Why don't I go to Auntie first?

237
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,980
Go away.

238
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,340
Go take some

239
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,220
lily and lotus seed congee,

240
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,820
so Sixi can relax.

241
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,900
No need.

242
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,740
I won't drink the congee.

243
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm leaving.

244
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,540
You're not going to drink?

245
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,980
Take care of your health.

246
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,420
Don't get worked up.

247
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Mother,

248
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,340
are we really going to do nothing?

249
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,660
Do what?

250
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,940
You two

251
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,420
act like fools.

252
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,740
Given the current situation,

253
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,220
Luo Zhusi is clearly set

254
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,100
on punishing Jing Kan.

255
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,940
If you ask me,

256
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,220
Jing Kan needs to take a fall.

257
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Do you think

258
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,580
he respects me in daily life?

259
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,540
Now, he lets his wife come
and plead with me.

260
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,060
Am I someone merciful?

261
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,660
Hasn't your age

262
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,580
taught you anything, Mother?

263
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,060
Do you think your face

264
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,340
will buy you anything?

265
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,260
What good is that for?

266
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,900
If you don't take over the shop now,

267
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
what if Luo Zhusi takes it away?

268
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,780
Here comes the shop again.

269
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,860
Can you really manage it?

270
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,160
That shop is a trap,

271
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,580
and you want to jump right into it.

272
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,460
I've eaten more salt

273
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,860
than the rice in your life.

274
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,340
Just cut down on the salt.

275
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,580
Aren't you troubled by it?

276
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,460
Let me tell you both.

277
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,940
Do not meddle in this matter now.

278
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,340
Whoever goes will be troubled.

279
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,020
From my years

280
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,580
in this family,

281
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,180
we should wait
until Luo Zhusi cools off,

282
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,220
then go with the flow

283
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,340
and find a way to rescue Jing Kan.

284
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,860
At the same time,

285
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,740
we can take over that shop.

286
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,900
Mother, you're so clever.

287
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,300
You're such a craftswoman,

288
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,980
good at weaving bamboo baskets

289
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,220
for drawing water.

290
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,980
You'll surely end up with nothing.

291
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,340
Why must you mock me?

292
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,660
So annoying.

293
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,500
Who is it?

294
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,220
Who...

295
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Who?

296
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Who is it?

297
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh, it's you.

298
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,020
What are you doing so late?

299
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,500
You didn't even knock.

300
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,500
That's so rude.

301
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,700
What's the matter?

302
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
You...

303
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,220
What are you doing?

304
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,980
You...

305
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,460
Cuiying, Cuiying.

306
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,740
You...

307
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,780
What do you want?

308
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,620
Madam, I'm here.

309
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,100
Mother.

310
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,500
Please, save Jing Kan.

311
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,980
How can I save him?

312
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Mother,

313
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,020
Jing Kan carries

314
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,620
Father's blood.

315
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,620
Even if you don't consider him,

316
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,740
consider his father.

317
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,780
Half of his blood belongs to the master.

318
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,020
What about the other half?

319
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
The other half...

320
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
The other half

321
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,460
belongs to tea.

322
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Mother...

323
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,060
I've never regarded you

324
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,140
as my daughter-in-law.

325
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,220
That's fine.

326
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,380
If you can save Jing Kan,

327
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,700
do whatever you want.

328
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
I beg you.

329
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,980
Begging won't work.

330
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,140
I've heard of this.

331
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,980
The tea permit is so important.

332
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,580
Jing Kan

333
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,140
was too careless.

334
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,660
So, you set him off?

335
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,180
I...

336
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,860
Who said so?

337
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,580
Do you have any proof?

338
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,900
Yes, Cuiying is right.

339
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,780
How could Mother treat her own son

340
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,180
with such cruelty,

341
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,060
spite, and malice

342
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,380
by having him imprisoned?

343
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,620
The mastermind

344
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,620
will surely be punished.

345
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,580
Stop, stop.

346
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,580
Why curse others like that?

347
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
What I mean is...

348
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,220
Mother,

349
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,620
please help Jing Kan this time.

350
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
He knows he's wrong.

351
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,260
I'd like to help him,

352
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,620
but think about it.

353
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,340
If I save him,

354
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,700
when will he

355
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,980
ever grow?

356
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,140
But if you don't help him,

357
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,260
he won't live to grow.

358
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,580
That would be his fate.

359
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,620
So, you decide

360
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,780
to watch him die?

361
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,380
You can't kneel anymore?

362
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,340
If you're willing to help Jing Kan,

363
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,240
I'll kneel here as long as it takes.

364
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,360
But Grandmother is not at home now.

365
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,580
If someone takes advantage of this

366
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,340
to plot against Jing Kan,

367
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,460
I won't agree to it.

368
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,140
Who are you threatening?

369
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,860
You're a married couple.

370
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,500
You should act like this.

371
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,140
I will not give up on Jing Kan.

372
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,220
Listen...

373
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,900
Who'd be so wicked to set such a trap?

374
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,500
(Jing Residence)

375
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Milady.

376
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I heard from Mingyue

377
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,220
that Ms. Luo just wants to punish him

378
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,340
as a warning.

379
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,860
She feared the Old Lady

380
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,500
would not let it go.

381
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,220
Are you sure?

382
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,380
Absolutely.

383
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,820
She heard it when she went

384
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,740
to deliver tea.

385
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,740
Did she

386
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,740
tell anyone else about this?

387
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,780
Probably not.

388
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,860
We talked about it

389
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,780
while washing clothes.

390
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
That's good.

391
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,020
Tell her

392
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,100
not to tell others.

393
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,460
She works for Ms. Luo.

394
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,380
How can I stop her

395
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,940
from telling others?

396
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,980
Aren't you friends?

397
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,140
She won't even agree to that?

398
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,540
What kind of friendship is this?

399
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,860
So, how can we

400
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,420
keep her quiet?

401
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
My goodness.

402
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,780
So desperate for money.

403
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
All of you are like this.

404
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,500
Give it to her.

405
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,460
Thanks, milady.

406
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,660
Why stand there? Go.

407
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,180
Milady.

408
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,340
Isn't there one more?

409
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,100
So desperate for money. Go.

410
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,060
Thanks, milady.

411
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,180
I don't have

412
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,460
much left.

413
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
What?

414
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
What do you mean?

415
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,940
What do you want?

416
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
Milady,

417
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,180
we won't tell anyone.

418
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,340
So many thieves at home.

419
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Sixi,

420
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
this is all the money we have now.

421
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,660
Is it enough to bribe Magistrate Meng?

422
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,820
It'd be okay if he were three.

423
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,940
This won't even stuff

424
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,460
that official's mouth.

425
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,100
Guiwei,

426
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
take this letter

427
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,420
to Songxi County and find Yu.

428
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,660
He knows many people.

429
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,620
Let him think of a way.

430
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Come on.

431
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,940
You're also hanging by a thread.

432
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,260
Take care of yourself first.

433
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,940
I'm fine, at least for now.

434
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Just listen to me.

435
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,100
Shall we break into the prison?

436
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,460
Great.

437
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,820
We'll all die together.

438
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,940
How lively.

439
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Zhu.

440
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,780
- Zhenzhu.
- Zhen.

441
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,060
- Zhenzhu.
- Zhenzhu.

442
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,940
Show me some respect.

443
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,700
Zhenzhu, we're very worried.

444
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,940
Don't interrupt, okay?

445
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
You

446
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,580
are lucky

447
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,620
to have met me.

448
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,300
How so?

449
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,780
Honestly,

450
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,220
although I usually

451
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,900
don't get along with Jing Kan,

452
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,820
we grew up

453
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,020
together after all.

454
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,780
Seeing him like this

455
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,180
makes me sad.

456
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,660
Has your uncle been reinstated?

457
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,980
Don't worry about that.

458
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,700
Listen, I'll help you.

459
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,060
Really?

460
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,860
You don't trust me? Bye.

461
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
Zhenzhu.

462
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
I mean what I said.

463
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,300
If you can get Jing Kan out,

464
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,780
I'll give you the shop.

465
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
Good.

466
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,300
With that temper of yours,

467
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,740
we're surely bound as sisters.

468
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,420
So, how do you plan to save him?

469
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,700
I have connections in the yamen.

470
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,460
Who, your uncle?

471
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
No.

472
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,900
Everyone has

473
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,820
their own methods.

474
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,380
In short, I've pulled some strings,

475
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,380
so just

476
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
rest assured.

477
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,500
Bye.

478
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I'll see you off.

479
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,580
No need.

480
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
I'm here.

481
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,220
Thanks, Zhu.

482
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
Move aside.

483
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,060
(Intoxicating Spring)

484
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,380
(Taiping Government)

485
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,460
Milord, milord.

486
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,940
Don't sleep yet.

487
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,500
Milord,

488
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,140
the Jings sent someone

489
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,180
with 100 jin of rice,

490
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,740
saying they hope

491
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,700
you can look after Jing Kan.

492
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,420
Do they think 100 taels

493
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,100
will get them my help?

494
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,660
Am I that cheap?

495
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Milord, milord.

496
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,100
It's as easy as pie for you.

497
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,860
Alright, behead him.

498
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,020
Milord, milord.

499
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,140
What are you doing?

500
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,420
You can't behead him.

501
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,740
They want you

502
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,860
to have mercy on him.

503
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,940
You got it wrong.

504
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,660
You should be clearer.

505
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,700
Then release him.

506
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Milord, milord.

507
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,900
The Jings don't want you

508
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,380
to release him so easily.

509
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,340
They want you

510
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,940
to punish him first.

511
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,500
Then release him after beheading him.

512
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,100
No, milord.

513
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,220
What exactly do they want?

514
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,620
Please calm down, milord.

515
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,500
Do I have to guess

516
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,660
what favor they want?

517
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,700
Am I the magistrate

518
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,180
to serve them?

519
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,700
Milord.

520
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,540
Alright.

521
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,540
Behead him.

522
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,860
I'll see if Jing Kan can withstand it.

523
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,820
We've taken the money.

524
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,020
Say another word

525
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,500
and we'll behead you, too.

526
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,100
Get out.

527
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,060
Yes.

528
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,500
(Heavenly Feathers)

529
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Milady.

530
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,380
- Drink.
- Careful.

531
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,540
I'll drink.

532
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,020
I'll surely outdrink them.

533
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,220
Watch the step.

534
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,740
So drunk again.

535
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,100
Be careful.

536
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,540
Slow down.

537
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Quick, there, there.

538
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,880
I'll surely outdrink you.

539
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
Drink.

540
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,100
Milady.

541
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,220
Why are you so drunk?

542
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,320
I'll surely outdrink them.

543
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,220
I'll fetch you a soup to sober up.

544
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
No need.

545
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,940
Do I look drunk?

546
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,340
I suppose...

547
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,780
so.

548
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,700
This little wine

549
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,180
won't faze me.

550
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,540
Milady,

551
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
who did you drink

552
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,700
so much with?

553
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,260
Those women at the Tea Guild

554
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,380
looked down on me.

555
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,660
One said

556
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,500
her husband

557
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,660
was so powerful.

558
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,060
Another said

559
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,140
her mother was so powerful.

560
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,420
As if they themselves were so powerful.

561
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,800
They just shamed me like that.

562
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,140
Listen.

563
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,540
I've spread the word.

564
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,100
The Anping Bridge Shop

565
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,740
will reopen in ten days.

566
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,820
Milady,

567
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,780
why take them

568
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,900
seriously?

569
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,860
Go.

570
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,780
Go fetch Ai Sixi.

571
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,900
You want to drink more?

572
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,940
I must let her see it.

573
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,580
I want her to see

574
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,700
how I've racked my brains

575
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,260
and risked my life,

576
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,500
working day and night,

577
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,700
to save her husband.

578
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,940
If she's moved,

579
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,300
she'd give me the shop at once.

580
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,380
Milady,

581
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,780
you drank so much

582
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,740
for Ai Sixi?

583
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
My goodness.

584
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,380
You're such a fool.

585
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,540
Never mind.

586
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,540
Just go fetch her.

587
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,160
- Okay.
- Hurry.

588
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,140
Not comfortable enough.

589
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
So good.

590
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,780
Ai Sixi.

591
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,940
Ai Sixi...

592
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,740
Why isn't she here yet?

593
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,980
- Milady, she's here.
- Ai Sixi.

594
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,100
Zhu,

595
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,780
how much did you drink?

596
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,700
I drank for my good cousin,

597
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
- Jing Kan.
- I'll get you some water.

598
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,580
I'll get you some water.

599
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,700
I'll drink as much

600
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,100
as I need.

601
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
Drink some water.

602
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,860
I don't want it.

603
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,620
- Come on.
- Careful.

604
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,740
Ai Sixi...

605
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,620
Ai...

606
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Drink some water.

607
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,940
Why did you come alone?

608
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,220
My cousin is drunk, too.

609
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,860
She's going wild in her room.

610
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,540
Milady, milady.

611
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,900
Jing Kan,

612
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,780
I'll definitely save you.

613
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,860
But how can I save you?

614
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,940
I don't know what to do.

615
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,700
I wrote to Grandmother,

616
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,940
but I don't know when she'll be back.

617
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,620
Ai Sixi.

618
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,180
Ai Sixi.

619
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Ai...

620
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
All for nothing.

621
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,940
Ai Sixi.

622
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,540
Zhenzhu, you're here.

623
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,780
Sixi.

624
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,940
Sixi,

625
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,420
you don't know

626
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,460
how much I suffered today.

627
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,860
In all my life,

628
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,900
I've never drunk so much wine.

629
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,100
What happened in the end?

630
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,980
There's hope.

631
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,300
But they said

632
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,860
you can't be trusted.

633
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,860
Give me that shop now,

634
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,740
or all my efforts will be in vain.

635
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,980
Got it.

636
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,420
I've long prepared

637
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,900
the transfer deed.

638
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,940
You'll surely be my friend.

639
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,020
It's not about trust.

640
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,380
As soon as Jing Kan is released,

641
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,220
the deed will be yours.

642
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,660
So, you...

643
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,940
You'll give it to me anyway.

644
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,660
Fine, it's a deal.

645
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,220
(Spring Breeze)

646
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,300
Milady, you needed me?

647
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,220
Did Mingyue tell you

648
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,700
how long Auntie's little punishment

649
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,940
is to last?

650
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,500
Well.

651
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,460
Listen.

652
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,180
I already told

653
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,100
those Tea Guild women

654
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,140
that my shop will reopen

655
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,100
in nine days.

656
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,220
If this can't be done,

657
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,620
I'll be embarrassed.

658
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,300
But milady,

659
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,660
Mingyue really didn't say.

660
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,500
It's okay.

661
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,380
Then,

662
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,660
tell Mingyue to persuade Auntie

663
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,580
and let her hurry up.

664
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,900
Milady, how can she do that?

665
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,740
One for you.

666
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,860
One for Mingyue.

667
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,100
Money makes the millstones talk.

668
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,100
Go.

669
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,460
- Milady.
- Zhenzhu.

670
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,380
Go, hurry.

671
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,540
I was drunk last night.

672
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,140
You went to ask for help, right?

673
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,100
Sit, Sixi.

674
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,860
Don't worry. Everything's done.

675
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
There's hope?

676
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,700
There's more than hope.

677
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,100
He will be released at once.

678
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,220
That's wonderful.

679
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,220
Just sit there.

680
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,260
No. 357.

681
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,500
- No. 357.
- What again?

682
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,620
Jing Kan...

683
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,020
What did I tell you?

684
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,220
Good news.

685
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,900
Has Jing Kan been released?

686
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,340
He's been sentenced to death.

687
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,140
What?

688
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,700
They even posted a notice.

689
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Jing Zhenzhu,

690
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,560
didn't you say you pulled some strings?

691
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,090
You only made things worse!

692
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,060
I didn't.

693
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Who exactly did you find?

694
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,060
I...

695
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,060
Well.

696
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,380
I'll just give up

697
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,460
that shop for now.

698
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,660
Come back.

699
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,940
What exactly happened?

700
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,620
Tell me.

701
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,540
I didn't find anyone.

702
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,380
You didn't?

703
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,640
I thought it was almost done,

704
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,580
so I just took advantage

705
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,620
to take some credit.

706
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,140
You said Auntie

707
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,100
just wanted

708
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,220
to punish him, right?

709
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,140
Yes, yes.

710
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Mingyue really said so.

711
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,460
I didn't do anything.

712
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,980
The notice is posted already?

713
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,700
Isn't that punishment enough?

714
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,500
What more do you want?

715
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,380
All the Jings are bad people!

716
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,380
(Jinyu Tea)

717
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,780
Lately, our tea plantation

718
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,260
has produced a total of 1,280 jin.

719
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,140
The best-selling branch

720
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,420
is still our main store.

721
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,980
The Wushen Temple Shop

722
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,460
comes second in sales,

723
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,300
followed by the Shijing Spring Shop.

724
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,300
Madam, Madam.

725
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,700
Madam, it's bad.

726
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,220
What are you so flustered?

727
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,420
I told you

728
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,740
to always remain composed.

729
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,100
Jing Kan has been sentenced to death.

730
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
What?

731
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,220
Stop what you're doing.

732
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Rest for a moment.

733
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,780
Yes.

734
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,860
What happened?

735
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,300
What should we do, Madam?

736
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,860
The Old Lady has returned.

737
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,020
So suddenly? Why?

738
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
I don't know.

739
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,740
Did you deliver 100 taels of silver

740
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,700
to Magistrate Meng

741
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,860
as I asked?

742
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,820
Yes.

743
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,580
100 taels of high-quality silver.

744
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,540
Then,

745
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,020
did you say anything you shouldn't?

746
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,220
No.

747
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,900
I asked them

748
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,460
to look after Jing Kan.

749
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,940
Look after him...

750
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,380
It sounds fine.

751
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,340
Yes.

752
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,420
What expression did you have?

753
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,060
- Expression?
- Yes, expression.

754
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,780
Advisor Xia,

755
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,860
please tell Magistrate Meng

756
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,780
to look after Jing Kan.

757
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,660
Your expression was wrong.

758
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,700
Wrong expression?

759
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,220
It looked sinister.

760
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,460
Impossible.

761
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,060
I'm not sinister.

762
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,220
I just look like this.

763
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,380
Isn't that sinister?

764
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,900
Could it be he thought

765
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,220
we gave too little money?

766
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,900
Too little?

767
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,900
He still

768
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,860
shouldn't have had murderous intent.

769
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,940
Those officials are unpredictable.

770
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
I told you

771
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,180
to listen to me

772
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,460
and not to provoke them.

773
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,860
What's the use of saying this now?

774
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,700
What should we do now?

775
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,020
Give them another 200 taels of silver

776
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,980
and tell Magistrate Meng

777
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,740
to spare him.

778
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Yes.

779
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,260
Wait.

780
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,220
We must make sure no one knows

781
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,500
that we're helping Jing Kan,

782
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,940
or what would people think?

783
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,780
Yes, yes.

784
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,780
Understood.

785
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,620
Be careful about how you do it.

786
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,140
Alright.

787
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Calm down.

788
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,500
Tell me about your grievances.

789
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,620
Wasn't Jing Kan supposed to be exiled?

790
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,140
Why was he suddenly sentenced to death?

791
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,940
That was decided by higher-ups.

792
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,860
How would I know?

793
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,220
I'm going to find Magistrate Meng.

794
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Wait.

795
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,140
Let go.

796
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,740
We're acquaintances.

797
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,700
Don't cause trouble.

798
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,860
Let me tell you the truth.

799
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,100
Someone in your family

800
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,740
slipped money to the higher-ups

801
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,180
to handle it specially.

802
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,900
Was it Jing Zhenzhu?

803
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,260
I don't know who it was.

804
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,340
Anyway, it was someone in your family.

805
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,660
Fine, if Jing Kan dies,

806
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,460
no one else will live.

807
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,060
My Lady,

808
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,220
the letter is ready.

809
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,900
Take it to Lord Xu
in Anning Prefecture now

810
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,900
and tell him

811
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,620
I'll agree to any condition

812
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,540
if he can save my grandson.

813
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
Yes.

814
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,460
I just left,

815
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,900
and you're already plotting
against Jing Kan.

816
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,100
Who did it?

817
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Grandmother,

818
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,940
it has nothing to do with me.

819
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,300
Tell me. Was it her?

820
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,740
We don't know.

821
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,780
Tell me. Was it her?

822
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,060
Mother,

823
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,540
this can't have anything

824
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,020
to do with Zhenzhu.

825
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,980
Sit down.

826
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,940
I'll settle accounts with you later.

827
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,780
Stop stalling.

828
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,620
Tell us everything you know.

829
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
Tell me.

830
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,220
Old Lady, please spare us.

831
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,620
Zhenzhu told us not to speak.

832
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,220
She gave us some money

833
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,500
to keep us quiet.

834
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,060
Zhenzhu,

835
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,980
what exactly did you do?

836
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,620
How dare you ask me?

837
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,180
This all started because of you.

838
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,740
- Mingzhen.
- Yes.

839
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,860
Starting with Jing Zhenzhu,

840
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,660
hit them one by one

841
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
until they tell the truth.

842
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,060
Grandmother.

843
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,140
Go away.

844
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,990
Stop, Sixi.

845
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,460
You bunch of jerks.

846
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,780
I'll fight you all.

847
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,740
What are you doing?

848
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,100
Ai Sixi has gone mad.

849
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,500
Why can't you accommodate Jing Kan?

850
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,900
Why must you kill him?

851
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,540
Sixi, calm down.

852
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,660
Sixi,

853
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
as long as I'm here,

854
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,140
Jing Kan won't die.

855
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,540
Yes.

856
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,700
Trust me.

857
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,940
Yes, yes.

858
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,300
Yes.

859
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,940
Yes, yes.

860
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,420
Trust my niece.

861
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,540
Put it down. Take it away.

862
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,940
Come, come here.

863
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,380
Come to me.

864
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,780
(Refined Chamber)

865
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Milord.

866
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,140
Slow down, slow down.

867
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,700
Milord.

868
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,140
The Jings sent a messenger.

869
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,100
They want to plead for Jing Kan.

870
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,100
Plead for what?

871
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,220
Jing Kan's death sentence.

872
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,340
His crime

873
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,860
doesn't deserve death.

874
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,420
Right, it doesn't, milord.

875
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,380
Then, which brat

876
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,420
sentenced him?

877
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,780
You.

878
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,580
(Taiping Government)

879
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,540
Luckily, you came to me.

880
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,260
If it were someone else,

881
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,780
who could handle this?

882
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,180
Yes, yes.

883
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,740
Advisor Xia,

884
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,900
please think of a way

885
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,700
to save Jing Kan's life.

886
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,380
It's difficult.

887
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,500
You know

888
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,100
how Magistrate Meng is.

889
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,900
Once he makes a decision...

890
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,500
Jing Kan's chances are slim.

891
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,780
I haven't finished it.

892
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,820
I'm saying

893
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,420
that it's hard to change

894
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,740
the Magistrate's mind,

895
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,660
but

896
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,700
it depends on what one can do.

897
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,820
In all of Taiping County,

898
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,500
only you can do this.

899
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,460
Given our relationship,

900
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,700
I'll think of a way.

901
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,740
Advisor Xia,

902
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,580
hearing you say this,

903
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,100
I feel reassured.

904
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,660
We'll cover

905
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,180
(Taiping Government)
your bill

906
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,840
at Zuixian Restaurant before.

907
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,260
No problem, no problem.

908
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,620
But I have to warn you.

909
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,980
Jing Kan can live,

910
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,060
but he'll surely be punished.

911
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,500
No matter what,

912
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,260
he has to work
at the Tribute Tea Plantation

913
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,580
for some days.

914
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,780
This is already the best result.

915
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,860
Thanks, Advisor Xia.

916
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,140
I've sent someone

917
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,100
to deliver our thanks to your mansion.

918
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
No problem.

919
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,860
Then I'll leave it to you.

920
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,540
Sure. You can go back now.

921
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Alright.

922
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Rest assured.

923
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
Good.

924
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:46,980
(Taiping Government)

925
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:57,460
(Jail)

926
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,500
Jing Kan.

927
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,700
Sixi, you're here.

928
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,060
Are you alright?

929
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,140
I'm fine.

930
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Thanks to you.

931
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,260
Or I wouldn't be alive.

932
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,980
Actually, I didn't do much.

933
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,220
You definitely did a lot.

934
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,220
I know.

935
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,820
Alright.

936
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,300
Anyway, you're fine now.

937
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,260
Glad that you're fine.

938
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,060
Is it over already?

939
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,540
Isn't anyone concerned about me?

940
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,980
Do I really have to go?

941
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,100
What about him?

942
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,700
Just him.

943
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Why isn't he going?

944
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,780
Ai Sixi asked

945
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,860
about it for you.

946
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
The officials said

947
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,860
the reporting customers

948
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,380
claimed you sold them the tea.

949
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,300
- So, you have to go.
- Yes.

950
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,340
Who are you?

951
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,900
A reasonable person.

952
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,100
Who is she?

953
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,220
She's my great-grandaunt.

954
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,420
Great-grandaunt?

955
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,980
You don't need to worry.

956
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,580
You're just to going work
at the Tribute Tea Plantation.

957
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,620
Consider it an exercise.

958
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,420
What do you know?

959
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,740
Great-grandaunt, why are you here?

960
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,380
Your grandmother, my niece,

961
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,980
sent me to give you some advice.

962
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,580
She said you must take this punishment

963
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,700
as a kind of experience.

964
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,340
Remember not to show off,

965
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,700
and protect yourself well.

966
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Also,

967
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,660
here's some advice from me.

968
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,340
I think you should be careful
of the people around you.

969
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,820
They don't look righteous.

970
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,260
Could you speak a bit louder?

971
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
Who's not righteous?

972
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,340
I'm completely innocent.

973
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,780
How should I put it?
They look hypocritical

974
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,500
and always glance at people sideways.

975
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,580
Of course.

976
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,060
Can I glance straight at you now?

977
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Shouldn't they leave now?

978
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,100
- Let's go.
- Move, move.

979
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,180
(Jail)
Jing Kan.

980
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,260
- Kan.
- Be careful there.

981
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,380
Alright.

982
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,180
Eat well.

983
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,100
- Improve yourself.
- You want to be arrested?

984
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,140
Got it.

985
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,140
Don't fight anyone.

986
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,860
Alright. I'm leaving, too.

987
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,940
I'll buy some Wufang beans
to eat with drinks.

988
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,380
Bye, No. 357.

989
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,420
Go, No. 132.

990
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,140
See?

991
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,540
I knew you were in love.

992
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Listen.

993
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,740
Now that they're both inside,

994
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,780
only you're in the shop.

995
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,700
Be alert.

996
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
Don't worry.

997
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,620
I'll memorize the price

998
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,540
of each tea again.

999
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,470
You haven't memorized it yet?

1000
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,540
I was memorizing

1001
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,700
a tea poem.

1002
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
What tea poem?

1003
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
"The Seven Bowls of Tea"

1004
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,400
from the portrait of Lu Tong

1005
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,060
in our shop.

1006
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,660
Why memorize that?

1007
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,420
To show people I'm educated.

1008
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Listen, I'll recite it.

1009
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,700
The first bowl moistens the throat.

1010
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,080
Do you know what's next?

1011
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,440
The second bowl dispels loneliness.

1012
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,460
The third bowl...

1013
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,580
Then what was it again?

1014
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,640
I'll memorize it again.
