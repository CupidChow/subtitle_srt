Hearing about a nice tea tree,

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
she headed for it.

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,680
Oh no. This is bad.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,960
This is really bad.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
What is bad?

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Things seem to be going

Dangerous?

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
Ai Sixi is in danger?

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,560
Not her.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,640
Me, instead.

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,560

Xue Muyun?

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
She...

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,600
The way she looks at me...

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
It's a bit like...

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,240
It's something like

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,120
how a woman looks at her man.

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
You often say she treats you
like her confidant.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Dude,

48
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,870
I think now she treats me
like her sweetheart.

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Kan,

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
I swear upon our friendship,

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm not making it up.

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,920
You have to believe me.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
I believe you.

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,040
So, what do you want to do?

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
I want

56
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
to terminate my plan early.

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,280
Go ahead, then.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,360
You approved?

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
Why would I not?

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,680
It's you who proposed this plan.

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,120
However,

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
I've left something

64
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
in her shop.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,160
Do you want us to fetch it?

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Never mind.

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
I don't want it.

68
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,120
What on earth is so serious?

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
The fresh tea leaves look good.

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Guess what? Throughout the plantation,

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,480
fifteen tea farmers picked all morning

72
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
and got this much.

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
This is all we have.

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,360
I hurried back with it.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,240
You had a long trip.

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
It's nothing.

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Will you start now?

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
They're too damp.

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
They must be dried.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
How long will they be aired?

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,800
It's wet today.

82
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,720
A long while, I think.

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,440
By noon tomorrow.

84
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,240
These fresh tea leaves are nice.

85
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,980
(Jinyu Tea Plantation)

86
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,720
Where are you going so late?

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,120
I've made up my mind.

88
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,960
I can discard anything else.

89
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
But I must get back the cup

90
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,600
Shuangxi gave me.

91
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
So,

92
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm going

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,800
to Xue Muyun's shop.

94
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,040
Are you all right?

95
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
Yes.

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
He tried to be cool.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,680
How can I get in there?

98
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Mr. Ruan.

99
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Don't.

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
What do you want?

101
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
No, no, no.

102
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,010
Don't. Please don't.

103
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
Hey...

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,440
Why did you tie me up?

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,080
You terrible guys!

106
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,620
When will you stop avoiding me?

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,080
I didn't invite you over

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
for anything serious.

109
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,760
I just want to talk to you.

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Talk to me?

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
Let's make a deal.

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,520
All you can do is talk.

113
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
I saved some money

114
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,080
to have bought this house.

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Besides,

116
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I have a house in Anning Prefecture,

117
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,840
two tea plantations on Bailong Mountain,

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,680
and a few fields in Long'an County.

119
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,520
But I didn't know until today

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
these possessions could no longer

121
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,000
make me happy.

122
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,320
But... I can't, either.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
You know what, Ruan Ling?

124
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,600
You look just like my senior brother.

125
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,600
Back then,

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,760
we sang operas in an opera troupe.

127
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,480
He was a comedian.

128
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
I was a female role.

129
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
Later,

130
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
my father married me to Jing Nanfeng.

131
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
At that time,

132
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
he asked me

133
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,960
if I would leave with him.

134
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
I didn't agree.

135
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,720
I haven't seen him ever since.

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,320
I often woke up from a dream

137
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
and looked at the high walls around me.

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,520
I was thinking,

139
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,720
"Would I live like this

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,520
all my life?"

141
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Ruan Ling,

142
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,760
has this story

143
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
scared you?

144
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
No.

145
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,000
I thought

146
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,520
when I embezzled a bit more money,

147
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,520
I could make it up for myself.

148
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
But later, I realized.

149
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,920
I was just deceiving myself.

150
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
Ruan Ling,

151
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,120
can you not tell anyone else

152
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,680
what I'm telling you now?

153
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,910
You have my word.

154
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,240
I won't tell anyone.

155
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
What do you want?

156
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,760
I'll give it to you

157
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,880
as a present for leaving this shop.

158
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,160
Leave this shop?

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,440
Can I?

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,400
Actually, I don't want anything.

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
I just hope

162
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,880
you will forget me.

163
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't hate me, I mean.

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,400
You may leave.

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,400
I'll pretend these days,

166
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,280
I was being younger

167
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,960
and did something
I didn't dare at that time.

168
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Ruan Ling.

169
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Thank you.

170
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
You're welcome.

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
I should go, then.

172
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,800
I...

173
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,720
Is it...?

174
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll take my leave.

175
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,600
You... You take care.

176
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,880
How could they leave

177
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
such an important thing here?

178
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,440
Oh no.

Reddish. They're reddish.

182
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,760
What do I do?

183
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,120
I...

184
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,320
What can I do?

this year's contest.

Umm...

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,960
I pan-fired them.

193
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,080
What did you say?

194
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,720
The tea leaves.

195
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,760
I pan-fired them.

196
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,760
Who told you to do that?

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,560
Isn't it better than being dumped

198
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,320
after they were pressed under the quilt

199
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,240
and slept on all night?

200
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,480
What are you talking about?

201
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,360
Can you not hit me if I'm honest?

202
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,600
That depends

203
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,160
on how honest you are.

204
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,440
- Speak!
- Fine. Calm down.

205
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,930
Here's the thing. Last night,

206
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,320
I thought someone might break in

207
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
and it was not safe here.

208
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,640
So, I moved them to my bed.

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,440
I thought it would be safe.

210
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,200
But this morning, when I woke up,

211
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
I was sleeping on them.

212
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,290
The fresh tea leaves

213
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,240
turned a bit reddish.

214
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,240
If I dumped them,

215
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,280
it would be a waste.

216
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,160
So, I pan-fired them.

217
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,040
After that, I...

218
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,520
This is it, and I think

219
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,720
it doesn't taste too bad.

220
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,600
Well, Sixi and Kan,

221
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
would you like some?

222
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,160
- Come.
- Sixi, it tastes good.

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,720
- Try some.
- Come.

224
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
- Taste it.
- I'll kill you.

225
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,800
Sixi.

226
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
Ruan Ling isn't back yet?

227
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Where's Sixi?

228
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,870
What's this? So bitter.

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,640
It smells good, though.

230
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,080
Even the butterfly likes

231
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,440
something so bitter?

232
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
Si... Sixi.

233
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,480
I was hitting him.

234
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
Look.

235
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,640
What's wrong?

236
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,000
Guiwei.

237
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,920
Guiwei!

238
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,200
The leaves were overcooked.

239
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
The tea has a smell of smoke.

240
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,640
However,

241
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,960
this kind of smell

242
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,640
is unique.

243
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,400
It smells good, huh?

244
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,440
Any fresh tea leaves?

245
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,040
Kan,

246
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,120
this is all we have.

247
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,960
I'll try.

248
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,360
Those fresh leaves are so important.

249
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,720
How could you even sleep on them?

250
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,840
I know.

251
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,040
I didn't mean to hurt them.

252
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't talk back.

253
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Try doing that again.

254
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,160
Sixi, stop it. It hurts.

255
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm going to kill you.

256
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,360
Stop hitting me, Sixi.

257
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,000
- Sixi.
- Stop running.

258
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
I was wrong.

259
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
- You...
- It hurts.

260
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
- Talk back, huh?
- Sorry.

261
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,200
- Have you learned your lesson?
- Yes, yes.

262
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,780
Is it done?

263
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,400
Yes, yes. Look.

264
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,160
Why does the tea look so dark?

265
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,080
You'll know.

266
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,120
Come on. Taste it.

267
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,080
All right.

268
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,480
Don't just grunt. Say something.

269
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,560
Make a comment.

270
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
This tea

271
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
is unlike anything I've tried.

272
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,680
Unlike anything?

273
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
It has

274
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,800
a very new taste.

275
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,010
So...

276
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,280
Does it taste good?

277
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,440
Yes, it does.

278
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,320
Really?

279
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
When I drank tea,

280
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,080
I would feel bad

281
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
in my stomach.

282
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,400
But this tea makes me warm all over.

283
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,360
Actually, you don't need

284
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,040
to analyze the taste of good tea.

285
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,440
Your body will naturally respond.

286
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
This is the sense of tea.

287
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,440
The closer one is linked to tea,

288
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,640
the stronger he feels.

289
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
That's true.

290
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
After having a few cups,

291
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,920
I feel so hot now.

292
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,880
My back is sweating.

293
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm refreshed.

294
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,880
You don't need to flatter me

295
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
just to encourage me.

296
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,240
Not at all. I'm serious.

297
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm not kidding.

298
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,640
Fine.

299
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,760
Now, I know what to do.

300
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,800
So, how are you going to name this tea?

301
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,120
When I was pan-firing this tea,

302
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,360
I suddenly thought of my mother's poem.

303
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,720
Poem? What poem?

304
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
Anzhou is very nice.

305
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
Sweet tea brings over beauty.

306
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,200
Brings over beauty.

307
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,160
That's a good name.

308
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,480
What's good about it?

309
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,640
It's good...

310
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,360
It sounds expensive.

311
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,720
I want to call it Anzhou Sweetie.

312
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,720
Anzhou Sweetie?

313
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,760
It's also a good name.

314
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,040
If you were me,

315
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,440
what name would you have?

316
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,120
Why would I...?

317
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,240
I... I'll think of a name

318
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,200
that also sounds wonderful.

319
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,560
Wait a minute.

320
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,120
Yueji Tea.

321
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,480
Yueji Tea?

322
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,600
Why?

323
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,760
My old inn

324
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,800
was Yueji Inn.

325
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,960
And I often say,

326
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,240
"Ai Sixi loves herself."

327
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,560
Yueji means "love oneself".

328
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,880
That's right.

329
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
It'll be Anzhou Sweetie.

330
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,180
Since you've decided,

331
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,040
why did you ask me?

332
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,040
Trying to respect your opinion.

333
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,320
Respect my opinion.

334
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,800
Let me have more.

335
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,960
Tastes good, indeed.

336
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,680
It does, huh?

337
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,400
Glad to hear that.

338
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,760
It's Anzhou Sweetie.

339
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,580
(Hongzhou Bailu, Wuzhixiang)

340
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,320
Here, Guiwei. Have some more.

341
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
Lady Shuangxi, stop drinking.

342
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,280
It's too late. Even the day will break.

343
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,760
So what?

344
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,720
Before I'm done,

345
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,360
this day will never end.

346
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,160
Come on, man.

347
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
Why do you sigh all the time?

348
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,640
Actually, when I think about it,

349
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,320
Xue Muyun is quite pathetic.

350
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
She doesn't have feelings for me.

351
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,240
I just look like...

352
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,040
Forget it. I'll say no more.

353
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
Right.

354
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
In her most vulnerable time

355
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,600
when she needed care most,

356
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,120
you happened to appear.

357
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,560
I think

358
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
it's kind of destiny.

359
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,160
Isn't it, Guiwei?

360
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,240
Come on, Wei Shuangxi.

361
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,800
You don't really care, huh?

362
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,640
It's you who said she was pathetic.

363
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,120
I... She is pathetic,

364
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,440
but I don't care about her.

365
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,240
Do the two things conflict?

366
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,350
And I was just saying. But you...

367
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,720
All right.

368
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,720
That came out wrong.

369
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
I'll punish myself.

370
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
You just want more wine.

371
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,740
Wei Shuangxi,

372
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,260
I was captured from the street.

373
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,960
What if you wouldn't see me again?

374
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
What if you live happily

375
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,480
after you are captured?

376
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,280
Fine.

377
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,760
Good for you, Wei Shuangxi.

378
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,130
Now, in front of Guiwei,

379
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,520
I'll give up my dignity

380
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,720
and ask you one thing.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,680
Do you or do you not care about me?

382
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,280
See it in the wine.

383
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,200
In your heart,

384
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
not in your wine.

385
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,910
You guys enjoy yourselves. I should go.

386
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,860
Sit back there!

387
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,040
Wei Shuangxi.

388
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,240
Say something.

389
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,040
I'm really confused.

390
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,880
Haven't we had a great time?

391
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,560
Why must you get everything straight?

392
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
Isn't it meaningless?

393
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,880
How could this thing

394
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,120
be meaningless?

395
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,240
And you're a woman.

396
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,960
Shouldn't you care more about this?

397
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,440
Stop. Stop right there.

398
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,960
It has nothing to do with gender.

399
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,620
People just have different choices

400
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,880
and understandings of life.

401
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,360
At first, you got drunk

402
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,200
and did that to me.

403
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,200
Then, you got drunk

404
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
and did that again.

405
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,600
Then, again and again, you and I...

406
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
But now you're pretending

407
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
none of this happened.

408
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,720
When did I say

409
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,640
nothing had happened?

410
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,440
Don't be ridiculous, will you?

411
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I'm being ridiculous?

412
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,840
I'm being ridiculous...

413
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,960
Am I being ridiculous?

414
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
Stop.

415
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,800
You stop talking

416
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,840
and stop drinking.

417
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,200
You nag after you drink.

418
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,120
I'll get you water.

419
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,600
I want warm water.

420
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,400
Guiwei, he wants warm water.

421
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,360
Go get some for him.

422
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,960
(Anping Bridge Shop)
Wei Shuangxi.

423
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,960
Wei Shuangxi!

424
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,840
Stop right there!

425
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,040
Wei Shuangxi!

426
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,120
Was I ridiculous?

427
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,040
Was I being ridiculous?

428
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
I just want to be her man.

429
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,520
What's wrong with that?

430
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,760
Yeah.

431
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
Well, what on earth

432
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,760
is your relationship?

433
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,520
Why am I so confused?

434
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,720
You can't be...

435
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,720
We're a serious...

436
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,480
Guiwei,

437
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,440
did you understand what I was saying?

438
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
Yes.

439
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,860
Even a man like you understood,

440
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,720
but she didn't!

441
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
That was quite intentional.

442
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,220
(Quiet and Beautiful)

443
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,640
Zhenzhu,

444
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,080
you dine with us every day.

445
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,680
We can't eat anymore.

446
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,000
When on earth will you

447
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,720
get back to Lin Donglin?

448
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,680
Get back to him?

449
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm not insane.

450
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,360
I'm so relaxed without love.

451
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,680
Tonight, as usual,

452
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,240
we'll get hammered.

453
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,480
When will it be over?

454
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,960
Don't bother.

455
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,720
Zhenzhu.

456
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,760
What again?

457
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,960
I have another invitation tonight.

458
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Can I...?

459
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Get them here.

460
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,360
I can't.

461
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,600
Then, stop struggling.

462
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,680
Let's go.

463
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,040
Eat some more.

464
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,040
No problem.

465
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,120
You...

466
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,440
Who's that?

467
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,040
You'll have a no-lose deal with us.

468
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,020
Suzhou Mifang Pastry...

469
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,360
Having lunch, huh?

470
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,680
Are you here for me?

471
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,360
Why would I?

472
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
I'm quite busy.

473
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,200
Let's go. Come on.

474
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,120
Why are the dishes served so slowly?

475
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,600
Wait a minute.

476
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,320
Did you order this?

477
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,880
No.

478
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,200
We didn't order this.

479
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,840
I won't pay for it.

480
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
Mr. Lin ordered it for you.

481
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,360
These are our new dishes
for this season.

482
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,840
You can use Mr. Lin's account

483
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
in this restaurant.

484
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,240
Lin Donglin is generous.

485
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah. You'll have a lot to eat.

486
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,920
Take them away.

487
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,720
Don't hesitate.

488
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,760
Take them away.

489
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,920
Zhenzhu, what's wrong?

490
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,080
Yeah.

491
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,560
He used to use your money.

492
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,160
Now, you deserve

493
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
to use his money.

494
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,280
Use his money?

495
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,160
I'm not that shameless.

496
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
He's just parading his wealth.

497
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,360
Zhenzhu,

498
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,500
as your friend,

499
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,880
I'd like to remind you.

500
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,440
He is a live-in husband,

501
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,160
but now, he has his own business.

502
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,400
Shouldn't you change

503
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,320
your attitude?

504
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,680
What's wrong with it?

505
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm being nice.

506
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,920
Hey, are you my friend?

507
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,360
Why do you defend him instead?

508
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,920
Qinghua is right.

509
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,520
When he used your money,

510
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,840
you could control him.

511
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,320
Now, he's rich.

512
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,800
You can't control him anymore.

513
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,280
In this case,

514
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,560
you definitely feel bad.

515
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,700
Yeah. But you have to accept that.

516
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,640
You don't want to dine, huh?

517
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,760
We want you to think positively.

518
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,000
Go out.

519
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,960
Move. You have things to do.

520
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,400
Fine. I have a dinner to attend.

521
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,920
I'll leave you alone.

522
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,080
Let's go.

523
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,160
Close the door.

524
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,360
Zhenzhu.

525
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,840
Why are you here?

526
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,940
I want to talk to you

527
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,160
in a regular temper.

528
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,740
All right. I also wanted

529
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,920
a regular talk.

530
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,040
But you did things

531
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,200
to slap me in the face.

532
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,880
How could I calm down?

533
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,880
I don't know why you're mad at this.

534
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,760
I used to be poor

535
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,320
and couldn't bring you honor.

536
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,400
Now, I'm rich.

537
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,580
I want you to look good
in front of your friends.

538
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
Nothing is wrong, huh?

539
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,120
Have you even thought about me?

540
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,240
I thought about you,

541
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
and so I did this.

542
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Tell me, Lin Donglin.

543
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,840
When you were poor,

544
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,320
I could give you some money.

545
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,800
But now, you're rich.

546
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,680
Why are you still with me?

547
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,400
Come on.

548
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,440
We're a couple.

549
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,960
We love each other.

550
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,080
What's that question?

551
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,880
Love exists on conditions.

552
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,520
Before, I could offer something

553
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,480
for our relationship.

554
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,120
But you no longer need that.

555
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,720
It means

556
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,680
I have

557
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,760
no use for you anymore.

558
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,040
Don't you understand?

559
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,920
Indeed.

560
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Marrying you

561
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,280
really gave my aunt

562
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,520
a better life.

563
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,440
But I married you

564
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,560
because I loved you.

565
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,200
I want to be with you all my life.

566
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,040
Don't kid yourself, will you?

567
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,920
Lin Donglin,

568
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,600
you know very well

569
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
what kind of person I am.

570
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,960
Then do you know

571
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,800
what sort of man I am?

572
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,760
Of course.

573
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,720
So, you're doing all these things

574
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,880
just to humiliate me.

575
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
Zhenzhu,

576
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,660
if I hadn't achieved

577
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,440
this little bit of success,

578
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,340
would I always be

579
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,760
this sort of man in your heart?

580
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,240
And I wouldn't even know that.

581
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes.

582
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,600
You're right.

583
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,920
So, your so-called care and concern

584
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,840
would be a charity to me.

585
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,520
I don't like it or need it.

586
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,900
What do you need me to do? Tell me

587
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
and I'll do it.

588
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,300
- What do you want?
- Get out.

589
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,440
Out!

590
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,280
Mother.

591
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,440
Mother.

592
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,860
I'm back.

593
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Zhenzhu.

594
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,200
Slow down.

595
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Be careful.

596
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
Come on.

597
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
Why did you drink so much again?

598
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,480
I was happy

599
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,520
and I drank a lot.

600
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
Every time you get drunk,

601
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,840
you look

602
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,600
more like your father.

603
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,610
Mother,

604
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm not like him.

605
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
I don't hit anyone when I'm drunk.

606
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,480
Zhenzhu,

607
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,200
get back to Donglin.

608
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,880
You always get drunk

609
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,960
and hurt yourself.

610
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,600
It breaks my heart.

611
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,920
If you're no longer angry,

612
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,720
do something actively.

613
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,200
All right?

614
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Was I not active?

615
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,080
Was I not active enough?

616
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,800
Why do I have to be active?

617
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,120
I know you're trying to persuade me

618
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,600
just because he has become

619
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,720
a rich man.

620
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,280
That's not what I care for.

621
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,280
I just think Donglin

622
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,000
has true feelings for you.

623
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,920
Think about it, Zhenzhu.

624
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
If one day,

625
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,120
Mother is dead

626
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,480
and you don't have a man around,

627
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,800
what will you do?

628
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,800
Did you live a good life

629
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,920
when you had a husband?

630
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,760
What about me?

631
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,400
When I was little,

632
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,200
other children

633
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
could sit on their father's shoulders

634
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,720
to watch fireworks,

635
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
stars, and the moon.

636
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,600
Every summer,

637
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,000
I watched other kids

638
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,120
when their fathers took them

639
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,280
to catch fish or frogs in the fields.

640
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,320
You had no idea how jealous I was.

641
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,360
What did I have then?

642
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,840
At midnight

643
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
every day,

644
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,040
a drunk man

645
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,680
came into the room and smashed things.

646
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,080
I didn't dare to close my eyes.

647
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,160
How could I?

648
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,840
What if I closed my eyes,

649
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,080
a vase was thrown at me,

650
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,040
and I would never open my eyes again?

651
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
So,

652
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,440
I think it's good

653
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,280
when my father is gone.

654
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,720
Not everyone

655
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,640
needs a wife or a husband.

656
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,280
Zhenzhu.

657
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm sorry.

658
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,720
It's my bad.

659
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,000
I didn't give you

660
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,880
a warm home.

661
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,680
There you go again!

662
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,040
Because you were a coward,

663
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,800
my father behaved like that

664
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,520
and I ended up like this.

665
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,280
But... But you're good, Zhenzhu.

666
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,040
I'm not good!

667
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,760
Zhenzhu.

668
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,440
Zhenzhu.

669
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
Ruan, it's wrong.

670
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,160
Yeah.

671
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,300
I was wrong.

672
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,280
You arranged it wrong.

673
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,200
Right.

674
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,520
I did it wrong.

675
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,080
The wrong twig, I mean.

676
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,360
Ruan,

677
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,320
I misunderstood you.

678
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,960
I only knew yesterday

679
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,760
what Lady Shuangxi did to you.

680
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Don't tell anyone.

681
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,320
All right.

682
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,440
Recently, life has taught me

683
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,680
that we can't force

684
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,880
in some cases.

685
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,520
I've made up my mind.

686
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
I won't pester Wei Shuangxi anymore.

687
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,480
Wait, wait.

688
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,520
Where's your energy?

689
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,120
You must cheer up.

690
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,200
Do you or do you not

691
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,280
want to be with her?

692
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,120
- I...
- Don't hesitate.

693
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,280
Tell me how you truly feel.

694
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,120
Do you or do you not?

695
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,120
- I do.
- Then, tell her.

696
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,040
You know what? Don't make a woman think.

697
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,080
You'll let her know.

698
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,320
You should say it out.

699
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,320
Ms. Shuangxi, are you in there?

700
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Yes.

701
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,120
May I come in?

702
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,760
Come in.

703
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,200
Ms. Shuangxi,

704
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm here

705
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,680
because I honestly want

706
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,720
to discuss our future

707
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,480
with you.

708
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,320
You...

709
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,480
Why are you so weird?

710
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,000
As the poem says,

711
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,200
"If we love someone,

712
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,160
we will never leave each other.

713
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,160
Love should be tender,

714
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,640
love should be ardent."

715
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,800
Ms. Shuangxi,

716
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
this is a jade pendant

717
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,360
I struggled to find.

718
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,040
If you agree to spend

719
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
your life with me,

720
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,400
please accept it.

721
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,080
If you don't,

722
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,680
please reject it.

723
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,320
Indeed.

724
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,120
We should get everything straight.

725
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,720
But anyway,

726
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,000
can you behave normally?

727
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,120
I promise.

728
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,520
I won't run away this time.

729
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,560
I'm quite relieved

730
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,960
to hear that.

731
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,640
Then...

732
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,320
Don't stand there.

733
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,160
Shall we sit down and talk?

734
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,960
I'm willing to.

735
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,320
This way, please.

736
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,480
First,

737
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,160
I do like you.

738
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,800
I like you.

739
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,240
Second,

740
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,120
I can be your couple.

741
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,120
So, you'll accept me?

742
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,160
However,

743
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,120
I can't marry you now.

744
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,600
What?

745
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,720
But everything was going nicely.

746
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,880
Why?

747
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,080
If you can't accept that,

748
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,320
I'm afraid

749
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,520
I can't accept this.

750
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,640
But...

751
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,880
Does anything of mine

752
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,760
still worry you?

753
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,600
It's not your problem.

754
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,000
It's my problem.

755
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,680
If we get married,

756
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,720
we'll face more responsibilities.

757
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,440
Actually, I'm scared.

758
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
Such responsibilities

759
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,640
may restrain us.

760
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,160
Think about it.

761
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,400
When getting married,

762
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,600
people love to say

763
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,920
how happy

764
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,280
their life will be.

765
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,680
But it may not be true.

766
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,320
A married couple

767
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
will face more difficulties
and challenges.

768
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,360
We'll also have more fights,

769
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,600
contradictions,

770
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,320
and complaints.

771
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,880
I don't want such a bad ending.

772
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,480
No, no, no.

773
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,900
Before you even try it,

774
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,200
how do you know it won't be good?

775
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,880
Last time,

776
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,880
because of this saying,

777
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,440
I experienced

778
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,600
a bad marriage.

779
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,560
You can't always...

780
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,060
I said everything

781
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
from my heart.

782
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,880
If possible,

783
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,560
I would love

784
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
to be with you.

785
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
However long it may last.

786
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,120
But if you don't agree,

787
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,920
I can understand.

788
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,320
Then, this is where

789
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,040
we will break up.

790
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,440
I understand.

791
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,240
I understand now.

792
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,800
Shuangxi,

793
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,840
from this day on,

794
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,040
I won't pester you anymore.
