(Fancy Dishes)

26
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,280
Let's break up.

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,720
Why?

28
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,160
Don't ask.

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,090
Tell me the truth.

30
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,170
Yingxi,

31
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,720
we're not right for each other.

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,180
Do you just think

33
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,140
I'm too old for you?

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,450
Then why did you pursue me?

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,210
What's gone
is the past.

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,110
These days

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,400
when we've been getting along,

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,070
I can't feel any connection

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,280
in our spirits.

40
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,520
You're a nice woman.

41
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,890
But sometimes,

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,990
I just feel

43
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,050
we're like strangers.

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,280
Do you insist?

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,650
When love is gone, it's gone.

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,730
I refuse.

47
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,050
Grow up, Yingxi.

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,800
You can't break up with me.

49
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,890
Because...

50
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,280
Because I was pregnant.

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,170
I'm carrying your baby.

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,720
Carrying my baby?

53
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,610
Come on.

54
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,270
We just held hands

55
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,270
and drank together.

56
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,860
We didn't even spend a night together.

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,890
I even think we're just friends.

58
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,490
Why are you pregnant?

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,560
Good. Glad you admit it.

60
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,790
Admit what?

61
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,490
Who would even believe that?

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,330
They all believe me.

63
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,540
(Jing Residence)

64
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,680
Lady Shuangxi.

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,640
Where is she?

66
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,790
Lady Shuangxi,

67
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,800
why didn't you come today?

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,840
Where do you mean?

69
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,280
Our shop. The wine thing.

70
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,460
Your general manager

71
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,460
doesn't welcome me.

72
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,650
And he's sharp-tongued.

73
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,730
General manager?

74
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,000
It really upsets me.

75
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,350
I don't know why Kan

76
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,770
makes him the general manager.

77
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,300
He's lazy and arrogant.

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,400
He just acts all the time
in front of Sixi and Kan.

79
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,440
Lady Shuangxi.

80
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,600
Let me tell you the truth.

81
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,210
I appear to be the manager of the shop,

82
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,960
but I have my own secret mission.

83
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,770
To watch over him.

84
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,990
I must find evidence

85
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,090
of his unfaithful behaviors.

86
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,570
Work hard, then.

87
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,970
Come on.

88
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,170
Join me, please.

89
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,600
How will that benefit me?

90
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,720
Freshly brewed Qiulu Wine.

91
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,650
It's especially for you.

92
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,130
Well, it's not for the wine.

93
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,090
Now, I really

94
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,330
want to help you catch him.

95
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,650
Let's move, then.

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,620
- Let's go.
- Go.

97
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,010
What took you so long?

98
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,200
Am I late?

99
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,480
I was asking Guiwei.

100
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,690
Don't flatter yourself.

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,200
Guiwei,

102
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,940
Supervisor Lei sent a message

103
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,780
of the new delivery.

104
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,130
Go to the North Warehouse for it.

105
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,840
I'll go alone?

106
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,000
If we go together,

107
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,330
will she tend the shop?

108
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,500
Why is it always me?

109
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,450
Because I'm the general manager.

110
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,030
Fine.

111
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,010
Now I can see.

112
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,380
You want to send me away

113
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,550
and then slacken off,

114
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,490
right?

115
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,880
Alright.

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,770
Do whatever you want today.

117
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,170
You know what?

118
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,890
I'll come back very late tonight.

119
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,210
Very late.

120
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,800
You're doomed.

121
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,910
See?

122
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,810
He asked you to watch over me.

123
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,480
You reek of alcohol.

124
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,320
I'll open the window for fresh air.

125
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,050
Me?

126
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,420
But a man like you

127
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,500
even reeks of flowers.

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,010
Why? To cover up

129
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,210
you own smell?

130
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,980
(Prison)

131
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,930
Auntie.

132
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,470
Aji.

133
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,450
How was it doing?

134
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,170
That was so cruel.

135
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,500
How could they lock you up

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,470
for the whole night?

137
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,920
Did they hurt you?

138
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,000
No.

139
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,400
What about that woman?

140
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,330
Young Master Aji, don't worry.

141
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,500
This woman

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,820
and her baby

143
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,300
won't threaten you anymore.

144
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,240
That's great.

145
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,160
There's always justice.

146
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,040
Justice doesn't need to help.

147
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,180
When Madam took action,

148
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,520
it was solved immediately.

149
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,680
How?

150
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,550
That woman asked for some hush money

151
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,160
and promised she wouldn't keep the baby.

152
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,260
She even signed the paper

153
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,090
that she wouldn't tell anyone.

154
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,310
Nor would she say

155
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,600
you were the baby's father.

156
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,290
You...

157
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,620
You gave her money?

158
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,560
Aji,

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,480
I'll let nothing bother you

160
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,400
unless money fails.

161
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,650
Auntie!

162
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
Isn't it another way

163
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,380
to admit my mistake?

164
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,230
Aji,

165
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,650
just learn your lesson.

166
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,130
Next time you are in love,

167
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,290
tell me about it.

168
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,520
Marriage isn't child's play.

169
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,690
Don't be casual about the love thing.

170
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,290
Auntie.

171
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,050
I'm not the baby's father.

172
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,260
Alright, alright.

173
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,600
Come on, master.

174
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,210
And who are you?

175
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,010
What's your problem?

176
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,690
Dispel the misfortune.

177
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,900
Dispel the misery.

178
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,860
One last move.

179
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,660
- Dispel the trouble.
- I'm innocent.

180
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,590
Good boy.

181
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,120
Remove his old clothes.

182
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,020
Alright.

183
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,860
- Young Master.
- Cuiying.

184
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,990
- Just a minute.
- What?

185
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,020
Just a minute.

186
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,960
Just be obedient.

187
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,290
What are you trying to do?

188
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,840
Don't look back.

189
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,260
Don't go backward.

190
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,470
Don't look back.

191
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,230
The future is bright.

192
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,690
- Life will be peaceful.
- Don't look back!

193
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,510
Sir,

194
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,850
is there fancy...?

195
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,100
It's you, Wei Shuangxi.

196
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,640
My divorced wife.

197
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,480
What are you doing here?

198
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,050
So, this is where you're hiding.

199
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,690
I looked for you for a long time.

200
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,080
What for?

201
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,930
Don't you remember?

202
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,380
You fought my family

203
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,170
and I'm coming for you.

204
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,640
I dare you to touch me.

205
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,810
I touched you before.

206
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,810
Don't play innocent.

207
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,960
I should give you a good lesson.

208
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,600
You're being rebellious.

209
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,930
Kneel now.

210
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,500
I may reconsider

211
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,880
making you my concubine.

212
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,950
After all, you are

213
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,930
living alone...

214
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,740
"Now, you can

215
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,880
call me Master,

216
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,450
my concubine."

217
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,010
Who are you?

218
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,530
Have a death wish?

219
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,560
So, you can fight.

220
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,890
Bring it on.

221
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,450
You haven't seen the real moves yet.

222
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,660
(Jinyu Tea)

223
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,530
Thank you for that.

224
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,530
It's nothing.

225
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,960
Why did you flaunt
when you couldn't even fight?

226
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,600
Who said that?

227
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,350
If I hadn't jumped

228
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,380
and missed the punch,

229
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,640
he would be knocked down.

230
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,410
Didn't you see him flee in panic?

231
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,530
Come on.

232
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,140
He was arrested by the constables.

233
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,000
That's the same.

234
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,380
When I think about it now,

235
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,450
I really regret it.

236
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,990
I should have punched him

237
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,170
really hard.

238
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,690
But thank you, anyway.

239
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,960
You're welcome.

240
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,240
Impolite customers

241
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,960
are never welcome here.

242
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,410
Actually, I didn't drink

243
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,800
before I married him.

244
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,570
When he had his first concubine,

245
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,200
I could drink

246
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,960
one jin of wine.

247
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,120
When he had the second,

248
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,050
I could drink two jin.

249
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,210
When he had the third...

250
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,530
Three jin?

251
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,250
No.

252
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,590
I told myself

253
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,430
I couldn't just drink

254
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,370
like that.

255
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,000
I had to divorce him.

256
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,210
So, you made it.

257
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,600
Yeah.

258
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,480
I indeed made it.

259
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,740
But I failed

260
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,840
to give up drinking.

261
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,810
I always feel depressed

262
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,000
and don't know how to vent it.

263
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,800
I don't have a choice.

264
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,410
All I can do is drink.

265
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,690
You can't go on like this.

266
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,190
You just can't.

267
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,530
You must vent your depression.

268
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,720
Or you'll get sick.

269
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,900
How can I vent it?

270
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,780
To divorce him again?

271
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Some advice for you.

272
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,780
Pretend I'm Tong Sanwen.

273
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,180
Then scold me.

274
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,700
Don't be kidding.

275
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,620
I'm serious.

276
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,100
It's you, Wei Shuangxi,

277
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,780
my divorced wife.

278
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,500
Am I in character

279
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,460
too quickly?

280
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,380
No.

281
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,380
You did a good job.

282
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,380
Keep up like that.

283
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,060
I, Tong Sanwen,

284
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,660
will make your life a living hell.

285
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,340
You fail to scold me, right?

286
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,180
Alright.

287
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,180
I'm giving you the chance now.

288
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,540
Scold me as hard as you can.

289
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,900
I said, scold.

290
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,940
I...

291
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,860
I said...

292
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,140
I didn't say...

293
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,100
Fine, fine.

294
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,420
Let's just drink.

295
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,380
Drinking isn't that bad.

296
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,820
Or we'll end up miserable.

297
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,780
Do you need to see a doctor?

298
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,140
No need.

299
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,260
Are your organs all right?

300
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,380
I'm fine.

301
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,100
Just minor injuries.

302
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,820
(Exquisite Tea)

303
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,060
What?

304
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,860
Aji sneaked out

305
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,460
to see Zhao Yingxi?

306
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,420
He did.

307
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,380
He watched from afar.

308
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,820
He didn't dare to get close.

309
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,460
He just...

310
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,380
He just watched with eager eyes.

311
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,260
Oh no.

312
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,140
What does he like about her?

313
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,420
It's hard to tell.

314
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,660
But as you can see, Madam,

315
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,660
Young Master Aji has been depressed

316
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,900
since he came back.

317
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,940
Aji must be

318
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,540
hating Zhao Yingxi.

319
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
When Young Master Aji

320
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,940
got out of jail,

321
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,300
he was excited.

322
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,780
But think about it.

323
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,620
When was he so excited

324
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,540
about another woman?

325
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,780
He must be hating her
because he still loves her.

326
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,020
Still loves her?

327
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,660
In this case,

328
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,940
should I not force Aji

329
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,420
and Zhao Yingxi to...?

330
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
Madam, I think you did the right thing.

331
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,660
That woman appears

332
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,540
to be very bad.

333
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,420
She's bad, indeed.

334
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,860
And she's close to many men.

335
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,300
- That's right.
- As time goes by,

336
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,580
she'll hinder Young Master Aji.

337
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,500
But...

338
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,500
But Aji loves her.

339
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,620
What do I do?

340
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,060
Then...

341
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,020
Madam,

342
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,780
will you bring them together?

343
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,860
No way.

344
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,820
If Aji marries

345
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,740
this kind of woman,

346
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,180
his life will be ruined.

347
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,700
I won't let that happen.

348
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,020
- Go.
- What do you want?

349
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,100
Let me go.

350
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,020
Be gentle.

351
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,620
Be gentle, please.

352
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,820
Madam,

353
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,300
we had a deal.

354
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,540
What's all this about?

355
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,900
I will not

356
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
beat about the bush.

357
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,020
To be honest,

358
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,900
I want you to do one thing.

359
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,780
Leave Luo Aji immediately.

360
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,020
- Yes, yes.
- I get it.

361
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
I can't believe
you let it go so quickly.

362
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,020
You've got a new date so soon.

363
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,420
To be honest,

364
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,020
I have a husband.

365
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,340
What?

366
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,060
After you and Aji were together,

367
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,020
you got married?

368
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,260
No.

369
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,860
I got married

370
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,140
before I knew him.

371
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,660
What do you mean?

372
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,940
Madam, she means

373
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,860
Young Master Aji wormed in

374
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,940
and broke her family.

375
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,780
I understood.

376
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,900
But Aji isn't aware.

377
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,660
So, the baby you're carrying...

378
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,780
It's my husband's baby.

379
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,060
You're really shameless.

380
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,940
I'm not her husband.

381
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,900
Nonsense!

382
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,340
I stalked you for a couple of days.

383
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,540
You live together.

384
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,740
We do live together,

385
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
but he isn't my husband.

386
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,900
They're two different things.

387
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,940
How could you be so promiscuous?

388
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,700
Shame on you.

389
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,220
Sorry, sorry.

390
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
We were wrong.

391
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,660
We won't mess around anymore.

392
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,100
Take them away.

393
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,260
Don't kill me!

394
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,140
Don't kill us!

395
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,700
- Don't kill us.
- Wait.

396
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Kill you?

397
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,580
You wish.

398
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,140
It will get our hands dirty.

399
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,340
That's right.

400
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,100
The carriage is ready for you.

401
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
You'll leave Taiping County immediately.

402
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,820
I will also give you

403
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,020
a settlement allowance.

404
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,900
Madam, can we have the money separately?

405
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,380
Don't be ridiculous.

406
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,420
Get lost.

407
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,100
- Go.
- Be gentle.

408
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,140
- Be gentle.
- Let me go!

409
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,420
How shameless.

410
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,860
So, they really

411
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,420
fooled Aji.

412
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,260
Young Master Aji said that,

413
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,980
but we didn't believe him.

414
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,500
Then I don't understand

415
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,180
why he always stalks her.

416
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,660
They loved, after all.

417
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,620
Like you said,

418
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,660
Young Master Aji is sentimental.

419
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,220
I guess he can't let it go.

420
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Make some arrangements.

421
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,380
Have this man and this woman

422
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,860
explain everything to Aji.

423
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,460
Yes.

424
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,380
Make Aji give up on her.

425
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,820
Yes.

426
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,580
(Jinyu Tea)

427
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,900
Why are the lights still on?

428
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,220
What's going on?

429
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,260
Ruan Ling?

430
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,500
Lady Shuangxi?

431
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
No one is in.

432
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,420
They didn't fight, huh?

433
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,820
Today, I believed what Guiwei said

434
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,100
and hated you so much.

435
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I'm going to kill you!

436
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,460
I said, watch over him.

437
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,660
Did I say, "kill him"?

438
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,220
Wait.

439
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,260
Lady Shuangxi can't beat him.

440
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,620
How come you believed Guiwei?

441
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,900
Fine. I'm going to screw you.

442
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,740
Has anything happened?

443
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,940
(Jinyu Tea)

444
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,260
Why do my head and my back hurt?

445
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Where am I?

446
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,220
Why am I here with her?

447
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,620
Wake up. Wake up.

448
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,740
Lady Shuangxi.

449
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,740
Wake up.

450
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,420
Wake up.

451
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,980
She can't be dead, huh?

452
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,060
Wake up now.

453
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,140
My Lady, are you in there?

454
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,180
My Lady.

455
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,020
I...

456
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,900
Yes, yes. I'm in here.

457
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,940
Don't come in now.

458
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,900
I'm not dressed yet.

459
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,220
Just...Just tell me.

460
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,420
Old Lady wished to see you.

461
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,340
I get it.

462
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,820
You go first. I'll be right there.

463
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,540
Don't look.

464
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm sorry.

465
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,340
But...

466
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,900
When did I come here?

467
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,940
How do I know when you came?

468
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,860
You should go now.

469
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,060
I'm going to see my niece.

470
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,140
If people see you,

471
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,060
we'll be in trouble.

472
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,660
Just leave. Go.

473
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
But...

474
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,820
My clothes are in there.

475
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,260
(Yuming Chamber)

476
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,660
Wait for me.

477
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,620
Have you heard?

478
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,460
- What?
- Last night,

479
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,810
Ms. Luo returned again at midnight,

480
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,100
(Yuming Chamber)
out of nowhere.

481
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,420
At midnight? That's late.

482
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,100
I think it's true.

483
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,140
And she...

484
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,500
She quarreled with Old Lady.

485
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,360
Did you hear?

486
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,420
Again? What for?

487
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
I don't know.

488
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,940
She's ridiculous.

489
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,850
She asked me to leave,

490
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,900
but where's the exit?

491
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,740
Please make sure they'll lose

492
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,860
and we'll then have a chance.

493
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,340
Or how about you give me a hint

494
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,260
and tell me what you think?

495
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,100
Mingxia,

496
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,740
get me some incense sticks.

497
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,340
Mingxia?

498
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,020
What a maid.

499
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,500
Mingxia.

500
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,180
Oh my gosh.

501
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,940
Oh no.

502
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,780
Who are you?

503
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,260
Sorry for this.

504
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,860
Where is the exit, please?

505
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,500
Thank you.

506
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,780
Who are you?

507
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,220
Who was that guy?

508
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,260
Stop right there.

509
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,700
Where were you last night?

510
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,180
Are you all right?

511
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,820
I'm all right.

512
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,460
Why are you taller?

513
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,900
Where are your feet?

514
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,660
Where is the other boot?

515
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,460
Yeah. Where is that boot?

516
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,300
Don't ask me.

517
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,420
Is Lady Shuangxi all right?

518
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,500
She...

519
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,660
How do I know?

520
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,380
You were together last night.

521
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,220
Don't ask.

522
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,460
I just won't answer.

523
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,900
(Tea)

524
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,220
There he is.

525
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,820
(Fish Noodles, Noodles)

526
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,100
Sir, I'll borrow it.

527
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,180
- Why?
- I'll return it soon.

528
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,580
Let's go.

529
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,940
Come on.

530
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,900
Very well,

531
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,620
you evil couple.

532
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,340
I've been looking for you.

533
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,340
How dare you ask to see me?

534
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,260
Luo Aji,

535
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,180
let me be honest.

536
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,700
The baby isn't yours.

537
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,980
I certainly know that.

538
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,580
Why do you laugh?

539
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,500
Is the baby yours?

540
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,380
No. I'm promiscuous.

541
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,660
You sound really proud.

542
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
Also,

543
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,700
she's married.

544
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,620
With you?

545
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,540
No, no, no.

546
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,740
I advise you

547
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,900
to let it go as soon as possible!

548
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,220
Why on earth did you

549
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,460
take him here?

550
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,900
To humiliate me?

551
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,420
We're here to tell you.

552
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,100
I'm not worth loving!

553
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,900
Don't stalk me anymore!

554
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,420
Pah. I love you?

555
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,500
Why would I love you?

556
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,660
For your plain face?

557
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,660
Let me tell you.

558
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,580
I was just stalking you

559
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,460
to find something

560
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,340
and prove my innocence.

561
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,700
That'd be great.

562
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,220
Aji.

563
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Look.

564
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,180
It's just a misunderstanding.

565
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,740
Now, we know the truth.

566
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,780
We'll...

567
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,820
We'll take our leave.

568
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,900
Bye. Let's go.

569
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,740
- Ridiculous.
- Go.

570
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,260
Auntie?

571
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Let's get out of here.

572
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,220
Aji,

573
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,340
what a coincidence.

574
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,820
They...

575
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,100
You sent them, right?

576
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,740
What are you talking about?

577
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,660
Who?

578
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,540
I sent them.

579
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,900
Madam doesn't know anything.

580
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,580
Yes.

581
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,700
I didn't know anything.

582
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,060
What do we do?

583
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,020
Take it back.

584
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,180
Last night,

585
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,420
what happened between you?

586
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,580
Ruan Ling acted weirdly this morning.

587
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,100
No...Nothing happened.

588
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,580
Let's go on today.

589
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,500
No, no, no. Wait.

590
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,700
Wait, Guiwei.

591
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,500
Guiwei,

592
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,660
I thought about it.

593
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,900
It's your business

594
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,020
and I shouldn't interfere.

595
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,900
What?

596
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,260
Don't give up now.

597
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,220
Have some litchi.

598
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,180
Don't move.

599
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,750
What happened? Did he pinch you?

600
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,340
No.

601
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,980
No? There's a mark on your neck.

602
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,260
Will you see a doctor?

603
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,380
No need.

604
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,900
Recently,

605
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,900
I've been ablaze from too much litchi.

606
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,860
If he bullied you, let me know.

607
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,100
- Don't be scared of him.
- No.

608
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,620
I'm really ablaze.

609
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,140
I get it. I'm taking you to him.

610
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,100
Go. I'll do you justice.

611
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,240
No, no. Guiwei.

612
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,220
Come with me.

613
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,420
Guiwei, let me explain.

614
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
Trust me, Lady Shuangxi.

615
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,420
He just has a death wish.

616
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,340
Guiwei, I'm really ablaze.

617
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,380
Listen to me. Come on.

618
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm just being ablaze.

619
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,700
(Anping Bridge)

620
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,740
Well.

621
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,820
First, I'd like to apologize.

622
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,500
Last night, I drank too much

623
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,660
and lost control.

624
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,420
Actually, now,

625
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,660
I can't remember

626
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,100
what exactly happened.

627
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,060
But I never meant to hurt you.

628
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,260
I'm really sorry.

629
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,380
Glad you can see it that way.

630
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,420
But if you have any request,

631
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
I will grant it.

632
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,420
We can be together.

633
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,940
No. This is too plain.

634
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,860
Ms. Shuangxi...

635
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,780
Ruan Ling.

636
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,100
Why did you pinch her?

637
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,220
Who did that?

638
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,900
Who did? Look.

639
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,580
Evidence.

640
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,180
How dare you

641
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,500
hurt Lady Shuangxi?

642
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,180
You also pinched him?

643
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,500
Why did you fight him?

644
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,660
Now, we're in the wrong.

645
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Watch over him,

646
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,100
not fight him.

647
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,820
It makes me feel guilty now.

648
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,580
Guiwei,

649
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,180
Supervisor Lei sent another message

650
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,900
about a new delivery. Go fetch it.

651
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,080
- I'll go with you.
- No.

652
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,900
You have your own task.

653
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,260
Watch over him today.

654
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,860
As long as you get anything on him,

655
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,180
I will complain

656
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,660
when Kan's back.

657
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,060
By then, I'll totally avenge you.

658
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,500
But I...

659
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,540
I know what to do.

660
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,220
The wine is ready for you.

661
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,940
Remember.

662
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
Don't fight him again.

663
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Or you may get hurt.

664
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,740
I should go.

665
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,260
Don't move.

666
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,380
Well, last night...

667
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,660
I'm so sorry about last night.

668
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,580
First, I'd like to apologize.

669
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,820
Last night, I drank too much.

670
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,420
I understand.

671
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
You know,

672
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,740
wine is really...

673
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,980
Yes. This kind of wine

674
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,260
has a strong aftereffect.

675
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,580
I don't remember too many details.

676
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,940
But I...

677
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,340
I didn't mean to.

678
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,100
I'm terribly sorry.

679
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,740
It's alright.

680
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,300
Actually,

681
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,380
after I had the mark, my anger just...

682
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,420
I'm so sorry.

683
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,340
If you think you're aggrieved,

684
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,820
I can make it up to you.

685
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,060
No, no, no.

686
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,220
Are you all right?

687
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,500
I'm fine.

688
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,900
Actually, yesterday,

689
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,580
you really moved me.

690
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,300
Do you mean

691
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,060
when I helped you out?

692
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,020
No.

693
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,500
I mean

694
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,740
when you pretended to be that rascal.

695
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,420
We have just met

696
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,980
and I don't think you will

697
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,060
just be together with me.

698
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,020
I won't.

699
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,460
We're adults, right?

700
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,980
What about you?

701
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,100
See? You don't want this, either.

702
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,100
As the old saying goes,

703
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,300
appetite and lust are only natural.

704
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,940
You don't need to be embarrassed.

705
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,340
That's right.

706
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,220
The old saying is reasonable.

707
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:03,340
(Jinyu Tea Plantation
Anping Bridge)

708
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,380
- Shall we...?
- Yes.

709
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,100
This way, please.

710
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,700
After you.

711
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,660
Well, I....

712
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,580
I must tend the shop.

713
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,740
How about you drink in my room?

714
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,500
I didn't mean anything.

715
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,460
It's just...

716
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,980
I need to do business.

717
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,260
(Heavenly Feathers)

718
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,180
You hit my bone.

719
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
Fine. I'll be gentle.

720
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,940
Dear,

721
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,340
would you like the fruit tart

722
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,820
from Yuxing Pastry?

723
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,180
I'll go buy some for you.

724
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,660
Too gentle.

725
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,900
I remember your favorite filling

726
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,820
is chestnut.

727
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,460
Too hard.

728
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
How about the litchi wine

729
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,740
from Tian's Tavern?

730
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,980
I'll go buy some for you.

731
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,580
Why? Are you out of money again?

732
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,660
What are you talking about?

733
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,140
I've never had any money.

734
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,820
I know very well

735
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,220
what you are up to.

736
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,180
You think I don't know

737
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,100
how much you embezzled from the pastry?

738
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,660
I didn't embezzle money.

739
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,500
I was saving money for you.

740
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,900
How?

741
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,940
Dear, think about it.

742
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,100
We need two taels

743
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
for the resulting pastry.

744
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,920
But if we get the dough

745
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,780
from the flour mill,

746
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,220
get the filling from the sugar shop,

747
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,380
and have it baked,

748
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,180
we'll save four qian in total.

749
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,620
Save money for me?

750
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,380
That's good.

751
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Let me massage your hand.

752
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,740
Give me the money, then.

753
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,660
I spent it.

754
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,380
You did? On what?

755
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,700
On the lotus seedpods for you last time.

756
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,860
Last time?

757
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,140
Lotus seedpods?

758
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,100
Don't you remember? When you drank,

759
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,340
I peeled the lotus seedpods.

760
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,700
How could you forget that?

761
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,500
Are you insane?

762
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,780
Lotus seedpods are all over Shigui Lake.

763
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,940
Why did you buy them?

764
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,220
I'll keep that in mind.

765
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,380
I won't waste money

766
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,460
like that again.

767
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
I'll go get you some tea.

768
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,940
Calm down.

769
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,900
It's nothing.

770
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,100
Back off.

771
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,300
I never complain.

772
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,740
It doesn't mean I don't know.

773
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,580
Behave yourself.

774
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,620
It smells awful.

775
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,540
Wash your feet. Go away.

776
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,740
Alright. Dear, take some rest.

777
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,340
I'll go wash my feet.

778
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,780
Have a good rest.

779
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,700
Get out.

780
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,300
Move it up. Niu, come over.

781
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,380
Come on. Carry it up.

782
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,060
Sir, I'm here to get the tea.

783
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,340
Leave it to me.

784
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,300
But you took it away yesterday.

785
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,980
There's a new delivery, isn't it?

786
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,380
Who told you?

787
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,580
It was...

788
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,460
Come on.

789
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,420
Oh no.

790
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,300
He sent me away.

791
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,540
Cover that up.

792
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,020
Ruan Ling.

793
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
Liar.

794
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,780
You lied to me.
