welcome here.

53

What we emphasize here

54
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,520
is fairness.

55
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,800
You'll get a job accordingly,

56
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,800
whether you're old,
weak, ill, or disabled.

where everything's pure.

You'll have to

62
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,370
keep a good mood.

63
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,210
At least, you must

64
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,930
put me in a good mood.

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,120
Any questions?

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,770
I have a question.

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,720
Is there a twin room?

68
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,120
He and I are quite close.

69
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,730

- No.

No.

- Hurry.
- Ask them

82

- for a room.
- Move.

83

- A twin room.
- Hurry.

- Remember.

86
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,520
It's me, Ruan.

87
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,740
Don't you remember?

88
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,230
I once lived here for some days

89
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,010
and you said
I could sing beautifully.

No.

93
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,810

94
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,360
He's the bad luck.

95
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,600
I just had him.

96

So, you didn't mend your way.

97
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420

98
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,280

can't help you two.

one mustn't have
sweaty hands, body odor,

133
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,010
bad breath,
a runny nose, or nastiness.

134
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,720
Every time before you work,

135
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,600
you'll be taken here for the rolling.

- Wash yourself.

Work.

156
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,240
Work.

- And work.

That's easy.

190
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,720
How could you do this?

191
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,930
What are you doing?

192
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,250
I'm telling you,

193
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,330
the decision can't be changed.

194
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,670
I won't change.

195
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,610
Go and register.

196
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,300
You'll regret it.

197
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,760
Yes, yes. I'm regretting it.

198
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,230
Are you being threatened?

199
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,730
- Yes, yes.
- Carrying.

200
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,810
Do we gather here for tea picking?

201
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,170
New guy, huh?

202
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,350
Yes, yes.

203
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,600
It's my first day of work.

204
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,960
Let me see your hands.

205
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,880
Hands?

206
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,840
They look rough.

207
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,950
Seriously?

208
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,650
It's alright. Sit down.

209
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,680
Sit down here.

210
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,000
Nice to meet you.

211
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,770
For hand washing, huh?

212
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,770
I understand.

213
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,380
Stick a bit longer.

214
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,530
Tell me when it gets cold.

215
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,960
I'll add some hot water.

216
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,560
Alright.

217
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,050
I'm washing really hard.

218
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,930
He's so helpful.

219
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,410
How about I do it myself?

220
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,720
You had lunch, right?

221
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,720
Yes, I did.

222
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,840
Alright, then.

223
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,380
Now, we will

224
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,810
move to the next step.

225
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,480
Alright.

226
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,960
Come on. Put your hands like this.

227
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,680
Like this?

228
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,840
That's right.

229
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,480
Stretch a bit more.

230
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,010
Well done.

231
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,720
What are you doing?

232
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,190
This is just a process.

233
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,760
It's alright. Relax.

234
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,450
Fine.

235
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,880
Tight. Tight, indeed.

236
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,050
You look really experienced.

237
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,570
We're professional.

238
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,350
After it's done,
your fingers will look great.

239
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,900
I don't need

240
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,840
great fingers.

241
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,190
It'll be all right.

242
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,600
Relax. Just relax.

243
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,170
A bit too tight.

244
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,880
It's going to be fine.

245
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,170
Are you ready?

246
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,290
We're starting now.

247
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,840
You haven't started yet?

248
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,480
Pull.

249
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,930
(Finger-binding Room)
It hurts.

250
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,840
It feels so good.

251
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,210
Don't look at me.

252
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,530
I did some work, too.

253
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,240
Gorgeous sunset, indeed.

254
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,330
Why did you drop it here?

255
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,330
Such a dirty thing on the bed.

256
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,690
You're being so impolite.

257
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,380
Darn it.

258
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,320
The fussy guy is back.

259
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,480
I've heard

260
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,090
you came here before.

261
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,370
I did.

262
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,500
So, you knew I needed

263
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,720
finger-binding for tea picking.

264
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,960
But you didn't stop me.

265
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,640
Last time, I also chose wood chopping.

266
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,680
I didn't know.

267
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,800
I just didn't.

268
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,290
No way.

269
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,080
Tomorrow, you tell them

270
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,560
I'll also chop the wood.

271
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,050
It can't change.

272
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,860
Actually...

273
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,110
It's dirty. How could you sit

274
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,050
with such pants on?

275
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,360
Do something for me, please.

276
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,480
Mr. Ruan.

277
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,290
I can do something to help.

278
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,800
Come on.

279
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,530
Sit.

280
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,050
But money is needed.

281
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,200
How much?

282
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,480
- Ten taels.
- Ten taels?

283
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,330
I have no money now.

284
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,290
I owe you 100 taels, right?

285
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,720
Take this for the debt.

286
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,620
I guess

287
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,930
when you go out,

288
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,240
my debt will be paid off.

289
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,690
By then, we'll go our separate ways.

290
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,760
Remember to tell them tomorrow.

291
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,800
Rest assured.

292
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,780
Tonight, sleep by my side.

293
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,170
Right here. I've cleaned it.

294
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,050
What's wrong?

295
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,710
Is it dangerous

296
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,120
to sleep here at night?

297
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,410
Not really.

298
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,760
Because they stink.

299
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,660
What are you doing?

300
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,090
You don't think it's dirty, but I do.

301
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,810
You're so bad-mannered.

302
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,840
I'll go to bed.

303
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,780
Why do you follow me?

304
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,720
Undress and go to bed.

305
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,760
How can I undress?

306
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,190
When you stand in a line,

307
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,330
you must be cautious.

308
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,890
On the two sides

309
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,290
stand two gangs.

310
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,620
The left one

311
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,810
is Pi Laowu Gang.

312
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,540
Pi Laowu is the leader.

313
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,410
It's a local gang from Taiping County.

314
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,570
That's him.

315
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,720
The right one is Qinglong Gang.

316
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,000
Long Er is the leader.

317
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,240
So, he's Long Er.

318
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,370
You know him?

319
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,690
He didn't appreciate my talent.

320
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,660
Then you...

321
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm going to Pi Laowu.

322
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm from Taiping County too.

323
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,650
Are you alright?

324
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,540
Why were you always so impatient?

325
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,840
Even before I could tell you.

326
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,900
Pi Laowu is from Taiping County.

327
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,860
But he hates people

328
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,930
from the Jing Clan.

329
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,440
What do I do, then?

330
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,960
How about

331
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,210
you talk to Long Er?

332
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,210
He's quite easy-going.

333
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,200
Fine.

334
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,360
We'll have to get along, anyway.

335
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,090
I'll go apologize to him.

336
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,410
Didn't you say he was easy-going?

337
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,740
He's easy-going, indeed.

338
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,600
But he hates locals from Taiping County.

339
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,860
Are you tricking me?

340
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,710
No, no, no.

341
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,550
I'm thinking

342
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,960
which side you should take.

343
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,960
It's really hard.

344
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,330
What if I take neither side?

345
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,050
You'll have no food.

346
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,450
Whose side are you on?

347
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,590
I have a background.

348
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,120
I can take either side.

349
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,960
- I'll starve, then.
- Don't.

350
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,120
Why are you so stubborn?

351
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,570
You need food.

352
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,860
You do a lot of work a day.

353
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,360
Without food, you can't carry it all.

354
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,530
Here.

355
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,480
Five taels.

356
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,530
I want half, then.

357
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,770
Alright.

358
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,370
Five taels.

359
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860
For only half?

360
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,880
Do you want it?

361
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,450
I'll take the whole.

362
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,880
Five taels and five taels. Ten in total.

363
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,200
Put it on account.

364
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,570
Do you have food for yourself?

365
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,720
Yes.

366
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,050
What are you looking for?

367
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,720
This is just a little food.

368
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,650
Oh,

369
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,860
there's a letter for you

370
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,800
from Sixi.

371
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,120
Where is it? I'll get it.

372
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,090
You may not be able to get it.

373
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,120
A man like me
can't even get a letter, huh?

374
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,130
Right.

375
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,610
How much?

376
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,040
Five taels.

377
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,240
Let me remind you.

378
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,010
Five taels for half, too.

379
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,570
Dear...

380
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,640
Little Coward.

381
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:55,160
Hope everything is fine
with you and Ruan Ling.

382
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,980
(To my sweetheart)

383
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,090
To my sweetheart?

384
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,770
Thank you, Ruan Ling.

385
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,410
Read it, then.

386
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,740
It's...It's her scent.

387
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,680
So it is.

388
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,400
Dear Little Coward.

389
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,010
That's the nickname
we have for each other.

390
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,440
Don't tell anyone else.

391
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,680
Hope everything is fine
with you and Ruan Ling.

392
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,010
It's about you.

393
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,330
It won't be long

394
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,810
before you come back.

395
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,890
I know.

396
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,010
Talk less but work more.

397
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,330
I miss you.

398
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,730
Why did Sixi write a letter like this?

399
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,400
Because she missed you.

400
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,870
But this isn't the way

401
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,050
she usually talks.

402
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,090
Why did she write this?

403
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,810
Trying to imply something?

404
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,290
Can it be acrostic?

405
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,050
It must be.

406
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,680
Let me see.

407
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,650
Dear,

408
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,090
shall we divorce?

409
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,640
Sixi wants to divorce me?

410
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,170
No way.

411
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,370
Let me see.

412
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,920
Dear, shall...?

413
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,410
Coincidence.

414
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,840
It must be a coincidence.

415
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,680
Maybe it's acrostic in another way.

416
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,920
That's right.

417
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,130
It may be.

418
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,090
Dear, you deserve it.

419
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,090
Nobody reads a letter like that.

420
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,970
You should read like this.

421
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,200
It should be,

422
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,720
"Cute boy."

423
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,650
She called you that.

424
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,570
It doesn't make sense.

425
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,060
You must be thinking too much.

426
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,990
Don't think that much.

427
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,100
Maybe she felt bored

428
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,060
and wrote to you.

429
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,300
Don't think too much.

430
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,240
Right?

431
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,970
Go to sleep.

432
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,850
(Fake.)

433
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,490
(What you feel for me is fake.)

434
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,050
Why is he here again?

435
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,010
Isn't he supposed to do wood chopping?

436
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,970
Let him go.

437
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,020
(Finger-binding Room)

438
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,810
I'm in the wrong place.

439
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:39,180
(Finger-binding Room)

440
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,980
(To my sweetheart)

441
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,230
Another Sixi's letter.

442
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,290
I fetched it for you.

443
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,090
Read it.

444
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,740
It's another acrostic poem.

445
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,680
Let me read it.

446
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,150
Listen. She wrote,

447
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,490
"Dear, we won't divorce."

448
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,390
Look, another hidden message.

449
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,990
It says, "Dear, love you."

450
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,930
Enough.

451
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,410
Don't try to comfort me.

452
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm not comforting you.

453
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,020
Do you know how hard it is

454
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,430
to write an acrostic poem?

455
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,400
Say no more.

456
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,700
(To my sweetheart)

457
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,890
And look.

458
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,770
I'll take this letter back

459
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,250
and tell her in person.

460
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,090
"Yes."

461
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,910
No, Jing Kan. Please don't.

462
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,390
Give me this letter.

463
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,780
- Let's talk about it.
- Go away.

464
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,470
Forget it ever happened.
You must rise up!

465
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,710
- Go away.
- No.

466
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,580
Jing Kan, listen.

467
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,630
- Don't stop me.
- Let me be honest.

468
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,880
- I wrote this letter!
- You...

469
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,020
Ruan Ling.

470
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,200
I know you're lying to me.

471
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,840
And I know you're comforting me.

472
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,150
How can you not believe me?

473
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,090
Why are you fighting?

474
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,090
I heard you fight from far away.

475
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,530
Oh, it's you,

476
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,570
the lame painter.

477
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,200
Mr. Long Er, what brings you here?

478
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,330
Mr. Long,

479
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,730
I think he's holding

480
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,200
something valuable.

481
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,360
What are you holding?

482
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,520
Show it to me.

483
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,530
I'm talking to you.

484
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,390
Mr. Long, it's nothing.

485
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,740
It's just a letter from his wife.

486
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,600
I read it.

487
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,580
I can recite it for you.

488
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,340
Here's another one.
Let's go and read it.

489
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,290
Not interested. Go away!

490
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,150
Show me what you're holding.

491
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,100
I won't.

492
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,090
I insist.

493
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,290
You can hurt me.

494
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,200
But you can't touch my letter.

495
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,890
Mr. Long, look at him.

496
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,470
Now, he can scratch my hand.

497
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,490
Soon, he will slap you.

498
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,630
How dare you start this?

499
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,570
Hey, Mr. Long.

500
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,780
This guy is insane.

501
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,820
He's out of his mind.

502
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,970
Don't let him get to you.

503
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,480
Besides,

504
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,160
we're close, huh?

505
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,130
You touched him.

506
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,870
- Fight them!
- Bring it on!

507
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,810
Hit him!

508
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,840
Come up, all of you.

509
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,960
Hit him.

510
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,290
Hit him. Hit him hard.

511
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,910
Wait, wait. No.

512
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,850
Take it slow.

513
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,090
Come on.

514
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,330
Why did you fight Long Er?

515
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,730
Can you ever beat him up?

516
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,990
You even yelled,

517
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,250
"Bring it on."

518
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,770
You think you're brave?

519
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,880
Look at your bruises.

520
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,640
And look at the bruises

521
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,680
on me.

522
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,330
At least, the letter is safe.

523
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,490
Are you insane?

524
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,360
Which matters most, letter or life?

525
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,360
They're insane, too.

526
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,610
They all hit me.

527
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,280
What does it...?

528
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,770
What does it have to do with me?

529
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,730
You know what?

530
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,880
I need at least 20 taels
for medical treatment.

531
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,040
This is your IOU.

532
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,920
Are you alright?

533
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,490
I was too harsh just now.

534
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,100
Now, we're even

535
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,200
and we'll split up, huh?

536
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,020
All the relatives

537
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,200
and ancestors

538
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,490
of the Jing Clan,

539
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,680
please bless Jing Kan

540
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,400
in the Tribute Tea Plantation.

541
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,100
Hope he'll have food and clothes,

542
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,050
and won't be bullied.

543
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,850
Please bless him.

544
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,520
Alright.

545
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,090
Apparition?

546
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,570
Alright.

547
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,600
Wake up. Wake up.

548
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,020
What is your problem?

549
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,120
How could you drink here?

550
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,400
I won't drink, then.

551
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,010
- You drink.
- No.

552
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,200
Get up. What if people see you?

553
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,090
I can't drink anymore.

554
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,680
I'll leave you alone.

555
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,360
I don't owe you this.

556
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,640
Come on.

557
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,250
One, two, go.

558
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,130
Oh no.

559
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,120
One, two, go.

560
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,570
I eat really a lot every day.

561
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,160
But why am I so weak?

562
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,770
You need to drink.

563
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,290
I won't. Just stop it.

564
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,390
50-year-old Jinhua Wine

565
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,990
I've brought back

566
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,680
from Tong Residence.

567
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,880
Would you like some?

568
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,650
(Tablet of Jing Dayou
Tablet of Jing Nanfeng)

569
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,360
Why do I have to work so late?

570
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,970
They look great.

571
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,370
Why must I change?

572
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,600
The apple looks good, too.

573
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,770
Sweet and juicy.

574
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,600
Why were they bitten?

575
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,520
Who did this?

576
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,730
What happened?

577
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,570
How dare you?

578
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,630
You made a scene

579
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,360
in the ancestral hall!

580
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,360
You made a scene?

581
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,970
- I was with you.
- You.

582
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,010
Since you were divorced,

583
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,490
you've always been sprawling.

584
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,200
You either drink or sleep.

585
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,570
For a mere man,

586
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,120
you're abandoning yourself.

587
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,400
He isn't the reason I drink.

588
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,440
Jinhua wine tastes great.

589
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,810
Don't find an excuse.

590
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,330
No wonder you were divorced.

591
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,680
And you.

592
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,290
You don't like her, do you?

593
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,910
Why did the two of you

594
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,120
mess up together?

595
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,810
Look.

596
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,880
Look what you've done to Jiao'e.

597
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,120
Did we hit her?

598
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,780
I don't know.

599
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,230
What did you feed me?

600
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,300
50-year-old Jinhua Wine.

601
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
You should be grateful.

602
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,490
That wine is really precious.

603
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,850
My Lady,

604
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,600
the two of them

605
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,950
have been rotten apples

606
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,440
of this family.

607
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,630
Today,

608
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,290
they dared to drink
in the ancestral hall.

609
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,010
Tomorrow, they will dare

610
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,090
to poop here.

611
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,970
- No.
- No.

612
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,970
Are you insane?

613
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,490
Where do you think you are?

614
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,920
How could you say that?

615
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,820
Yeah.

616
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,840
Oh, My Lady.

617
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,400
My point is

618
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,820
we must

619
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,010
make them behave.

620
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,060
Or they will disappoint

621
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,810
the ancestors of this family.

622
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,090
You've got a point there.

623
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,090
Jiao'e.

624
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,600
From this day on,

625
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,400
make them learn some manners.

626
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,160
They'll be grounded until they finish.

627
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,020
Yes.

628
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,990
Grandmother,

629
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,930
I can learn manners.

630
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,970
But I can't be grounded.

631
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,730
Guiwei stays alone in the shop.

632
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,160
Don't worry about that.

633
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,090
Considering what you can do,

634
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,290
even if you work there,

635
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,160
you'll only be disgracing our brand.

636
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,500
Good point.

637
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,060
My Lady,

638
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,900
can I discipline them

639
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,980
the way I want?

640
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,820
Of course.

641
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,180
Old Lady,

642
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,660
one last question.

643
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,900
If the two of them

644
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,260
don't obey me...

645
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,420
If necessary,

646
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,460
you can use Qingming Stick!

647
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,100
Alright.

648
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,740
I'm relieved to hear that.

649
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,700
Junyi...

650
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,580
Did you hear that?

651
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,180
Old Lady asked me

652
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,780
to give you

653
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,140
a good lesson.

654
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,100
You deserve the pain.

655
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,180
My Lady.

656
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,660
Kneel properly.

657
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,500
I dare you to mess around again.

658
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,740
Get up.

659
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,180
This is my spot.

660
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,580
A few commodes are around.

661
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,700
I can't do it on any commode

662
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,580
except this one.

663
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,380
Then make do with it.

664
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,340
Do you know who I am?

665
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,620
Do you know what you just threw?

666
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,260
You didn't wipe.

667
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,780
I didn't poop.

668
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,460
What? Want a fight?

669
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,900
Pick up the letter.

670
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,420
You're both here.

671
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,060
What a coincidence.

672
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,660
This is an ambush, huh?

673
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,180
Pick up the letter.

674
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,300
Bring it on, all of you.

675
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Alright.

676
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,820
I...

677
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,020
Snatched my letter, huh?

678
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,180
How dare you?

679
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,500
Pick it up.

680
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,940
I said, pick it up.

681
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,060
You snatched my letter.

682
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,140
How dare you?

683
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,420
Pick it up.

684
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,820
Pick it up.

685
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,660
Bro, what's going on?

686
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,700
Mr. Long

687
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,560
went in there to deal

688
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,580
with a man named Kan.

689
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,980
Jing Kan?

690
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,620
Forge it.

691
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,700
It's none of my business.

692
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,260
Won't you go check on him?

693
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,380
I don't care.

694
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,620
How dare you snatch my letter?

695
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,380
Pick it up.

696
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,300
Bro,

697
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,340
Mr. Long

698
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,820
won't really kill him, huh?

699
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,300
That depends.

700
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,820
How dare you snatch it?

701
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,860
I hereby declare.

702
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,740
From this day on,

703
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,740
Mr. Jing will be

704
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,500
the third leader of Qinglong Gang.

705
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,780
Say hello.

706
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
Hello, Mr. Jing.

707
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,820
Mr. Jing.

708
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,940
Move aside.

709
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,470
Come on, guys.

710
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,350
Mr. Jing.

711
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,580
Make way.

712
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,380
Get out of the way.

713
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:08,470
Mr. Jing. Mr. Jing.

714
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,460
Mr. Jing. Mr. Jing.
