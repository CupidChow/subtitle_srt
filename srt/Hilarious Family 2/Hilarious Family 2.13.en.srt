the young ladies at will.

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,720
Why do I call them young ladies?

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,890

Has my mind been damaged?

36
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,300
Your 50-year Jinhua Wine is amazing.

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,580
It didn't give me a headache.

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,750
You'll never drink it again.

39
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,690

If I bury one now,

41
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,560
will I be able to drink it
50 years later?

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,170
I don't want to live that long.

43
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,730
You two,

44
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,990
gather here

45
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,990
at the Mao hour tomorrow.

46
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,930
Don't be late.

47
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,680
Understand?

48
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,560
Is she talking to us?

49
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,930
She has the Qingming Stick.

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,780
How long do you want to live?

51
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,890
I haven't thought about that.

52
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,720
You really don't take me seriously.

53
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,360
Tomorrow...

54
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,400
Tomorrow, I'll let you know

55
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,930
who I am.

56
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,730
Come, Jing.

57
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,490
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

58
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,890
- Good.
- Delightful.

59
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,930
No matter what,

60
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,010
Jing has joined us.

61
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,790
We have a new fierce warrior.

62
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,750
- Yes.
- Right?

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,450
To Jing.

64
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,450
To Mr. Jing.

65
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,570
Can you lower your voices?

66
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,090
What's wrong?

67
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,380
Kid, say that again.

68
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,420
Sir, sir.

69
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,690
Take this wine to drink.

70
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,420
- Don't look at him.
- So high and mighty.

71
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,520
You know better.

72
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,790
It's nothing.

73
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,090
Don't be angry.

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,610
It's fine.

75
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,520
This kid is quite bold.

76
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,770
This is what it means to be ruthless.

77
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,290
Jing,

78
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,260
you're definitely a tough man.

79
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,650
Do you have something

80
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,910
on your mind?

81
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,850
My brother means

82
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,940
that if you have

83
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,940
some trouble,

84
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,350
you can tell us.

85
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,260
We're here for you.

86
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,200
Yes.

87
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,920
My wife wants to divorce me.

88
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,810
A few days ago, she sent me a letter,

89
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,520
asking if I want a divorce.

90
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,930
That's not right.

91
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,000
Mr. Long,

92
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,720
can we receive letters here?

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,610
Right.

94
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,010
We can't receive letters here.

95
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,110
Why are you doing this to me?

96
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,150
No, I told you

97
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,260
that I wrote that letter.

98
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,200
You didn't believe me.

99
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,910
You imitated Sixi to write to me,

100
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,600
and it's even an acrostic poem.

101
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,140
You must be up to something.

102
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,030
No, I told you...

103
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,970
Everyone.

104
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,450
Jing's enemies

105
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,130
are our enemies.

106
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,280
Today, I'll show you

107
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,960
how far

108
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,600
this man's guts go.

109
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,120
Forget it.

110
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,810
We were at least friends once,

111
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,090
but from now on,

112
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,120
we aren't.

113
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,150
Mr. Long.

114
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,090
I heard

115
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,690
Jing owed you 100 taels.

116
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,060
No.

117
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,090
You owed him 100 taels,

118
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,380
and you repaid him
with some tricks, right?

119
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,320
No.

120
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,690
He did it voluntarily.

121
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,520
He did it voluntarily?

122
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,150
Then here's an IOU

123
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,960
saying you owe him 200 taels.

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,130
Sign it voluntarily.

125
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,410
You...

126
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,680
This...

127
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,720
What if I don't want
to sign it voluntarily?

128
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,060
Then we'll just force you

129
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,520
to sign it voluntarily.

130
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,730
I'll sign it.

131
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,820
I...

132
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,960
I don't even have a pen.

133
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,050
Got it.

134
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,050
Good.

135
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,160
This counts

136
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,720
as a small compensation for Jing.

137
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't let me see you again,

138
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,920
or I'll hit you once

139
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,160
and see you once.

140
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,360
Mr. Long,

141
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,840
are you saying

142
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,280
you'd hit him twice?

143
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,490
Yeah, pretty much.

144
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,840
Why haven't they come?

145
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,980
(Embroidery)

146
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll surely deal with you.

147
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,240
You were supposed to gather
at the Mao hour,

148
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,210
but you two were sleeping.

149
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,350
When did you tell us

150
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,530
to gather at the Mao hour?

151
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,970
Shuangxi, she did say that.

152
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,990
Drink less in the future.

153
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,200
Your memory is getting worse.

154
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,650
But

155
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,380
you didn't say the exact time.

156
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,620
Exactly. Maid, why are you so rigid?

157
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,540
Who do you call a maid?

158
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,430
I'm Ming'e.

159
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,370
Ming'e?

160
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,720
Jiao'e.

161
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,950
If I'm not mistaken,

162
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,600
Ming is the name for maids, right?

163
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,800
You...

164
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,340
Today, if this

165
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,460
falls on us,

166
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,020
I will repay you a hundredfold.

167
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
I dare you to try it.

168
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,540
The Old Lady asked me to discipline you.

169
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,500
What?

170
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,850
Do you want to resist?

171
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,780
I said it. You can try.

172
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,820
I'll try then.

173
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,740
What?

174
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,740
I'm trying.

175
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,900
I...

176
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,860
I just tried.

177
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,460
What? Will you hit me?

178
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,020
You're very bold.

179
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,140
I admire you.

180
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,460
You told me to try.

181
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
Help me!

182
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,380
Shut up.

183
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,020
Don't bring my niece here.

184
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,700
Quiet.

185
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,620
What are you doing?

186
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,500
I said

187
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,260
you can use the Qingming Stick.

188
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,100
I thought

189
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,900
I could control them,

190
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,620
but I didn't expect...

191
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,460
Mingzhen.

192
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,980
I entrust the Qingming Stick

193
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,300
to you personally.

194
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,180
Let's see who dares to disobey.

195
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,420
Junyi,

196
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,260
you really should replace a maid.

197
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,660
She's always hated us

198
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,960
and will definitely take revenge.

199
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,180
If you hadn't drunk
in the ancestral hall,

200
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,420
why would she hate you?

201
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,060
If you didn't cause trouble,

202
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,180
what excuse would she have for revenge?

203
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,220
- Exactly.
- Listen.

204
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,540
If you keep misbehaving,

205
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,300
go back to where you came from.

206
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,900
There's no place for you here.

207
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,860
If you

208
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
keep acting like this,

209
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,540
I'll take back the shop

210
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,780
and let Zhusi manage it.

211
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,660
Don't, Grandmother.

212
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,820
We'll be good.

213
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,740
Stand properly.

214
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Take good care

215
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,060
of the Qingming Stick.

216
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,180
No mistakes are allowed.

217
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,540
Don't worry, My Lady.

218
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,780
This time, I won't be careless again.

219
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,700
Hey, man.

220
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,700
Hey.

221
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,540
You must save me this time.

222
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,540
If this continues, I won't survive.

223
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,900
What's wrong?

224
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,260
They won't let me eat.

225
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,180
They won't let me sleep in bed.

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,340
Most importantly,

227
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,900
they even wrote on the privy's door

228
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
that "Ruan Ling's not allowed in".

229
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,100
Who's doodling?

230
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,900
Don't interrupt me.

231
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,620
Do you remember

232
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
I gave you money?

233
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,060
You have to protect me.

234
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,500
But you messed with the wrong people.

235
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,780
That money

236
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,140
won't protect you.

237
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,540
You're joking, right?

238
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,100
Smart of you.

239
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,980
I have some questions.

240
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,060
Answer honestly.

241
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,900
Is Jing Kan

242
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,540
the eldest grandson of Jinyu Tea?

243
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,300
But he's not favored by the family.

244
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,660
That's fine.

245
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,080
Don't kick someone
when they're down again.

246
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,300
I've heard about your letter.

247
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
Disgusting.

248
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,140
An acrostic poem?

249
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,100
I warn you.

250
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,900
Don't go after Jing Kan again.

251
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,100
I need him.

252
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,020
I...

253
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,620
♪You promised to take good care of me♪

254
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,540
♪But I felt sorry♪

255
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,780
♪To keep you worried♪

256
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,820
♪Brother, wish you good luck♪

257
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,780
Brother....

258
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,500
Must it be done this way?

259
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,500
Busy?

260
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,900
Nice beard.

261
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,020
I'm here for Jing Kan.

262
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,660
No, I'm here for Mr. Jing.

263
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,420
You can't just see him so easily.

264
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,620
Go away.

265
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,740
No.

266
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,040
There are some misunderstandings

267
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,340
between us.

268
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,420
I'm here just to explain.

269
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,660
Jing Kan.

270
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
Jing Kan!

271
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,980
Jing Kan.

272
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,540
Let him in.

273
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,220
Doing exercise, huh?

274
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,380
Jing Kan.

275
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,740
What's the matter?

276
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,660
Jing Kan,

277
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,660
we have some misunderstandings.

278
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,620
Given that I helped you before,

279
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,420
could you stop them

280
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,500
from making things hard for me?

281
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,700
Who's doing that?

282
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,380
Everyone.

283
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,260
Well.

284
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,380
This...

285
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,620
This is your own fault.

286
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,380
Who told you to do those things?

287
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,980
I...

288
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,100
Fine.

289
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
Anyway, you've scolded

290
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,740
and hit me.

291
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,460
Just forgive me.

292
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,700
I'll be honest.

293
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,940
Before, I never believed in karma.

294
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,580
Now, I'm starting to believe a little.

295
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,780
I admit.

296
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,900
I did want to use this chance

297
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,180
to erase the 100 taels

298
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,140
I owed you.

299
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,300
Yes, I wrote that letter.

300
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,220
My fault,

301
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,900
but I just wanted to settle the score.

302
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,900
As for the acrostic poem

303
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,740
and the word game,

304
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,260
that was pure coincidence.

305
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,140
You didn't notice?

306
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,640
I was very surprised at the time, too.

307
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,860
I didn't notice.

308
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,420
Then what do you want?

309
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,260
I...

310
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,140
I haven't had any staple food all day.

311
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,740
So, maybe I'm a bit agitated.

312
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,460
Everyone can understand that.

313
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,380
Right?

314
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,380
Jing Kan.

315
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,500
Fine.

316
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,620
I've said what I needed to say.

317
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,260
That's it.

318
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,860
I'm leaving.

319
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,580
Mr. Jing,

320
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,260
should we get someone to deal with him?

321
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,660
Forget it.

322
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,780
Give him some staple food.

323
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,180
Okay.

324
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,300
What are you doing?

325
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,060
Don't think I'm easy to bully.

326
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,020
Mr. Jing treats you to some staple food.

327
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,260
What does this mean?

328
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,820
Humiliating me like an animal?

329
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,460
- Eat.
- I won't!

330
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,660
Come on.

331
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,620
It's dirty.

332
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,420
Indeed, it's inedible.

333
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,140
It fell on the ground.

334
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,580
It's dirty.

335
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,860
What?

336
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,460
He won't eat?

337
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,340
He must still be sulking.

338
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Mr. Jing, what should we do?

339
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,620
He can't skip staple food.

340
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,960
What staple food did you bring?

341
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,740
Pastries.

342
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,980
Why not switch to rice?

343
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,760
He might not be used to pastries.

344
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,340
Sure.

345
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,380
What if he refuses rice?

346
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,940
Then,

347
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,620
you'll have to think of a way.

348
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,260
Sure, sure.

349
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,580
Is there any law left?

350
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,300
This is abuse...

351
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,140
Abuse of private...

352
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,620
Abuse of private punishment.

353
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,900
Mr. Jing said it.

354
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,420
He has to eat.

355
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,020
He's been fed eight bowls.

356
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,540
Shall we continue?

357
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,740
What else can we do?

358
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,660
Mr. Jing ordered it.

359
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,380
He might die from it.

360
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,580
You two continue.

361
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,660
I'll go ask Jing again.

362
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,980
What?

363
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,340
Eight bowls already?

364
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,820
He just doesn't like pastries.

365
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,980
Mr. Jing, should we continue?

366
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,580
If he can still eat,

367
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,500
you must make sure he's full.

368
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,580
Okay.

369
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,300
Mr. Jing said he must be full.

370
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,260
Continue.

371
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,020
Isn't Mr. Jing

372
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,780
a bit too harsh?

373
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,100
As the juniors,

374
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,340
we just execute orders.

375
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,660
Why all this extra talk?

376
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,260
Come on, man.

377
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
Hold on a bit longer.

378
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,660
Man,

379
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,500
can't I have some pickles?

380
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,660
Didn't you say you wanted staple food?

381
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,580
Are you a fool?

382
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,060
I'm done.

383
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,780
Keep feeding.

384
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,420
Mr. Jing.

385
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,900
Mr. Jing.

386
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,580
- Mr. Jing.
- Ruan Ling.

387
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,100
Untie him.

388
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,900
Ruan Ling.

389
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,180
Ruan Ling?

390
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,540
Stand up first. Come on.

391
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,900
Slowly, slowly.

392
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,620
Slowly.

393
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,660
- It's coming.
- What?

394
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,980
- It's coming.
- Coming?

395
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Ruan Ling, are you okay?

396
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,180
Move aside.

397
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,020
Stop pretending to be nice.

398
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,980
I won't forget what happened today.

399
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,580
Be careful.

400
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,100
Watch out for the threshold.

401
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,580
Delightful.

402
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,100
Jing,

403
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,340
our Qinglong Gang

404
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,420
can now be said to be

405
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,740
full of talent.

406
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,300
Look at this man.

407
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,260
He's Sky-climbing Rat,
the notorious thief

408
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,460
of Long'an County.

409
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,780
The man who's eating sugarcane...

410
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,300
Jin Buhuan.

411
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,840
I've heard

412
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,780
of Jin Buhuan.

413
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,540
Jin Buhuan took the fall for him.

414
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,500
That was huge.

415
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,860
Someone hired him

416
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,140
to poison Landlord Song.

417
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,020
In the end, Jin Buhuan got unlucky

418
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,260
and became the scapegoat.

419
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,980
- How unlucky.
- Unlucky.

420
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,200
What are you laughing at?

421
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,540
Laughing makes us look domineering.

422
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,140
Don't laugh like that anymore.

423
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,020
Okay.

424
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,500
I have some matters. I have to go.

425
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,180
Are you feeling better?

426
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,340
There were some misunderstandings.

427
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,580
If I tell you these misunderstandings

428
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,820
are all coincidences,

429
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,740
will you believe me?

430
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,940
Will you believe it?

431
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,900
I know that whatever I say now,

432
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,860
you won't listen.

433
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,180
But actually,

434
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,120
we both made some mistakes.

435
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,180
No.

436
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,220
It's all my fault.

437
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,500
You have no problem at all.

438
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,700
Come on.

439
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,180
From the time I entered until now,

440
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,540
I never said that, right?

441
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,500
Look at your attitude.

442
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,860
Look at your posture.

443
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,340
What attitude?

444
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,020
What posture?

445
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,180
I came here to apologize.

446
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,180
Is this an apology?

447
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,100
Yes. You're respected now.

448
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,020
It's different.

449
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,100
As for me,

450
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,500
I can't even go to the privy.

451
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,620
Who's stopping you?

452
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,140
I'm going to find them.

453
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,820
I don't want to see you.

454
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,500
Go away with your nobility.

455
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,620
Ruan Ling.

456
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,780
Don't call my name.

457
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,700
You...

458
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,100
The biggest regret

459
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,180
of my life

460
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,900
is that I lied to you.

461
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,580
You have to go so far, huh?

462
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,860
Go.

463
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,860
Go away!

464
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,900
Okay.

465
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,500
From now on...

466
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,740
What's their relationship exactly?

467
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,300
No idea.

468
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,660
Very subtle.

469
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,140
(Jing Residence)

470
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,780
(Balmy and Soothing)

471
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,180
Put that over there.

472
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,580
Hurry up.

473
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,960
Let me see your bracelet.

474
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,180
So beautiful.

475
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,420
Of course.

476
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,700
It was passed down

477
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,760
from my great-grandmother.

478
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,460
So precious?

479
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,460
A family heirloom.

480
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,420
Yes.

481
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,340
Why are you two just chatting here?

482
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,940
Go to work.

483
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,900
Grandmother

484
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,240
asked you to teach us rules,

485
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,500
not to teach us to work.

486
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,540
Rules mean work.

487
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,180
Work means rules.

488
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,380
If you don't know

489
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,520
how to work,

490
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,820
how can you know if the servants

491
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,580
have done their job properly?

492
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,960
You can tell if it's clean

493
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,180
at a glance, right?

494
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,390
- Exactly.
- Shut up.

495
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,780
Wash now.

496
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,460
Weren't you saying I'm a maid?

497
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,260
Let me see who's a maid now.

498
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,820
Jiao'e,

499
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
I have a question.

500
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,260
What is it?

501
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,860
If you train us as maids,

502
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,020
doesn't that make you

503
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,460
the head maid?

504
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,100
Yes.

505
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,060
You must treat us as ladies,

506
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,100
so you'll be

507
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,620
the head lady.

508
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,180
You two!

509
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,700
Do you think I'm a fool?

510
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,660
Listen.

511
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,060
I'm not that easy to fool.

512
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,220
Hurry up and wash.

513
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,980
When did these clothes

514
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,420
get together?

515
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,700
When you were rubbing them.

516
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,420
How should I dry them?

517
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,940
Don't worry. Just leave them here.

518
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,100
They'll dry by themselves.

519
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,500
Causing trouble?

520
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,620
No, I'm not.

521
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,940
That one's really tricky.

522
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,460
Yes, it won't untie.

523
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,300
Get up, get up.

524
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,980
You can't do anything.

525
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,260
No.

526
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,260
Hold it for me.

527
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,060
I'll just demonstrate once.

528
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
You need

529
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,660
to untie them slowly.

530
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,500
See?

531
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,060
It's done so easily.

532
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,620
Amazing.

533
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,900
When it comes to washing clothes,

534
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,860
the most important thing is rhythm.

535
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,900
Watch carefully.

536
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,660
One, two, one, two.

537
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,140
One, two, one.

538
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,740
She's good at this.

539
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,980
I never realized

540
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,700
you were so good.

541
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,300
Jiao'e,

542
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,260
I have another question.

543
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,340
How are you supposed

544
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,260
to remove

545
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,460
all these stains?

546
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,460
Pay attention and learn.

547
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,180
Just use plenty of soapberry powder.

548
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,580
Plenty of soapberry powder.

549
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,000
Anyway, they have plenty of it.

550
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,020
Use plenty.

551
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,500
Scrub first.

552
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,940
Then soak in water.

553
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,660
Amazing.

554
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,980
No wonder you're the head lady.

555
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,580
Head lady.

556
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,460
Whose clothes are these?

557
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,260
This seems to be a gift

558
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,620
from my nephew-in-law to my niece.

559
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,740
She really likes it.

560
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,660
What to do now?

561
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,900
I'll make another rule for you two.

562
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,420
Don't tell the Old Lady.

563
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,940
Okay, no problem.

564
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,380
Then what if...

565
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,220
What if I do this?

566
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,660
Grandmother, Grandmother.

567
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,660
Sixi,

568
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,420
I don't think we should make things
so hard for Jiao'e.

569
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,540
Yes, yes.

570
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,740
I think we should

571
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,060
find a skilled tailor

572
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,820
to help her repair it.

573
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Good idea.

574
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,100
Okay, okay.

575
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,980
I'll go out first.

576
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,180
You two wait here.

577
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,580
You'll go yourself?

578
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,400
Of course.

579
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,380
- Junyi!
- Grandmother!

580
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
- Junyi!
- Grandmother!

581
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,700
- Junyi!
- Grandmother!

582
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,820
Please don't.

583
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,940
Let's go together,

584
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,540
okay?

585
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,020
Let's go.

586
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:34,260
(Gratifying)

587
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,500
What do you think?

588
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,820
Can these clothes be mended?

589
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,620
I don't think they can.

590
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,060
You have to make another piece.

591
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,580
Do you have the fabric for it?

592
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,220
This is top-quality tussar silk

593
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
from the Western Regions.

594
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,140
I don't know if we have it.

595
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,260
I'll help you look.

596
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,460
Okay, okay.

597
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,980
Jiao'e.

598
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,420
We'll help you look over there.

599
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,500
Okay.

600
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,740
Let's go.

601
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,500
Don't wander too far.

602
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,060
Don't worry.

603
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,180
It's suffocating me.

604
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,620
Let's have a drink.

605
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,580
No, no. I won't drink.

606
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
I have to go to the shop.

607
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,460
Guiwei is alone there.

608
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,340
I don't feel at ease.

609
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,260
Come on.

610
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,300
Why go there?

611
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,260
He's already grown up.

612
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,740
Just two cups.

613
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,060
Two pots.

614
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,900
I think Jiao'e felt flustered.

615
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,660
Actually, she was quite panicked.

616
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,580
Do you know?

617
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,500
Sorry.

618
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,460
Are you okay?

619
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,900
It's you.

620
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,740
How unlucky.

621
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,260
Ma'am,

622
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,460
she already apologized.

623
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,660
Who are you talking about?

624
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,100
I was talking about her.

625
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,380
What's it to you?

626
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,100
No wonder you look familiar.

627
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,220
Aren't you the Tongs' housekeeper?

628
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,940
Stop pointing fingers here.

629
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,420
As expected of the Jings.

630
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,180
None of you has any manners.

631
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,740
Say that again.

632
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,340
You have no manners.

633
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,980
Fine.

634
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,140
I'll teach you some manners today.

635
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,260
Don't stoop to her level.

636
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,220
What now?

637
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,340
You want to beat me on the street?

638
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,980
There are four of us.

639
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,860
If you think that's not enough,

640
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,900
you can go call for more.

641
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,980
You...

642
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,900
Did I say anything just now?

643
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,020
This bowl

644
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,180
is a gift.

645
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,260
No need to thank me.

646
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,700
This bowl is a gift, too.

647
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,660
No need to thank me.

648
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,980
I charge for my mung bean soup.

649
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,180
You can't...

650
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,020
Fine.

651
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,620
Alright.

652
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,780
Tear their faces apart for me!

653
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,380
Don't waste words before a fight.

654
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,710
Beat her to death!

655
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,050
Beat me?

656
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,180
You don't know who I am.

657
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,820
I'll beat you to death.

658
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,260
Is this the material?

659
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,860
Yes, this is the material.

660
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,940
How long to make it?

661
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,500
At least ten days.

662
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,700
Is three days okay?

663
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,660
That requires extra pay.

664
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,140
Done.

665
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,780
But you must speed up.

666
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,740
No delays.

667
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,060
Okay.

668
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,180
Pay a deposit first.

669
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,060
It must be exactly the same.

670
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,380
No problem.

671
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,740
Exactly the same.

672
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,060
(Bojin Clothes)

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,580
What are you looking at?

674
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,660
Come over and help!

675
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,380
It's none of my business.

676
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,260
She's with them.

677
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,220
Don't let her run!

678
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,220
Don't come over!

679
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,780
Don't!

680
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,220
Even my mother never beat me like this.

681
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,060
I'll fight you!

682
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,860
Go away!

683
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,020
I'll beat you!

684
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,300
Come on, cheers.

685
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,220
Come on.

686
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,940
(Wine)

687
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,220
How can we explain this?

688
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,220
It's okay.

689
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,100
At least we won.

690
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,340
Yes.

691
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,500
You just need to be more precise.

692
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,540
Yes.

693
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,060
Still, thank you, Sixi,

694
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,300
for standing up for me.

695
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,620
And you, Jiao'e.

696
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,820
From today on,

697
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,860
we're friends.

698
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,820
Exactly.

699
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,280
- Cheers.
- Come on.

700
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,780
Now, let's think

701
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,220
about what to do with the stick.

702
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,420
How do we explain it to the Old Lady?

703
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,700
Tell her it broke by itself.

704
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,780
We'll vouch for you.

705
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,300
Who'd believe that?

706
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,460
Then tell her

707
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,540
(Wine)
a madman rushed over

708
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,660
and broke the Qingming Stick.

709
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,580
We can vouch for you.

710
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,100
But I took you two out.

711
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,180
How do we explain this?

712
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,700
Well.

713
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,100
How about this?

714
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,660
We'll find an excuse for the stick.

715
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,400
You'll find a reason for taking us out.

716
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,020
- Good to me.
- Let's separate.

717
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,370
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

718
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,900
The wine's good.

719
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,340
My god.

720
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,300
You're leaving me here?

721
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,460
Weren't we supposed to be friends?

722
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,940
Let's go together.

723
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,060
Come on.

724
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,300
Sure.

725
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,780
Help me think.

726
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,260
At that time, a madman

727
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,620
suddenly rushed out.

728
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,020
Somehow, he just grabbed
the Qingming Stick,

729
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,380
not anything else,

730
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,340
and broke it.

731
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,780
Then, he ran off.

732
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,940
Yes, yes.

733
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,940
We can testify.

734
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,740
The madman broke it and ran.

735
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,540
What color

736
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,860
were the madman's clothes?

737
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,940
Cyan.

738
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,980
How old?

739
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,860
Over forty.

740
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,820
How many of them?

741
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,780
Just one.

742
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,700
He ran off.

743
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,500
Jiao'e,

744
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,660
why did you take them out?

745
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,740
Shouldn't you have thought of that?

746
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,740
You didn't come up with it?

747
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,620
I...

748
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,540
Why?

749
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,020
When the madman left,

750
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,140
he hit me on the head.

751
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,060
Then, I couldn't think of the reason

752
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,380
why I took them out.

753
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,500
You couldn't think of it?

754
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,780
I couldn't remember.

755
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,020
You still couldn't remember?

756
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,540
The Tongs have come to scold us,

757
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,180
saying we have three madwomen

758
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,340
who tore their faces up.

759
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,500
That was you, right?

760
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,420
Jiao'e,

761
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,180
I asked you to discipline them.

762
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,300
But you colluded with them

763
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
and became the third rotten apple.

764
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,300
Zhenzhu would make the fourth.

765
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,580
Mother.

766
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,140
Oh, my god.

767
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,100
Tell me what's wrong.

768
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,820
Oh, you're busy.

769
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,060
Well.

770
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,540
A woman came to the door.

771
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,940
The Tongs came again?

772
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,340
What do they want?

773
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,700
No, no.

774
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,260
Not the Tongs.

775
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,580
She's here...

776
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,220
for Sixi.

777
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,140
She's here for you.

778
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,620
For me?

779
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,180
I'll fight them again.

780
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,780
Sixi.

781
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,240
(Mai Youyou, Ai Sixi's mother)
I finally found you.

782
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,420
Mother?
