Sir, come in, please.

00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,370
Presentable, indeed.

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,560
Today, don't fight Xiaoyu again.

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,020
I had a hard time calming her down.

30
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,450
Don't worry. We won't fight.

31
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,770
This is nice, too.

32
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,280
I have some good news.

33
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,950
How could you have good news?

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,460
Tell me. What's the good news?

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,400
Sit down.

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,240
I've got us some extra money.

37
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,330
Two hundred taels.

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,730
Two hundred?

39
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,800
You can always count on me, huh?

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,000
The two of you make a plan

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,610
for how you'll use the money.

42
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,240
Then you give me ten percent each.

43
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,170
The account will be clear.

44
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,930
No.

45
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,730
No?

46
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,280
Are you not clear yet?

47
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,120
200 taels.

48
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,090
Are you not clear yet?

49
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,520
I said, no.

50
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,550
If we give you more shares,

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,890
we'll be working for you.

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,800
Now, you should

53
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,110
think about this shop,

54
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,070
right?

55
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,170
With the extra money,

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,120
we can do a lot more things,

57
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,520
hire a lot more helpers,

58
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,450
and make more pastries.

59
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,270
Just twenty percent.

60
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,860
Be more far-sighted.

61
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,960
You should be far-sighted.

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,860
Yeah.

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,450
How about you give us twenty percent?

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,650
Lin Donglin,

65
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,950
are you also being ungrateful?

66
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,610
Let me confirm one thing.

67
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,680
My family doesn't know, huh?

68
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,860
No.

69
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,090
Then how did you get the money?

70
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,700
None of your business.

71
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,020
I know

72
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,960
many rich young guys.

73
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,680
Impressive.

74
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,960
Anyway, I will not

75
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,050
give you my share.

76
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
And you?

77
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,170
I'm on Xiaoyu's side.

78
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,400
Sometimes, too much money

79
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,120
will cause trouble.

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,120
What?

81
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,170
You two...

82
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,700
(Careful Pastry)

83
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,890
You rejected extra money.

84
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,960
You won't prosper!

85
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,740
I told you,

86
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,470
the new pastry wasn't good.

87
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,060
- Shh.
- Xiaoyu didn't listen.

88
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,030
Stop. Lower your voice.

89
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,970
Stop!

90
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,490
Dear.

91
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,800
What a coincidence.

92
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,800
Where have you been?

93
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,650
I was buying pastries for you.

94
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,960
The two of you together?

95
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,860
We met at the door.

96
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,800
Yes.

97
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,760
Nonsense!

98
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,260
I saw you come out

99
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,570
of Careful Pastry.

100
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,280
I didn't make it clear.

101
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,350
We met at the door

102
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,300
- of that shop.
- Yes.

103
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,380
So, we came back together.

104
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,320
That's right.

105
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,910
What were you there for?

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,160
- Pastries.
- Where are they?

107
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,720
I ate them in the shop.

108
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,890
You were pretty quick.

109
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,550
Fine.

110
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,330
Forget about the pastry thing.

111
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,210
So, tell me.

112
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,840
Yesterday morning,

113
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,300
why did you two go together

114
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,240
to buy some flour?

115
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,400
Flour...

116
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,090
Why did I buy flour?

117
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,210
I proposed to go.

118
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,360
Me.

119
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,570
It was me

120
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,010
who should go with Jiao'e.

121
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,600
But we couldn't carry it.

122
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,150
So, Mr. Lin offered to help us.

123
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,770
Yes. It was too heavy to be carried.

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,450
Who sent you?

125
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,730
Me.

126
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,850
It was me.

127
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,810
Yesterday, I wanted some pancakes.

128
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,160
There wasn't enough flour.

129
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,810
So, I sent Mingzhen to buy some.

130
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,970
Right, Mingzhen?

131
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,360
Yes.

132
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,560
Fine.

133
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,570
I'll say no more

134
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,250
about the flour thing.

135
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,280
But you're Ms. Luo's maid.

136
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,280
How dare you send Grandmother's maid?

137
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,090
What's wrong with that?

138
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,990
I don't even mind.

139
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,330
Why do you bother?

140
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,930
No more questions.

141
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,090
Dismissed.

142
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,410
Grandmother!

143
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,250
Dear, it's just a misunderstanding.

144
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,710
- It is?
- I'll put

145
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,770
the pastries back.

146
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,860
Go ahead.

147
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,890
I'll go back to work.

148
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,740
Look at the mess.

149
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,680
Stop!

150
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,480
Even if it all makes sense,

151
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,090
then why

152
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,130
have you always been unseen?

153
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,910
You've also been gone

154
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,330
at the same time.

155
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,600
Why do you often come and go together?

156
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,680
Confess!

157
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,300
What's your relationship

158
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,920
with that pastry shop?

159
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,050
It's me.

160
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,520
I sent them there.

161
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,970
Mother?

162
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,790
Why?

163
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,210
Why did you send them?

164
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,500
Because I want Jiao'e

165
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,010
to buy some for your grandmother.

166
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,620
Thank you, Muyun,

167
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,600
for thinking about me.

168
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,010
Jiao'e can eat them in the shop.

169
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,120
Why?

170
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,800
It's...

171
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,880
Why do you...?

172
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,930
You...

173
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,570
Why do you all take his side?

174
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,820
No, no.

175
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,040
We don't want you to misunderstand.

176
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,260
Right. You're a great girl,

177
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,520
but you're just suspicious.

178
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,760
Don't laugh.

179
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm thinking too much?

180
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,810
Yes, you are.

181
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,730
You really are.

182
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,920
I knew about the shop thing.

183
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,330
And I helped you out.

184
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,360
Give me twenty percent.

185
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,720
Come on.

186
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,460
(Intoxicating Spring)

187
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,450
What did Ms. Xue say?

188
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,890
She asked me for twenty percent.

189
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,120
Another twenty percent.

190
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,360
Now I understand.

191
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,520
All my family members know it now.

192
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,570
Even the maids know it.

193
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,620
But I...

194
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,110
Because I borrowed money

195
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,050
from the maids.

196
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,310
What is your problem, Lyu Jiao'e?

197
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,690
Every day, I work diligently

198
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,590
and sneak all the time,

199
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,230
just to avoid them.

200
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,240
But you...

201
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,890
Think like this.

202
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,590
Just because they knew,

203
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,860
they kept your secret
from Zhenzhu, right?

204
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,380
Or it would have been revealed.

205
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,230
You silly man.

206
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,170
What secret?

207
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,290
Zhenzhu.

208
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,020
(Jinyu Tea)

209
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,680
Chief Luo,

210
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,590
why did you let Jing Kan take part

211
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,880
as Old Lady requested?

212
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,620
Each tea shop

213
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,450
can offer two kinds of tea
for the contest.

214
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,240
But giving him one quota

215
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,210
is still unfair to us.

216
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,000
Whether he takes part,

217
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,210
I will win the first prize

218
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,760
of the Tea Contest.

219
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,370
Mr. Lu.

220
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,800
Let's do this.

221
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,070
Stop what you're doing

222
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,020
right now.

223
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,960
Take some gifts

224
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,360
and go to Wuyi Mountain

225
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,330
to invite Mr. Huang over.

226
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,600
Mr. Huang?

227
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,190
You mean the disciple

228
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,760
of Monk Da Fang?

229
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,240
He'll help us to pan-fire the tea.

230
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,680
With him,

231
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,360
we'll have a half chance

232
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,570
to win this year's contest.

233
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,000
As for the other half...

234
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,650
Mr. Ren.

235
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,000
You go to the Capital.

236
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,620
Whatever it takes,

237
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,540
invite Tea Master over

238
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,960
to assist us in making the tea leaves

239
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,960
for the Tea Contest.

240
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,880
It's not easy to invite them.

241
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,140
Otherwise,

242
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,050
I wouldn't send you.

243
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,680
That's right.

244
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,480
If they can come,

245
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,640
we will be certain

246
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,810
to win the Tea Contest.

247
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,130
So,

248
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,810
you must invite them over

249
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,290
at whatever cost.

250
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,230
Chief Luo,

251
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,230
it's late.

252
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,170
You get some rest.

253
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,450
I'll take my leave

254
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,720
with the two of them.

255
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,650
This way, please.

256
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,050
I'm so tired.

257
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,960
Give this letter to Wan'er

258
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,240
and ask her to instruct Aji.

259
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,810
Tell her to persuade Aji to study hard.

260
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,140
Even given a chance,

261
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,090
he still has to be capable enough.

262
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,370
Madam,

263
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,110
if you want Young Master Aji

264
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,050
to go into business,

265
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,120
why don't you instruct him?

266
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,050
We...

267
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,010
Go on.

268
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,880
Do you expect more gossip?

269
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,530
Use your brain.

270
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,640
What is Auntie thinking of?

271
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,050
Why must I go into business?

272
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,260
Like I said,

273
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,640
I'm in no mood for this.

274
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,290
It's the family inheritance.

275
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,260
Young Master Aji,

276
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,290
you are the nephew

277
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,530
of Madam.

278
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,720
You must be interested in business.

279
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,900
You just haven't realized it yet.

280
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,240
Let me be frank with you.

281
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,120
- I won't do that.
- No, Young Master Aji.

282
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,470
Madam has a plan

283
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,210
for your future.

284
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,480
Just do what you're told.

285
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,960
She won't hurt you.

286
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,860
Will you just stop?

287
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,470
I mean what I say.

288
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,720
Don't push it.

289
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,840
Madam also said,

290
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,070
every time you come here,

291
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,450
you'll get ten taels.

292
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,960
Deal.

293
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,650
Give me the money.

294
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,430
You haven't seen Ms. Zhu yet.

295
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,540
It doesn't count.

296
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,070
So, I have to see her, right?

297
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,010
Of course.

298
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,290
Alright. Ms. Zhu.

299
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,140
- Keep your voice down.
- Ms. Zhu!

300
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,380
Don't disturb her business.

301
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,760
Ms. Zhu. Ms. Zhu.

302
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,120
See? She isn't in.

303
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,560
I should go.

304
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,480
Give me the money.

305
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,480
Not until you learn, according to Madam.

306
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,950
You're setting one trap after another.

307
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,050
So, this is Aji, huh?

308
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,420
(Zhu Wan'er, Owner of Fu's Restaurant)

309
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,770
Ms. Zhu.

310
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,050
Young Master Aji,

311
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,480
this is Ms. Zhu,

312
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,810
owner of this restaurant.

313
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,960
Say hello.

314
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,370
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

315
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,570
I'm Ms. Zhu.

316
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,540
He doesn't have a knack

317
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,720
for business yet.

318
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,600
Please be more patient with him.

319
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,290
Stop nagging, will you?

320
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,600
You have half an hour.

321
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,640
If you sell this pot of wine,

322
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,800
I'll instruct you.

323
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,960
I'll buy it.

324
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,000
You think you're smart?

325
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,600
In business, you need real skills

326
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,930
instead of petty tricks.

327
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,470
Stop using

328
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,690
such childish tricks.

329
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,930
He might be too young

330
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,170
to understand this.

331
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,810
I have things to do today.

332
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,410
You may leave now.

333
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,960
Don't go, Ms. Zhu.

334
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,530
Ms. Zhu.

335
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,010
Young Master Aji,

336
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,960
I think you just used

337
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,600
a very smart trick.

338
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,770
You don't tell me.

339
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,690
Wait for me. Umbrella.

340
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,930
Dear, have a pork knuckle.

341
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,450
No, thanks.

342
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,170
Shall I get you some soup?

343
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,330
No, Mother.

344
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,090
I don't really want that.

345
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,600
Dear,

346
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,530
are you really not mad

347
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,690
at the pastry shop thing?

348
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,360
Why do I have to be mad?

349
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,090
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

350
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,470
Yeah. I don't mean to lie, either.

351
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,760
It's fine.

352
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,350
Everybody else knew it.

353
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,230
I'm the only one

354
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,330
who wasn't aware.

355
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,690
I don't care. No big deal.

356
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,690
I knew it.

357
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,140
All of you

358
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,210
would discard me one day.

359
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,620
This day just came earlier

360
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,450
than I ever imagined.

361
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,700
Kid, don't think like that.

362
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,620
Yeah.

363
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,590
- We wouldn't discard you.
- Yeah.

364
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,020
You're the spine of our family.

365
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,880
That's right.

366
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,480
Drop the act, will you?

367
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,780
I always know

368
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,720
what you think of me.

369
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,240
In your eyes, actually.

370
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,720
I've always been inferior.

371
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,480
No, no, no.

372
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,640
That's not true.

373
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,190
You may still deny it,

374
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,930
but I will not.

375
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,930
Everyone is born alone

376
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,690
and will die alone.

377
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,410
So, I think

378
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,960
we'll just live our own lives.

379
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,410
Don't bother.

380
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,930
I'm not worth it.

381
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,240
Dear. Dear.

382
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,170
Oh, she's never been like this before.

383
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,330
It's... It's really abnormal.

384
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,710
She didn't even scold me.

385
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,990
Will she get upset

386
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,830
and hurt herself?

387
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,740
I'll go check on her.

388
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,780
Wait. You may make her angrier.

389
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,720
I'll go.

390
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,110
Mother, calm her down.

391
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,050
I will.

392
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,290
Oh, look.

393
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,760
You're wearing lipstick.

394
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,320
You look gorgeous.

395
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,110
Right. Makeup can make you happy.

396
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,050
I'm going out.

397
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,410
Where are you going?

398
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,760
To find a way out.

399
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,930
You have your own businesses.

400
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,480
Who can I rely on?

401
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,210
I have to rely on myself.

402
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,190
Come on.

403
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,210
Don't blame Donglin.

404
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,860
He had wanted to tell you.

405
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,660
But he didn't want you to despise

406
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,930
that small business.

407
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,350
But anyway,

408
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,310
I've verified it.

409
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,950
His pastry shop

410
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,350
has good business.

411
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,140
It'll only do

412
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,360
our family good.

413
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,060
Mother, have you ever noticed?

414
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,150
Every time you start

415
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,870
to make an empty promise,

416
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,680
you'll keep saying "our family".

417
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,400
You think I can't see through you?

418
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,400
When have I made empty promises?

419
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,890
Zhenzhu,

420
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,060
you're the only one

421
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,580
in this world

422
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,050
that I can rely on.

423
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,540
I certainly have plans for you.

424
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,050
We're a family, after all.

425
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,010
Family?

426
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,580
Family is what has hurt me most

427
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,680
in my life.

428
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,840
Sometimes, I wish I had no family.

429
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,430
Because this word

430
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,490
is actually a burden to me.

431
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,250
And I understand.

432
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,870
I'm also your burden.

433
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,780
No, no.

434
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,840
Don't think like that, kid.

435
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,600
I'll skip Grandfather.

436
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,160
He despised me when he was alive.

437
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,200
And Grandmother.

438
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,010
She always thinks

439
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,530
her grandson is better than I am.

440
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,290
Family?

441
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,120
I've seen through it.

442
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,120
Are you done talking?

443
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,530
If you don't mind,
I'll go make a living.

444
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,850
Zhenzhu.

445
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,020
You...

446
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,970
You want a shop, right?

447
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,810
Fine.

448
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,810
You'll have Wushen Temple Shop.

449
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,290
I'll make you the manager.

450
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,150
You said we all had a business, right?

451
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,710
I'll give you this shop,

452
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,670
so you won't say this

453
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,600
to break my heart.

454
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,330
Are you really willing?

455
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,530
I have to, anyway.

456
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,290
Zhenzhu, listen to me.

457
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,780
Sometimes, you may not understand

458
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,050
what I'm doing.

459
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,430
But I swear to you.

460
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,500
I sincerely want you

461
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,050
to live the best life.

462
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,330
In this world,

463
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,290
if I didn't care about you,

464
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,810
who else would I care about?

465
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,740
Fine.

466
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,810
Then now,

467
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,430
you go to the shop

468
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,880
and announce this seriously.

469
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,890
Come on.

470
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,490
Zhenzhu, what have I done to you?

471
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,250
Why do you not trust me at all?

472
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,300
(Jinyu Tea Plantation)

473
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,920
I have something to announce.

474
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,260
From this day on,

475
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,120
Zhenzhu will be

476
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,050
the chief manager of this shop.

477
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,840
Are you clear?

478
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,770
Are you?

479
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,810
Then say hello.

480
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,090
Hello, Ms. Jing.

481
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,250
Call her Chief.

482
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,810
Yes, Chief Jing.

483
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Let me say something.

484
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,160
Sorry to interrupt you.

485
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,840
There's another thing.

486
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,050
Mr. Jia has left, right?

487
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,230
Liu, Ma,

488
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,330
She, and Chu.

489
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,340
I'll make the four of you

490
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,570
managers of this shop.

491
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,200
Managers?

492
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,410
Managers.

493
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,960
Say it.

494
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,090
Four of us?

495
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,480
Yes.

496
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,260
I'm telling you,

497
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
the four of you must help Zhenzhu

498
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,770
to manage this shop.

499
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,440
Never can you slack off, understand?

500
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,300
Alright.

501
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,240
Wait, Mother.

502
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,090
I never said I needed assistance.

503
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,390
As a newcomer,

504
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,260
you aren't familiar.

505
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,880
You certainly need assistance.

506
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,200
No, no, no.

507
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,580
The moment you announced

508
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,990
that I became

509
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,400
the manager,

510
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,580
I should be in charge

511
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,950
of all personnel arrangements

512
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,390
in this shop.

513
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,230
You shouldn't interfere. Understand?

514
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,250
No, no, no.

515
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,870
I'm not interfering, all right?

516
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,010
You either give me this shop,

517
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,250
or even if you hesitate,

518
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,050
you don't need to do this.

519
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,120
It's not what you think.

520
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,920
What the heck.

521
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,160
Fine, fine.

522
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,760
I won't interfere.

523
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,590
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

524
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,680
You really won't?

525
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,880
Hope you'll keep your promise.

526
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,760
Go back to work.

527
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,440
I should say that!

528
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,720
Go ahead, then.

529
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,770
I don't want to say anything.

530
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,530
Go back to work.

531
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,330
This is ridiculous.

532
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,970
How are you doing the accounts?

533
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,490
Five taels are missing.

534
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,970
Why did you shout?

535
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,490
I'll just give it to you.

536
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,280
Stop playing.

537
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,440
I'm not playing.

538
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,520
I'm doing the accounts.

539
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,200
Accounts?

540
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,580
There are rules for the abacus.

541
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,530
How can you calculate

542
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,880
when you don't even know that?

543
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,340
Wan'er,

544
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,400
were you drunk last night?

545
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,330
I made you yam and wolfberry porridge.

546
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,680
It's on your table.

547
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,250
I don't mean to be opportunistic.

548
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,050
I'm just caring about you.

549
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,280
Luo Aji,

550
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,730
if you really want
to care about someone,

551
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,780
you should first get to know

552
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,530
what she actually wants.

553
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,600
Don't call me Luo Aji.

554
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,970
Just call me Aji.

555
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,360
I'm not kidding.

556
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,910
Then, can you stop

557
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,440
treating me like a kid?

558
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,930
I'm not treating you like a kid.

559
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,790
But look at what you've done.

560
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,990
I just can't take you

561
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,570
for an adult.

562
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,960
Go back and tell your auntie.

563
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,150
You don't need to come.

564
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,810
Yuanbao.

565
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,240
See him out.

566
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,610
Alright.

567
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,010
Wan...

568
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,040
Wan'er.

569
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,610
Aji.

570
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,850
Aji.

571
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,240
What's wrong with you?

572
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,520
What happened?

573
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,500
Nothing.

574
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,740
Then, why are you drinking alone?

575
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,680
Today,

576
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,970
I said something wrong, I guess.

577
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,730
What did you say?

578
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,440
I asked Wan'er

579
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,640
not to call me Luo Aji,

580
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,530
but Aji.

581
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,920
Then, she was mad.

582
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,400
For this?

583
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,400
I don't think

584
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,970
Wan'er gets mad that easily.

585
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,520
Oh, I see.

586
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,490
She wanted to teach you something.

587
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,950
So, she talked harshly.

588
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,970
Am I right?

589
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,100
Why am I immature

590
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,490
in doing anything?

591
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,720
Aji,

592
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,330
don't say that.

593
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,640
It's good for you

594
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,090
to have realized that.

595
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,050
It's been just a few days. Look.

596
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,570
You've changed a lot.

597
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,780
That's brilliant.

598
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,880
Really brilliant.

599
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,280
Auntie.

600
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,770
What do you think

601
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,160
I should do?

602
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,840
I don't think

603
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,060
you should care too much

604
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,250
about what Wan'er calls you.

605
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,540
Nor should you care

606
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,060
about how she treats you.

607
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,100
I...

608
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,920
The point is, you must know

609
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,440
why you go there.

610
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,840
This is very crucial.

611
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,090
Wait.

612
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,580
If you think

613
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,500
you haven't achieved what you want,

614
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,160
you should never give up.

615
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,570
Right?

616
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,000
What do you say?

617
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,480
Auntie,

618
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,300
I think I'm confident again

619
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,640
to face Wan'er.

620
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,330
That's right.

621
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,870
The point is, you should

622
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,010
honestly confront who you are.

623
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,060
Thank you, Auntie.

624
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,200
You look gorgeous today.

625
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,490
Aji needs me, at last.

626
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,200
Madam,

627
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,250
don't you see something wrong?

628
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,730
What is wrong?

629
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,600
He calls her Wan'er.

630
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,130
Wan'er...

631
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,490
What is wrong with that?

632
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,410
People call an official

633
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,400
in the most respectful way.

634
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,960
And people call a lady

635
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,400
in the sweetest way.

636
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,880
Understand?

637
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,840
What are you talking about?

638
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,810
Don't be so ignorant.

639
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,200
Wan'er

640
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,530
really has a knack.

641
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,370
I can't hold on.

642
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,840
My hand would break.

643
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,200
My hand would even burn.

644
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,930
Oh no.

645
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,120
I'll go take a break.

646
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,170
Oh my goodness.

647
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,990
How does it feel?

648
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,930
Not too bad.

649
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,260
Why do I feel

650
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,330
so bad?

651
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,300
Get up! Fan the tea leaves!

652
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,240
Alright.

653
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,390
Do I have to keep fanning?

654
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,490
Yes, go on. Do it faster!

655
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,340
During the pan-firing,

656
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,910
someone must fan the tea leaves

657
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,920
to remove the heat.

658
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,640
Otherwise, the color, smell,
and flavor would diminish.

659
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,920
When fanned, the leaves will look green.

660
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,160
Otherwise, they will be yellowish.

661
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,570
It's not that easy

662
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,840
to make quality tea leaves.

663
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,650
Does it feel good?

664
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,440
Go watch over the fire.

665
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,040
Fixation.

666
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,200
Then...

667
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,000
Jing Kan.

668
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,540
Stop it. Go to sleep.

669
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,920
You've been doing it all night.

670
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,570
Stop it.

671
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,600
Your hand looks terrible now.

672
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,410
It's alright.

673
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,600
I feel better and better in my hand.

674
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,020
No. However well you feel now,

675
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,960
you need a break.

676
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,340
Master Tea-gold said

677
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,190
your tea leaves

678
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,670
were nearly as good as Banfang Tea.

679
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,610
You need a break now.

680
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,230
The aroma of our tea

681
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,090
is far worse than Banfang Tea.

682
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,150
But combined

683
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,880
with the poem Guiwei recited,

684
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,020
we're now clear about six steps

685
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,330
out of Seven Bowls of Tea.

686
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,990
Airing, fixation, twirling, spreading,

687
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,370
fanning, and roasting.

688
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,390
What on earth

689
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,440
is the last step?

690
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,050
Well, tomorrow, we'll go back
and ask Guiwei.

691
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,570
Alright, then.

692
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,630
It's been a long time

693
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,570
since we last went back.

694
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,190
I want to know

695
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,680
how's everything going in the shop.

696
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,250
Alright. We'll go back together.

697
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,870
Wanqing, what are you doing here?

698
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,090
Why are you up so late?

699
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,010
I'll go to sleep.

700
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,530
I'm here to sleep with Sixi.

701
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,340
Sleep with Sixi?

702
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,260
Come on, the two old guys
are fighting again.

703
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,440
I'm here for some peace.

704
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,920
Is this your pillow, Sixi?

705
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,250
What are they fighting for?

706
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,670
Tea-gold said this was his house

707
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,970
and would expel my grandfather.

708
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,430
You two go to bed, then.

709
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,370
I'm going out.

710
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,100
You two can sleep over there.

711
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,260
We can sleep vertically.

712
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,200
Don't be ridiculous.

713
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,840
He'll go on to practice.

714
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,120
Sixi, let's talk.

715
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,530
The two old guys

716
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,870
were sitting there...

717
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,290
I'm suddenly so sleepy.

718
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
You pressed on my hair.

719
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,760
I'm sorry.

720
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,410
Are you hot?

721
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,200
You're back.

722
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,540
How was your work?

723
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,480
There was progress.

724
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,650
What about the shop?

725
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,260
Sixi, Kan,

726
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,190
our shop will be finished.

727
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,600
Get up and tell us about it.

728
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,680
What happened?

729
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,970
I can't tell you now.

730
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,810
This shop looks good.

731
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,040
Who are you?

732
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,770
Let me introduce her.

733
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,430
This is An Wanqing,

734
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,740
Mr. An's granddaughter,

735
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,200
our great helper,
and Jing Kan's childhood sweetheart.

736
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,090
You're Mr. An's grandchild.

737
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,390
Actually, the three of us make a team.

738
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,360
We're Threesome.

739
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,990
She means, we can learn from each other.

740
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,020
That's not what I mean.

741
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,770
I mean, the three of us are awesome.

742
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,470
Yeah.

743
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,880
You're truly Mr. An's granddaughter.

744
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,920
I'm cold. I'll go put on more clothes.

745
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,640
You're the one who cheated them, right?

746
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,020
We never told her.

747
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,860
We never did.

748
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,950
They said you had a talent.

749
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,630
- Yes.
- We often said that.

750
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,500
But you're fussy.

751
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,630
We never said that.

752
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,570
Never.

753
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,050
I'll let you guys talk.

754
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,870
You...

755
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,990
Why? What's wrong with him?

756
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,930
Nothing.

757
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,100
Come on, Wanqing.

758
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,020
Sit wherever you want.

759
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,960
Oh, Guiwei.

760
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,780
We asked you to think of the last step

761
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,360
of Seven Bowls of Tea. How did it go?

762
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,540
Kan, I've been upset lately

763
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,820
and I can't recall that.

764
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,050
How about you give me a hint?

765
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,920
If we had a hint, we wouldn't ask you.

766
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,870
What's wrong with you? This is serious.

767
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,340
I really can't recall it, Sixi.

768
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,950
- Think hard.
- Don't force me.

769
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,290
Otherwise, I'd just recall less.

770
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,140
Think hard.

771
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,040
Alright, Sixi.

772
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,640
It's no use forcing him.

773
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,870
Give him some time.

774
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,810
Ruan Ling,

775
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,570
look what I've brought you.

776
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,850
There she is again.

777
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,910
What's wrong, Guiwei?

778
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,850
Come and sit down.

779
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,240
I won't.

780
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,370
Naughty boy.

781
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,230
Ruan Ling, you sit over there.

782
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,290
Why do you squeeze him?

783
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,240
I'll just sit here.

784
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,410
The point is

785
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,240
it's been a while.

786
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,440
I miss him so much.

787
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,960
- I...
- How about...?

788
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,240
You go first.

789
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I heard you were back.

790
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,090
See? I've brought you fancy wine.

791
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,880
The wine is for us?

792
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,200
But just now, you only called Ruan Ling.

793
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,330
Right.

794
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,600
But what I just said is...

795
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,430
"Ruan Ling, are they back?

796
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,740
I've brought fancy wine for them."

797
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,770
That's what I said.

798
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,950
- Yes.
- Yes?

799
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,680
She used to ask me like that.

800
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,990
When you were away,

801
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,500
she kept asking when you would be back.

802
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,710
- Yes.
- She often asked you?

803
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,650
Yeah.

804
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,570
You're a couple, right?

805
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,470
Wow.

806
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,760
How do you know that?

807
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,050
Come on. Tell me about it.

808
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,090
Let's drink. Come on.

809
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,810
Undercover couple.

810
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,440
What...

811
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,850
Are we even familiar?

812
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,570
You think you're a good judge of people?

813
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,120
Fine. Let me tell you this.

814
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,470
We're a couple now.

815
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,410
So what?

816
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,100
He's joking.

817
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,220
You just love joking.

818
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,770
Nice to meet you. A toast to you.

819
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,970
That's cool.

820
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,080
Yeah.

821
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Wanqing, drink slowly.

822
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,760
You drink really fast.

823
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,050
Who's she? She can hold her liquor.

824
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,120
I forgot to introduce her. She is...

825
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,890
What...

826
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,850
She's inferior to you.

827
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,660
Is she all right?

828
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,700
- Cheers.
- What?

829
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,200
Why are you asleep?

830
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,970
Tell me more.

831
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,470
Why are you so happy?

832
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,490
I am?

833
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,430
You can't help laughing.

834
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,640
Come on, Jing Kan. Cheers.

835
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,890
What on earth did you feed me?

836
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,620
I can't remember anything.

837
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,200
You drank with Great-grandaunt.

838
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,600
You drank like a fish.

839
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,210
Really?

840
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,790
But a moment later,

841
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,100
your head slammed on the table.

842
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,090
I carried you back.

843
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,100
Thank you, then.

844
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,430
I must be heavy. Thanks.

845
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,800
No, no. You're very light.

846
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,080
She's back to life?

847
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,500
Sixi, it's late.

848
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,350
Let's go back to bed.

849
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,290
You get some rest, too.

850
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,950
I... I just rested.

851
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,060
That wasn't a rest.

852
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,900
That was a coma.

853
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,830
Now, you need to rest.

854
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,670
Get some rest now.

855
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,520
Wait, Sixi.

856
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,580
Shall we have breakfast

857
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,620
tomorrow morning?

858
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,310
Not until you totally recover.

859
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,170
Let's go now.

860
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,390
Wait, Sixi.

861
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,720
Shall we talk for a while?

862
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,600
No. You really need to rest.

863
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,240
You drank too much.

864
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,470
Or you can talk to yourself.

865
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,750
- No, Sixi.
- Don't touch me.

866
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,060
We have things to do. Bye.

867
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,000
Eat the soup while it's hot.

868
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,750
Contact us after you wake up tomorrow.

869
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,750
Get to sleep.

870
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,690
Get more sleep.

871
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,050
Why does this scene

872
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,410
feel a little bit familiar?

873
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,100
Do you think An Wanqing knows

874
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,760
she has no sense of boundaries?

875
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,910
No, I assume.

876
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,600
Nobody would know that.

877
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,390
But he and Mr. An helped us a lot.

878
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,490
Don't embarrass her.

879
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,050
I won't do that.

880
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,140
Oh,

881
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,200
I have things to do tomorrow morning.

882
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,320
You eat with her.

883
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,560
No way.

884
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,790
So do I. You eat with her.

885
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,930
What do you have to do?

886
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,250
I'll sleep a bit more.

887
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,210
Ai Sixi,

888
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,080
I've been tolerating for a long time.

889
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,560
An Wanqing has no sense of boundaries.

890
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,420
You're still not mad,

891
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,450
and when will you be?

892
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,970
Why must I be mad?

893
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,180
Do you have feelings for her?

894
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,450
Not at all.

895
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,490
I just think you should share my burden.

896
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,580
She is your childhood sweetheart,

897
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,890
not mine.

898
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,990
This is your home.

899
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,530
Shouldn't you spend more time with her?

900
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,500
Fine. If you insist,

901
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,570
I'll do that tomorrow.

902
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,690
You...

903
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,970
That'd be really great.

904
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,120
Thank you for that.

905
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,750
Sixi,

906
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,690
let's talk this over.

907
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,620
I'll say that

908
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,560
another way.

909
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,320
What are they fighting over?

910
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,140
The girl

911
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,800
who moved in today.

912
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,810
Which girl?

913
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,450
Mr. An's granddaughter.

914
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,540
She's helping Jing Kan

915
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,800
with the Tea Contest.

916
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,810
Jing Kan.

917
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,600
He asked Mr. An for help.

918
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,700
He's really underestimating

919
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,450
this year's Tea Contest.

920
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,730
Yeah.

921
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,750
We have Tea Master

922
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,160
and Mr. Huang.

923
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,530
Mr. An won't worry us.

924
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,160
But Madam,

925
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,470
when the two of them

926
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,720
fought over that girl,

927
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,680
didn't it look like the scene

928
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,140
where you and Master

929
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,450
fought over Ms. Qin?

930
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,180
Talk nicely or just shut up.

931
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,540
Did I fight like that before?

932
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,760
You did, Madam.

933
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,950
When Ms. Qin first moved in,

934
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,680
you fought with Master every day.

935
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,830
Don't you remember?

936
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,240
I've been keeping you around me

937
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,200
just for the sake of our past.

938
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,850
I don't mean that.

939
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm just thinking.

940
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,100
Do you think

941
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,720
it's an opportunity for us?

942
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,990
What opportunity?

943
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,050
I'm thinking.

944
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,430
Shall we

945
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,140
recreate the old scene?

946
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,570
Are we enemies?

947
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,600
No, not on you.

948
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,080
Think about it.

949
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,060
Isn't Jing Kan just like his father?

950
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
Isn't that girl like Ms. Qin?

00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,490
Isn't Ai Sixi like you?

952
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,930
Not the appearance issue.

953
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,540
I'm not that stupid.

954
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,490
I can understand.

955
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,640
The Tea Contest will start soon.

956
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,180
If the two of them

957
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,010
are on bad terms with each other,

958
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,410
won't it be...?

959
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,060
A drastic...

960
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,700
A drastic measure.

961
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,580
Yes, that's it.

962
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,520
Alright.

963
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,970
Prepare a meal for me.

964
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,750
I'll give a big banquet

965
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,320
to Mr. An' granddaughter.

966
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,080
Yes.
