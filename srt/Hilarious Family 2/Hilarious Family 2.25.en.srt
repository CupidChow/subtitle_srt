Wei Shuangxi, open the door!

Coming, coming.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
What's up, friend?

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,840
Let me ask you.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,820
Did you tell them about me?

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
What do you mean?

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,360
I mean...

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,640
about me being a spy.

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
Maybe.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,360
Maybe?

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,640
You always

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,760
lie to me.

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,390
You were always upset,

39
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,100
so I wanted to help you.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
Besides, even if you left,

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
it'd still be a thorn

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,400
in your heart.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
Better to get it over with.

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
But you told me

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
you already told them.

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
So now,

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,880
there's no need to say it.

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
You...

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,160
I...

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,530
Friend.

51
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,000
Friend, friend.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
Calm down, calm down.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
Calm down.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,720
Come on, relax.

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,280
I've thought

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,280
of a way.

57
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,260
I think

58
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,160
we should have

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
an open and honest chat.

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,200
What should I tell them?

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm already like this.

62
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,670
Wei Shuang... Open the door.

63
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,240
Open the door! Wei Shuangxi!

64
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Why are you here?

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
Sixi,

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,240
I want...

67
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
You traitor!

68
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,190
- Guiwei.
- Fraud!

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
Guiwei.

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
I...

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Fine.

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,580
We're not friends anymore?

73
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,960
If so, then don't be my friend.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
Listen.

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,840
I used to feel a bit guilty,

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,800
but now I don't.

77
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,040
I don't feel anything at all.

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,200
Goodbye!

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,100
Who is it, shouting here?

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,400
Please bless them to lose,

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,560
so we can have a chance.

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,080
Or just give me a sign

83
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
to let me know your will.

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,080
Where is the main gate?

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Thank you.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Oh, it's him.

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,080
Sir, please wait.

(Vibrant and Splendid)

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
Have some tea.

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
I heard you know a lot about tea

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,000
and are also good at selling it.

92
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,560
I don't have the mood
to talk about this now.

94
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,200
I don't know what happened between you,

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,640
but I have

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,600
a good suggestion.

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,960
Would you like to hear it?

98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,360
What is it?

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
Would you

100
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,680
like to come to my shop?

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
This kind of thing

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,680
is not about suggestions

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
but about fate.

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,000
Who says we don't have fate?

105
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,920
What fate do we have?

106
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,240
Look.

107
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,280
Is it your shoe?

108
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,400
What a shame.

109
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,240
I hope

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,640
you can keep this secret.

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,960
Please come in.

114
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
Chief Xue, you're here.

115
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
Mr. Chen,

116
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
let me introduce you.

117
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,120
This is Mr. Ruan.

118
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Mr. Ruan, please have a seat.

119
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,960
Pour some tea, Mr. Chen.

120
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,970
- Have a seat.
- Sure.

121
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
Mr. Ruan,

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,040
I've heard a lot

123
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,200
about your skills.

124
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
To be honest,

125
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
you are exactly

126
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
the kind of talent we need right now.

127
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,160
Mr. Chen,

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
starting today,

129
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,680
Mr. Ruan will officially join us.

130
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
But I haven't agreed yet.

131
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,400
What are you hesitating about?

132
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,260
Haven't we already discussed

133
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,200
the terms?

134
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,800
Chief Xue, Chief Xue.

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,790
Li and his group are back.

136
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,040
Why are you shouting like that?

137
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
It's embarrassing.

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,520
What's the matter?

139
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,320
Li and his group

140
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,520
found a Gold-Silver tea tree

141
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,460
at a tea farmer's house

142
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
near Bailong Mountain.

143
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,180
A Gold-Silver tea tree?

144
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
You know that?

145
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,800
I've heard of it.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
It's said that this tea tree

147
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
is half golden yellow and half white.

148
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,620
It's a truly rare plant.

149
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,360
Half golden yellow and half white?

150
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
That sounds pretty good.

151
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,720
How much do they want?

152
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
A hundred taels.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
A hundred taels?

154
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,360
Are they crazy?

155
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
It's like robbery.

156
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
Where is this family's house?

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,240
Chief Xue.

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,500
I think we should wait and have Li

159
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,960
and his group report to you.

160
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,840
If it's not convenient,

161
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,870
I'll take my leave.

162
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,860
Please.

163
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,640
Sit down.

164
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
What's inconvenient?

165
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,980
You're one of us now.

166
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,960
Mr. Chen,

167
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,640
what about the recruitment?

168
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,880
There were a few good ones,

169
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,260
but they didn't want to come.

170
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,400
Why not?

171
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,380
Our shop

172
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,960
finishes work an hour later than others.

173
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
My goodness.

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,520
Just an hour later,

175
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,660
and they didn't want to come?

176
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,120
What are young people like these days?

177
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,520
They can't take any hardship at all.

178
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,880
I think it's understandable.

179
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
If you earn the same money,

180
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,040
who wants to work more?

181
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,540
Did you try to persuade them?

182
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,680
How could I persuade them?

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
We do finish work later.

184
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,720
Actually, that's not the point.

185
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
There are many benefits

186
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,580
to finishing work later.

187
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,760
I'd like to hear more.

188
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
Here's the thing.

189
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,680
Let me be honest.

190
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Working an hour more

191
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,160
means gaining an hour of experience,

192
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
right? It's a kind of blessing.

193
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,400
Moreover,

194
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,280
they learn skills for an hour more,

195
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,280
and our shop doesn't charge them for it.

196
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,680
Yet they still complain.

197
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,640
The most important thing is

198
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,840
that someone is paying them for it.

199
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,790
Where else can you find
such a good deal?

200
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
Nowhere.

201
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,720
Furthermore,

202
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,080
finishing an hour later

203
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,440
can help avoid the rush hour.

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Believe it or not,

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,000
they arrive home at the same time

206
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,160
as those who finish work earlier.

207
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,600
Was the last time you got beaten

208
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,160
because you spoke like this?

209
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,840
How could you say that?

210
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,200
He's made a good point.

211
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,240
Mr. Chen,

212
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,160
I didn't realize

213
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,280
until Mr. Ruan came

214
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,240
that there are still many areas

215
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,280
where you need to improve.

216
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,980
- I...
- It's not quite true.

217
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
Actually, I think

218
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,220
the manager should help
the Chief with worries,

219
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
or what's the use of this position?

220
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,400
Right?

221
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,600
Chief Xue.

222
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,480
Alright.

223
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Come on.

224
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,240
Good tea.

225
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,080
Really good.

226
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,400
Take it easy.

227
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,520
Chief Xue,

228
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,480
I have something to tell you.

229
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,400
Is it convenient?

230
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,160
Yes, it is.

231
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's talk somewhere else.

232
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,180
Got it. No problem.

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
You two keep talking.

234
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,220
I'll wait for you over there.

235
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,520
Chief Xue.

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Chief Xue.

237
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Chief Xue.

238
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,480
Let's talk somewhere else.

239
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,600
Right here is fine.

240
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,160
I'm just worried he might hear us.

241
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,560
I won't.

242
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,600
He...

243
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,440
Look at how adorable he is.

244
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,840
He used to be

245
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
the manager of Anping Bridge Shop.

246
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,840
But he suddenly came to our shop.

247
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Don't you find that strange?

248
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,160
What's so strange about it?

249
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
What if he's a spy

250
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,640
sent by Anping Bridge Shop?

251
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,000
What should we do?

252
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Chen,

253
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,020
let's first forget

254
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,960
about all the incapable

255
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
you've found.

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,880
We're in need of workers now.

257
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,720
Can't you be more open-minded?

258
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,720
A person's vision

259
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,240
is often reflected

260
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,480
in what they choose

261
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,120
when they encounter

262
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280
someone stronger.

263
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,640
It's about their attitude

264
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,120
toward people who are better

265
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,040
than themselves.

266
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,140
What do you mean, Chief Xue?

267
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,120
Are you saying I'm jealous of him?

268
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm not. Let me be honest with you.

269
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
Alright, alright.

270
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,640
Let me be honest with you, too.

271
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Do you know why

272
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
I trust him so much?

273
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Why?

274
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,120
Because he was sent by the Bodhisattva.

275
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,280
Sent?

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,840
That day,

277
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,680
right after I finished offering incense

278
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
to the Bodhisattva,

279
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,520
he suddenly appeared right before me.

280
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,800
I thought this must be

281
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,760
a sign from the heavens.

282
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,600
Okay, okay.

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Since you've brought up

284
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,040
the Bodhisattva,

285
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,200
what else can I say?

286
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,360
Alright.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
You can rest easy.

288
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,200
I know what I'm doing.

289
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
You

290
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,400
keep being the manager,

291
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
and he'll be your subordinate.

292
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,040
No, no.

293
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,200
That's not what I meant,

294
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
Chief Xue.

295
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,800
Come on now.

296
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,760
Let me tell you.

297
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
He will definitely

298
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,440
bring good fortune

299
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
to our shop.

300
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,840
Thank you, thank you.

301
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,560
I will definitely cherish this.

302
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,000
Who's there?

303
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,760
Mr. Ruan.

304
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,680
Chief Xue, can we talk now?

305
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
What's the matter?

306
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,160
I have a few things

307
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
I'd like to ask you.

308
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,680
Please, have a seat.

309
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,040
Sit, sit.

310
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
What brings you here

311
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,560
so late at night?

312
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Well.

313
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
While I was taking inventory
of the shop just now,

314
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,720
I noticed that our tea canisters

315
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,440
are different from those in other shops.

316
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,740
Some are inlaid with gold,
some with jade,

317
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,700
and some have patterns.

318
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,400
Why did you go to so much trouble

319
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
with the tea canisters?

320
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,480
It was just

321
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,920
a random idea.

322
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,000
When I went to buy wine,

323
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
I found a wine jar

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,300
that was particularly beautiful.

325
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,480
After drinking the wine,

326
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,000
you could even put flowers in it.

327
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,320
I really liked it.

328
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
So, I thought

329
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,280
maybe there are people like me

330
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
who'd buy tea

331
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,120
just for the canister.

332
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,840
That's why I changed our canisters

333
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,680
to what they are now.

334
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,240
What's the matter?

335
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,760
Is there something wrong?

336
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,240
I envy you for being able

337
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,520
to stay by Chief Xue's side.

338
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,160
Hearing your words is better

339
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
than reading ten years of books.

340
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,640
How so?

341
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,760
As the saying goes,

342
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,480
a good horse deserves a good saddle,

343
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,840
good wine deserves a good jar,

344
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
and good tea deserves a good canister.

345
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,080
In fact, a truly good product

346
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
should first leave

347
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,520
a good impression on others.

348
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,060
So many people rack their brains
over the secrets of business,

349
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,000
yet you've hit the nail
on the head so easily.

350
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
What a good idea.

351
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,040
You think so, too?

352
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,410
No, I've never thought that way before.

353
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,120
It was just hearing you say that

354
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,400
that everything suddenly

355
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,920
makes sense to me.

356
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
When I made the change,

357
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
everyone disagreed.

358
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
If only you had been here.

359
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,960
How could sparrows understand
the aspirations of a swan?

360
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
They know nothing.

361
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,480
Not everyone

362
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,160
has a vision.

363
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Ruan Ling...

364
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,080
May I call you that?

365
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,200
Of course.

366
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,520
I have

367
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,280
always felt

368
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,560
that there is

369
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,680
a special bond

370
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,920
between us.

371
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,760
It's really tiring

372
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,480
for a woman

373
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,600
to run such a big shop.

374
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,520
Yes.

375
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,100
That's why I'm here to help you.

376
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,720
And I have a feeling

377
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,900
that we'll be together for a long time.

378
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,720
So, there's something

379
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,360
I must confess to you.

380
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,200
What is it?

381
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,880
I am a spy for Luo Zhusi.

382
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,840
But don't worry.

383
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,080
I've completely cut ties

384
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,320
with both sides,

385
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,080
because I've met you,

386
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,400
my wise master.

387
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,440
I will entrust my future
entirely to you.

388
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,840
I will trust you unconditionally

389
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,560
and be willing

390
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,740
to lay down my life for you.

391
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,160
But I'm sure

392
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,480
someone will use this matter

393
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,120
to sow discord between us.

394
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,600
But I don't want

395
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,440
this matter to cause

396
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,040
any misunderstandings between us.

397
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,760
If one day,

398
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
you have any doubts about me,

399
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,280
please tell me directly.

400
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,360
I want to be

401
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,960
the first to know.

402
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
You trust me so much.

403
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,440
What else can I say?

404
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,560
Ruan...

405
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,120
Ruan Ling,

406
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,560
you mustn't feel

407
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,920
any burden, okay?

408
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,560
I promise you.

409
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,360
No matter what anyone

410
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
says about you,

411
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,280
I will always choose to trust you.

412
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,920
Thank you, Chief Xue.

413
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,180
You should get some rest.

414
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,880
I'll take my leave.

415
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,400
I have one last question.

416
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,440
Can I

417
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,000
come often to ask

418
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,760
for your advice in the future?

419
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,640
Of course.

420
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,000
Why are you still here?

421
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,350
- Leave.
- Yes.

422
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,460
(Jinyu Tea; Yihuchun Teahouse)

423
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
We agreed before.

424
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,760
Look, Madam Zhu.

425
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,120
You even came all the way here

426
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,300
to take care of my business.

427
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,880
Because

428
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
I trust you.

429
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
Walking a few steps is nothing.

430
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
Where's my tea?

431
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,400
Lin.

432
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,740
- Here.
- Coming.

433
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
Madam, your tea.

434
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,000
How nice.

435
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
If you get anything good in the future,

436
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,560
let me know right away.

437
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,720
Don't keep it to yourself.

438
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,600
I'll head back.

439
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,040
Don't forget, okay?

440
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,760
Ruan Ling,

441
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,160
you've brought all the old customers

442
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
from Anping Bridge Shop here.

443
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,720
What if Jing Kan hates you?

444
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,720
Plenty of people hate me.

445
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,740
One more won't make a difference.

446
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,120
Besides,

447
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,200
these customers

448
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
didn't come because of me.

449
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
Not you?

450
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
It's your good fortune

451
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,760
that attracted them here.

452
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,600
Oh, Ruan Ling.

453
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,560
Why did you take

454
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
such a long detour?

455
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,240
Why couldn't you

456
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,180
have come here sooner?

457
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,280
Yes, it's my fault.

458
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,400
I really deserve to die.

459
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,040
Good to know.

460
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
That's too much.

461
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,000
Mr. Chen, what's wrong?

462
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,440
Chief Xue, I have something important

463
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,600
I'd like to confirm with you.

464
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
Say it.

465
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,560
It's not convenient here.
Let's go upstairs.

466
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,480
Mr. Zheng is here, too.

467
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,200
What's there to be inconvenient about?

468
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,320
There are no outsiders here.

469
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,800
Since it's a meeting of managers,

470
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
I won't participate.

471
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,480
You should.

472
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,720
Is that okay?

473
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm not a manager.

474
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,960
I'm promoting you to deputy manager.

475
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,410
- Thank you.
- Wait.

476
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,120
Chief Xue,

477
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,720
let's have a meeting.

478
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,160
Chief Xue, please.

479
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Please.

480
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
Ruan Ling, you sit.

481
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,120
It's no trouble.

482
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,120
Serving you is my duty.

483
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,120
Chief Xue,

484
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,800
your brother brought back news

485
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,840
from the Patrol Division.

486
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,960
We need to decide early

487
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,520
on the tea

488
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,560
for the Tea Contest.

489
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,840
We're also participating
in the Tea Contest?

490
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,320
But there's only a maximum

491
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,880
of two spots per family, right?

492
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,480
We're not under the Jinyu Tea name.

493
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,240
I've opened another shop outside.

494
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,080
This is confidential.

495
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,560
No one can know about it.

496
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,920
How can you think of me that way?

497
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,960
I'm not targeting you.

498
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,040
In the family,

499
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,200
I may not compete on the surface,

500
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,360
but I won't just sit back
and do nothing.

501
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,840
Since no one thinks of me

502
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,120
for the Tea Contest,

503
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,800
then

504
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,400
I'll have to find another way

505
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,880
to prove that I can

506
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,400
do so much more.

507
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,160
How far-sighted of you.

508
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
What a long-term vision.

509
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,370
By the way,

510
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,280
what about the fresh tea leaves

511
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,400
from Bailong Mountain?

512
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,760
Beiju Master says

513
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
the fresh tea leaves there

514
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
are more suitable for steamed tea.

515
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,860
To participate in the Contest,

516
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,720
we need better tea leaves.

517
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,400
We have Beiju Master's help?

518
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,400
We just spent some money.

519
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,160
Goodness.

520
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,800
Chief Xue,

521
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,920
you've hidden so many great things.

522
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,360
You...

523
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,880
The Gold-Silver tea tree
at the foot of Bailong Mountain

524
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,560
is a good choice.

525
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,280
I heard that Laolongtan Tea

526
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,760
already knows about this.

527
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,360
If we wait any longer,

528
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
we might miss the opportunity.

529
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,400
Why don't we set off today?

530
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,720
Do you think 100 taels

531
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,000
of silver is too much?

532
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,840
Is it worth it?

533
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,280
- I think...
- It's worth it.

534
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,960
You think it's worth it?

535
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,760
However,

536
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,120
today is not a good day.

537
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,360
Tomorrow is a good day.

538
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,760
Before the Wu hour tomorrow,

539
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,480
let's go and buy it.

540
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,160
Alright, it's settled.

541
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,360
Decisive.

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,840
Guiwei.

543
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,060
Why are you here?

544
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,540
Where's Jing Kan? I want to see him.

545
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,000
You still have the nerve to see him?

546
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,160
You're not welcome. Leave.

547
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,350
- Guiwei.
- Leave.

548
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,520
How was it?

549
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,280
Not bad.

550
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,040
Come on.

551
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,960
Sit down.

552
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,200
What's going on?

553
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,720
Are you hiding something from me again?

554
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
I already know about it.

555
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,560
You had no choice.

556
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,820
You don't have to leave.

557
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,160
No, I have to go.

558
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,880
Why?

559
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,920
Do you still remember

560
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,960
what the doorman of Laolongtan Tea said

561
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,760
about them sending a spy
to the Jing Clan?

562
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,120
So?

563
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,680
Do you know why

564
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,000
the spy never returned?

565
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Alright, stop beating around the bush.

566
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,940
Because she stayed at the Jing Clan.

567
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,040
What?

568
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,400
Who?

569
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,800
I can't be sure yet,

570
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,120
but I've found

571
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,960
a suspicious person.

572
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Xue Muyun.

573
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,000
No way.

574
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,880
Auntie is not that complicated.

575
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
What if she's making you

576
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,720
think that way?

577
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,120
Do you know

578
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,980
what she did

579
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,260
before she married your uncle?

580
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,120
What?

581
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,160
She was an actress.

582
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,350
That doesn't mean

583
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,880
she's a spy.

584
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,560
But you should know

585
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,360
that the theater troupe she acted in

586
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,320
belongs to the Tan Clan.

587
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,360
I have a way.

588
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,640
Come.

589
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,680
So, even Great-grandaunt

590
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
knows about this?

591
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,100
Can you include me in the next meeting?

592
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,440
Why are you hiding

593
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,280
everything from me?

594
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,560
Guiwei, the fewer people

595
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,060
who know about this, the safer it is.

596
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,480
Fewer people?

597
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,240
Come on, I'm the only one in the dark.

598
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,520
Alright, stop interrupting.

599
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,200
It's hard for Ruan Ling to come back.

600
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,120
Hurry up and say it.

601
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,540
Alright, let me start
with two less important things.

602
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,440
First,

603
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,720
Xue Muyun secretly bought

604
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,560
a tea mountain.

605
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,440
A tea mountain?

606
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,420
Second,

607
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,150
Xue Muyun quietly took over a tea shop

608
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,220
and found Beiju Master

609
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,920
to secretly participate in the Contest.

610
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,000
What?

611
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,680
If this is not important,

612
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,480
what is the important thing?

613
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,640
They've recently

614
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,280
found a Gold-Silver tea tree.

615
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,520
They were supposed to go today,

616
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,440
but I stopped them.

617
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,480
So,

618
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,960
you must buy that tea tree

619
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,300
before the Wu hour tomorrow,

620
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,640
or we might lose

621
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,280
the Tea Contest.

622
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,760
Is this the place?

623
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,800
According to Ruan Ling,

624
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,640
it should be here.

625
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,320
Let me ask that man.

626
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,760
Sir.

627
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,840
Sir.

628
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,860
Who are you looking for?

629
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,520
Excuse us for the disturbance.

630
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,180
We came to see our Gold-Silver tea tree.

631
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,760
Gold-Silver tea tree?

632
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,920
You have it, right?

633
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
Yes, but you're too late.

634
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,680
Too late?

635
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes, Laolongtan Tea

636
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,580
has already been here.

637
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,760
They've been here?

638
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,900
It seems we were one step behind.

639
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
No, they were also too late.

640
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,200
Someone came even earlier?

641
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,440
No, that's not it.

642
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,960
The Gold-Silver tea tree

643
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,920
died.

644
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,200
Here.

645
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,280
This is the Gold-Silver tea tree.

646
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,440
It doesn't look

647
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,880
like a Gold-Silver tea tree at all.

648
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,360
Yes, it's been dead for a while.

649
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,840
Let's go.

650
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,320
We were not meant to have it.

651
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,000
Excuse us, sir.

652
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
- Take care.
- Thank you.

653
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,920
- Bye.
- Take care.

654
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,780
They have such a big business

655
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,920
and can send many people
to look for the tea tree.

656
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,280
We only have a few people.

657
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,360
Where can we find a new tea tree?

658
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,200
If only someone could

659
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,520
just bring one to us.

660
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,480
Bring it to us?

661
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,580
That's wishful thinking.

662
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
I've got an idea.

663
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,100
This is the Gold-Silver tea tree?

664
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,200
Yes.

665
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,560
Why does it look like firewood?

666
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,040
Because it's dead.

667
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,520
Then why bring it back?

668
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,000
Sixi didn't just brought it back.

669
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,920
She bought it.

670
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,080
Bought it?

671
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,400
How much did it cost?

672
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,200
Six taels?

673
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,560
Add a zero (ten).

674
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,200
Sixteen taels?

675
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,080
Sixty taels.

676
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,320
Get lost.

677
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,280
Sixi,

678
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
we've been making

679
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,640
some money lately,

680
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,360
but there's no need to squander it.

681
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,380
You just don't get it.

682
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,600
Let me tell you two.

683
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,880
Just leave this tree here.

684
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,240
No one is allowed to touch it.

685
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,840
Kan, you have to stop Sixi.

686
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,440
How can we put it here?

687
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,200
This dead tree affects the feng shui.

688
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,960
Do I look like I haven't tried
to stop her?

689
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,080
Sir, what's this?

690
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,800
This is

691
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,200
our shop's new item.

692
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,920
Firewood from the Gold-Silver tea tree.

693
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,560
Sixty taels. Would you like it?

694
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,800
How much?

695
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
Sixty taels.

696
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,840
Come here.

697
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,920
Are you crazy? Sixty taels?

698
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,320
Why don't you just rob people?

699
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,520
Kan, see?

700
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,080
This is the normal reaction.

701
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,480
Good, good.

702
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,880
Leave it here.

703
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,160
Chief Xue,

704
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,320
Ai Sixi has bought

705
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,160
that tea tree.

706
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,920
Isn't that enough to prove the point?

707
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,460
Ruan Ling is a spy.

708
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,340
He spied on Jing Kan,

709
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,400
and now he's spying on us.

710
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,320
He was just born

711
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
to be a spy.

712
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,180
Do you have any evidence?

713
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
What evidence do we need?

714
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,680
Only we knew about the tea tree.

715
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,800
Lin,

716
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,600
Mr. Zheng,

717
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
you and I

718
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,640
know about this.

719
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,640
Do you suspect me, too?

720
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,560
Chief Xue,

721
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,800
are you really biased

722
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,560
towards him to this extent?

723
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,160
Do you have a crush on him?

724
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,840
What?

725
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,120
That's nonsense.

726
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,040
Alright, I don't care

727
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
about your relationship.

728
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,520
I've done my best for you.

729
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,480
Here's my resignation.

730
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,320
Just nod your head,

731
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,680
and I'll leave.

732
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Fine.

733
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,320
Since you sincerely want me to stay,

734
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,400
I can stay.

735
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,680
But that spy Ruan

736
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,920
has to go.

737
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,040
That's not what I meant.

738
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,840
I just shook my head

739
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,080
to tell you

740
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,560
you're beyond help.

741
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
You're the one beyond help.

742
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,440
Look at him.

743
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,080
He has no vision or ambition.

744
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,440
Why would I keep him around?

745
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,580
Madam,

746
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,480
I think Mr. Chen

747
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,840
actually has a point.

748
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,680
What do you know?

749
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,120
Mingxia,

750
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,800
do you think

751
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
there's a big age gap

752
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,160
between Ruan Ling and me?

753
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,620
Madam,

754
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,120
you shouldn't say things like that.

755
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,040
When Ruan Ling came,

756
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,520
I saw through his little schemes.

757
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,040
He's after my shop.

758
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm after his true feelings.

759
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,080
It's a fair trade.

760
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,200
I want one of your shops, too.

761
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,600
Go away.

762
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,720
Clearly, you're not a fool.

763
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,440
Come on.

764
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,120
Come on.

765
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,560
Ouch.

766
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
What are you using on me?

767
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
I heard this can unblock the meridians.

768
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,160
I think you just want to laze in.

769
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,080
You just don't know good stuff.

770
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,360
Did you just say

771
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,760
Sixi spent 60 taels

772
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,120
on a tea tree?

773
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,760
These rich people

774
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,160
just have money to burn.

775
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,360
How could she be a lady?

776
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,560
If people hear about this,

777
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,200
they'll die of laughter.

778
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,740
And you won't burn your money?

779
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,720
At least I wouldn't

780
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,880
buy a dead tree.

781
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,280
How about

782
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,600
you give me 60 taels?

783
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,120
I won't.

784
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760
Give me 60 taels,

785
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,720
and I'll show you.

786
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,960
My Lady.

787
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,480
You really know how to joke.

788
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,540
60 taels?

789
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,660
I'll give you 60 taels.

790
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,360
Gently, gently.

791
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,760
Don't lose your touch

792
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,520
just because you're joking.

793
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,040
Alright.

794
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,400
By the way,

795
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,360
there's another thing.

796
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,640
I heard

797
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,880
that Sixi's manager

798
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,600
was poached

799
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
by Ms. Xue to her own shop.

800
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,880
What's the big deal?

801
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,640
People thrive when they move.

802
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,360
What's in my left pocket

803
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,840
goes into my right pocket.

804
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,760
Our family is thriving anyway.

805
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
Come on.

806
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,920
Chatting with you about gossip

807
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,760
is really no fun.

808
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,560
What's wrong?

809
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,720
It feels like it's working.

810
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,040
Just that acupoint.

811
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,080
Press a little harder.

812
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,440
See?

813
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,920
I told you this stuff works.

814
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,880
Wait a minute.

815
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,240
I'll give you something better.

816
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,120
It's even better.

817
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,040
Get ready.

818
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,440
I'll keep knocking.

819
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,600
It can unblock the meridians.

820
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,220
(Jinyu Tea)

821
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,180
(High price for tea trees)

822
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Sixi, incredible.

823
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,280
I finally know

824
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,520
where your 60 taels went.

825
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,700
What's the matter?

826
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,560
Let me tell you.

827
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,260
After you left last time,
a customer came.

828
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,560
Now, all the tea farmers know

829
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,480
that the dead tea tree
can be sold for 60 taels.

830
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,400
Think about it.

831
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,360
If it were a living rare tea tree,

832
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,440
how much would it sell for?

833
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,940
Everyone is now looking for tea trees,

834
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,360
trying to sell them to us.

835
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,440
The tea tree will just come to us.

836
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,960
Sixi, you're so smart.

837
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,900
I must find that customer

838
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,840
and ask him to join us.

839
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,140
He's done us a great favor.

840
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,180
Once we have the new tea tree,

841
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,320
you must study it carefully.

842
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,690
Don't make empty promises again.

843
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,760
Don't worry.

844
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,040
I'll keep a low profile.

845
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,900
You need to prepare the money.

846
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,240
If there's a good tree species,

847
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,480
we must seize the opportunity.

848
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,960
We can't let others get ahead of us.

849
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,520
Absolutely, it's all on me.

850
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,980
Come on, come on.

851
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,020
(High price for tea trees)

852
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,880
Thanks to you.

853
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,820
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

854
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,680
Good.

855
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,280
(Pure and Pretty; Vast and Clear)

856
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,400
Chief Xue, since Mr. Chen left,

857
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,020
our shop has sold

858
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,300
twelve canisters of Yunjiaojin,

859
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,880
ten canisters of Hengpo Tea,

860
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,720
and 13 canisters of Yuyechun.

861
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,060
The sales

862
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,060
are still considerable.

863
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,400
The customer repurchase rate

864
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
has increased by 30%.

865
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,760
All this is thanks

866
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,680
to our exquisite tea canisters.

867
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,560
The attendance rate of the helpers

868
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,600
has also reached an all-time high.

869
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,840
Moreover,

870
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,440
all the snakes, insects, and rodents
have been eliminated.

871
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,760
In short, the shop is thriving.

872
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,720
Chief Xue.

873
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,000
Chief Xue?

874
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,140
I've finished my report.

875
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,280
Ruan Ling,

876
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,040
what does your family do?

877
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
I grew up

878
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,640
with my grandmother.

879
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
She was a tea seller,

880
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,480
carrying a tin stove and tea bowls,

881
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,080
selling tea from a kettle in town.

882
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,720
That's how she raised me.

883
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,160
My goodness,

884
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,760
what a hard life.

885
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,200
Ruan Ling,

886
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,600
you should have lunch

887
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,640
here today.

888
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,760
It might not be appropriate for me

889
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,420
to eat with your family.

890
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,080
No.

891
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,560
It'll be just us here.

892
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
No.

893
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,980
There's a lot going on at our shop.

894
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,240
Our shop?

895
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,400
No, no.

896
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
It's your shop.

897
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,600
No, no.

898
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
It's our shop.

899
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,640
I really hope

900
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,440
you consider our shop as your home.

901
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,280
I know, I know.

902
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,320
Well, I...

903
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,240
I have to go back.

904
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,760
Ruan Ling.

905
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,640
What's the matter?

906
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,200
How old are you?

907
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,360
I...

908
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
What's your bazi?

909
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,600
What?

910
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,040
Bazi?

911
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,880
I need to ask.

912
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,320
I need to go back.

913
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,560
I have to ask...

914
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,800
Grandmother.

915
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,480
Grandmother?

916
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,960
Grandmother!

917
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,800
No way.

918
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Does she have feelings for me?

919
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,760
No way.

920
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,120
Absolutely impossible.

921
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,320
No way.

922
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,360
Impossible.
