Exactly.

27
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,770
The color

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,740

Why?

30
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,980
Hey, maid.

31
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,230
Have you ever tasted seafood stew?

32
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,830
You...

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,830
Since Sixi bothered to make the dish,

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,550
let's just taste it.

35
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,880
Go ahead.

36
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,110
You eat some.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,880
I made it for you.

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,200
I know.

39
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,360
But you eat some first.

40
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,850
You think I poisoned it?

41
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,790
Yes.

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
Others may not know you,

43
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,040
but I totally do.

44
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,480
If it's not poisonous,

45
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,130
you eat some first.

46
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,070
Yeah.

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,410
If it's not poisonous,

48
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,550
you eat some.

49
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,830
Wait.

50
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,270
Don't eat that much.

51
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,160
Ms. Wei,

52
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,710
shall we taste some too?

53
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,790
You didn't make this.

54
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,790
It's the seafood stew
from Zuixian Restaurant.

55
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,660
Deer sinews are only used

56
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,510
in the seafood stew

57
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,410
of Zuixian Restaurant.

58
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,150
And only the soup
from Zuixian Restaurant

59
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,470
can be this smooth.

60
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,080
Is that so?

61
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,800
But there's a strange taste.

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,240
So, this is the seafood stew.

63
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,760
It tastes really...

64
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,950
Jiao'e. Jiao'e.

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,160
Jiao'e.

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,270
No. 357.

67
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,880
Nice play.

68
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,200
I need to go back to my room.

69
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,620
(Jinyu Tea Plantation

70
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,270
What a lazy man.

71
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,040
Oh no.

72
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,140
Can't I have my bed

73
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,120
in this room?

74
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,760
What the...

75
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,030
Strange human, indeed.

76
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,790
Seriously?

77
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,750
It's leaking.

78
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,440
Guiwei. Guiwei.

79
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,080
Mr. Li?

80
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,640
Mr. Li!

81
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,750
It's leaking!

82
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,680
Let it be.

83
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,240
It'll be all right.

84
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,000

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,280
Li Guiwei!

86
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,470
It's leaking. Do something!

87
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,390
Are they of the same quality?

88
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,680
Yes. With the white fuzz on the surface.

89
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,560
What a man.

90
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,680
He can never stop sleeping.

91
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,730
Keep your voice down.

92
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,800
Can't you see we're talking?

93
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,760
Oh, it's leaking.

94
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,480
Umm...

95
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,110
- Serve them.
- No.

96
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,640
You go back to business. I...

97
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,030
What's the lowest price?

98
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,510
One tael and three qian.

99
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,350
Can I have a better deal?

100
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,550
To be honest,

101
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,660
this is the price

102
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,700
we give Ruicao Tea and Laolongtan Tea.

103
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,580
Right.

104
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,930
And we've never done business

105
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,240
with Jinyu Tea.

106
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,440
We don't know how much you can sell.

107
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,750
I...

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,040
Gentlemen,

109
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,710
we aren't amateurs.

110
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,930
And you shouldn't

111
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,470
fool a new businessman like this.

112
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,980
Manager,

113
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,220
they don't want to sell you tea.

114
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,610
Don't waste your breath on them.

115
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,990
- What...
- Don't you remember?

116
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,470
Back in Yan Village,

117
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,460
this was sold at one tael and one jin,

118
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,410
but I stopped you.

119
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,150
After all, we'll always need this tea.

120
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,950
A dozen jin for every month.

121
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,880
You need a reliable supplier.

122
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,350
You want some every month?

123
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,980
What if we can't sell it out?

124
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,150
It won't happen.

125
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,150
Last month, there wasn't enough.

126
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,540
Actually,

127
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,480
let me be honest.

128
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,460
We still have

129
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,200
a dozen jin of Baiyan.

130
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,290
I don't want him

131
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,320
to buy Yinzhen.

132
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,730
Since you aren't sincere,

133
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,900
seriously, let's not

134
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,270
waste each other's time.

135
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,490
As you can see,

136
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,370
we still need

137
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,470
to fix the roof.

138
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,930
Come on.

139
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,250
The tea in Yan Village

140
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,850
isn't as good as ours.

141
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah. It's inferior.

142
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,760
Anyway,

143
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,470
the purchasing price

144
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,470
can't be over one tael.

145
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,290
- Nice doing business.
- Yeah.

146
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,230
Nice doing business.

147
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,910
See you, gentlemen.

148
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm in his business way too much.

149
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,350
Ruan Ling, thank you so much.

150
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,610
That's all right.

151
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,900
Why did you totally believe them?

152
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,770
Such bad business.

153
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,850
Will you be satisfied

154
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,850
if you lose a lot?

155
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,990
The roof is leaking, huh?

156
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,870
Then go fix it.

157
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,320
I can't fix it.

158
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,580
I can.

159
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,460
I'll go check it.

160
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,710
Let me see what's going on.

161
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,200
It's all right. I won't be angry.

162
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,590
I'm really impressed.

163
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,530
Just enjoy your sleep.

164
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,800
Hope you won't drown later.

165
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,440
What a man.

166
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,920
Oh no.

167
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,610
Jing Kan!

168
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,750
Is it the wrong place?

169
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,130
Jing Kan!

170
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,400
What a silly man.

171
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,520
Stop yelling.

172
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,590
It's raining so hard.

173
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,350
He will be all right, huh?

174
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,980
Kan,

175
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,110
what are you doing so late?

176
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,440
Waiting for Ruan Ling.

177
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,470
Ruan Ling?

178
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,990
Oh, where is he?

179
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,230
Has he run away?

180
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,040
He is...

181
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,670
What was the noise?

182
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,710
What fell down there?

183
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,760
Did you fall?

184
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,470
Isn't it obvious?

185
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm warning you.

186
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't you dare escape.

187
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Now, you're awake.

188
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,400
Stop gibbering.

189
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,550
I was on the roof...

190
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,370
I see.

191
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,730
You tried to escape from the roof,

192
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,010
then you slipped and fell, right?

193
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,300
- Come on.
- You're so cunning.

194
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,240
Say no more.

195
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,870
Ruan Ling, you all right?

196
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,200
You must not

197
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,560
talk to me now.

198
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,940
Fine. I won't talk to you.

199
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,870
Kan, I've seen a lot of slackers

200
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,520
just like him.

201
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,160
- I'll give him a lesson.
- Shut up.

202
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,520
I'll hold it down.

203
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,370
I have to hold it down.

204
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,250
Have you succeeded?

205
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,750
It's coming up.

206
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,730
It's coming up.

207
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,670
What's coming up?

208
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,820
It's right here. I can't hold it.

209
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,760
What's wrong?

210
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,010
Kan. Kan.

211
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,430
- Stop running.
- What's going on?

212
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,990
I'll hit you.

213
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,830
What?

214
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,790
I'll hit you.

215
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,120
Mother,

216
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,650
this is the Saichunfang Tea

217
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,820
Mr. Cao has just developed.

218
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,760
Taste it.

219
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,590
Herbal tea?

220
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,830
So now, we not only

221
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,230
sell steamed tea,

222
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,080
but also herbal tea.

223
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,870
The types or methods of tea

224
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,400
don't really matter to me.

225
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,160
Any tea that can be sold

226
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,750
will be good tea.

227
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,640
Muyun,

228
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,250
would you like some

229
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,300
in your shops?

230
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,730
Oh no. No, thanks.

231
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,830
Thank you, Zhusi.

232
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,180
But I've heard

233
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,350
some steamed tea

234
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,940
failed in our tea plantation,

235
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,220
the taste of grass lingered,

236
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,520
and it was used to make herbal tea.

237
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,110
Who told you that?

238
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,350
Someone who knew what happened.

239
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,790
Grandmother.

240
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,920
There you are.

241
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,950
Good timing.

242
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,280
Go smarten yourselves up.

243
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,730
I've invited some clan relatives

244
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,950
for a family dinner.

245
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,460
I don't mean to complain,

246
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,280
but you can sleep
for a really long time.

247
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,470
Yeah, you slept for hours.

248
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,750
Why did I hear

249
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
Jiao'e was still asleep?

250
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,950
Were you guys poisoned?

251
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,400
I heard before they fell asleep,

252
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,830
they ate the seafood stew

253
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,950
Sixi made.

254
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,280
That's right.

255
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,830
Don't be kidding, Ms. Luo.

256
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,820
The seafood stew

257
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,950
could poison no one.

258
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,040
Right?

259
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,590
She's right.

260
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,530
What are you doing again?

261
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,470
I'm fooling you.

262
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,770
Then why did you sleep

263
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,080
for such a long time?

264
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,710
Because it was delicious.

265
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,340
At this point, I must praise

266
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,630
my great-grandniece-in-law.

267
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,520
The seafood stew she made

268
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,040
tasted brilliant.

269
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,160
Sixi, you can cook so well?

270
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,280
Perfect.

271
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,320
Make some dishes for dinner.

272
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,530
Good idea, Junyi.

273
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,680
I can't agree more.

274
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,560
Grandmother, to be honest,

275
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,200
I can't cook, actually.

276
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm not a cook, either.

277
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,420
How could you lie

278
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,360
just to reject the job?

279
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,420
Besides,

280
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,950
you'll make this family proud.

281
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,750
Why? You don't want to serve us?

282
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,710
You shut up.

283
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,580
Actually, you don't need

284
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,320
to be embarrassed about cooking.

285
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,670
Besides,

286
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,800
if you cook very well,

287
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,400
Jing Kan will feel proud.

288
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,370
As my daughter-in-law,

289
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,350
you don't serve me tea

290
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,470
or call me Mother.

291
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,100
Shouldn't you make some meals?

292
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,990
It makes sense.

293
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,190
It's so sweet of you.

294
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,590
Mother.

295
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,440
All right. Say no more.

296
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,470
The clan relatives will arrive soon.

297
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,160
Go get prepared.

298
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,200
I'll take my leave.

299
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,320
So will I.

300
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,470
Look at her.

301
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,280
Hey.

302
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,440
How will this benefit you?

303
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,640
It won't.

304
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,870
Then why?

305
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,160
Because it'll do you harm.

306
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,220
Your sadness amuses me

307
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,710
and your happiness upsets me.

308
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,520
Alright. Let's settle it once for all.

309
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,650
No way.

310
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,200
It will satisfy you, but not me.

311
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,320
Upsetting both of us, huh?

312
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,630
Yes, so what?

313
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,250
I'm making a fool of you

314
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,280
and torturing you.

315
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,710
But if you

316
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,830
kneel and kowtow to me eight times,

317
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,350
I may forgive you.

318
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,950
Why eight times?

319
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,060
I'm just excited.

320
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,670
Three would be little, so I said eight.

321
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,820
If you keep nagging,

322
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,800
I'll say eighteen.

323
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,670
Fine.

324
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,110
You give me no choice.

325
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,320
Threaten me?

326
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,180
This isn't Yuanyang House.

327
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,350
This is Jing Resident, No. 357.

328
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,950
No. 132, see you tonight.

329
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,300
I'll make you regret this.

330
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,240
Alright.

331
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,180
- Enjoy the food.
- Alright.

332
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,220
Here.

333
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,250
The last dish,

334
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,650
grilled beef.

335
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,590
All dishes are served.

336
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,800
Sixi,

337
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,470
you made all these dishes?

338
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,610
Yes, Grandmother.

339
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,680
I made them.

340
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,750
Oh my goodness.

341
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,870
Sixi, you can cook so well.

342
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,400
Oh, Auntie.

343
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,730
Come on.

344
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,200
Let's start to eat.

345
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,850
Impressive.

346
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,350
I underestimated you.

347
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,490
Who bought them for you?

348
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,710
Guiwei.

349
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,800
What if you give yourself away?

350
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,750
People here tasted the dishes

351
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,200
of all the restaurants in town.

352
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,470
I'm not worried.

353
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,250
I separated the dishes

354
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,870
and rearranged them.

355
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,710
Smart, indeed,

356
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,760
No. 132.

357
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,530
Don't panic.

358
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,470
You're No. 132.

359
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,080
I'm No. 357.

360
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,110
Why are the two of you

361
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,400
murmuring?

362
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,750
Nothing.

363
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,320
Enjoy the food, everybody.

364
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,370
Why does it taste

365
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,110
like the turtle stew
in Zuixian Restaurant?

366
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,350
Ma'am,

367
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,250
there aren't drumsticks

368
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,420
in that turtle stew.

369
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,530
Look, drumsticks here.

370
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,930
Why does the braised mushroom

371
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,200
taste like the one from Fu's Restaurant?

372
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,300
Mother,

373
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,680
there aren't glass noodles

374
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,440
in that dish.

375
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,590
Let me taste it.

376
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,240
Sixi,

377
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,160
you're impressive.

378
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,800
You flatter me.

379
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,590
Do you want to learn to cook?

380
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,800
You can cook next time.

381
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,520
I don't want to learn to cook.

382
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,040
However,

383
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,470
two friends of mine

384
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,590
can exchange experience with you.

385
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,230
Who?

386
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,100
This is

387
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,440
Chef Bai from Zuixian Restaurant.

388
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,130
And this is

389
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,350
Chef Jiang from Fu's Restaurant.

390
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,240
When did you get them here?

391
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,490
When Guiwei went to buy the dishes.

392
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,520
I just sent someone to follow him.

393
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,250
No. 132,

394
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,380
is it too late

395
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,350
if I apologize now?

396
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,600
Too late.

397
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,940
Gentlemen, I invited you over

398
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,010
to have a taste

399
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,220
of these dishes

400
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,460
and tell us how they taste,

401
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,400
compared to your dishes.

402
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,490
You flatter us.

403
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,430
Go ahead.

404
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,870
Alright.

405
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,730
My poor dishes

406
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,860
aren't good enough

407
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,800
to be compared.

408
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,190
That's right.

409
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,620
But you can't stop them

410
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,080
from eating something, huh?

411
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,250
Here. Try it.

412
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,320
Alright.

413
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,430
This is the turtle stew I made.

414
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,800
This is the roast chicken I made.

415
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,670
So much alike?

416
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,230
Young Madam,

417
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,620
did you buy these dishes

418
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,190
and rearrange them?

419
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,080
That's impossible.

420
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,110
Gentlemen, are you sure?

421
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,320
Definitely sure.

422
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,470
Look.

423
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,570
Only we roast the edge

424
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,350
of the turtle's shell.

425
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,670
Sixi,

426
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,630
what's going on here?

427
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,090
Be honest with me.

428
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,050
This time,

429
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,110
you can't fool anyone, huh?

430
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,080
Grandmother,

431
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,910
a toast to you.

432
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,380
Try to apologize?

433
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,460
You can't use the cup, then.

434
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,400
You need a jar.

435
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,000
Grandmother, I always want to say this.

436
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,570
From the bottom

437
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,490
of my heart,

438
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,240
I've been admiring you.

439
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,560
Great-grandaunt told me something.

440
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,250
When you were eight,

441
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,530
you collected all the good stones

442
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,180
one night before the stone skipping

443
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,640
just to win. Is that true?

444
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
No, Junyi.

445
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,010
I didn't say that.

446
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,860
Oh.

447
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,980
And when you were six,

448
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
you and the dog next door

449
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,750
competed in the tongue length. Really?

450
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,220
Oh, I remember.

451
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,910
When you were four,
you looked for ivory in a dog's mouth.

452
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,050
Is this all true?

453
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,910
You were adorable, Mother.

454
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,560
Wei Shuangxi!

455
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,010
Take it easy. Let me...

456
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,280
Let me explain.

457
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,320
First,

458
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,570
she isn't a cook.

459
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,830
She owned a gambling house.

460
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Grandmother, I explained this.

461
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,390
I'm not a cook.

462
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,980
And I didn't own a gambling house.

463
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,050
That was an inn.

464
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,730
- In...Inn?
- Yes.

465
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,600
But I gambled there.

466
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,940
Didn't you see the tablet there?

467
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,960
That was an inn.

468
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,990
You...

469
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,040
You're totally disgracing

470
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,590
our family.

471
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,040
You're two rotten apples.

472
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,590
Three, including Zhenzhu.

473
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,630
You'll have to kneel for three days.

474
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,010
- Yes.
- Yes.

475
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,480
If you slack off, you'll be kicked out.

476
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,030
Remember.

477
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,630
Keep your mouth shut.

478
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,560
Keep showing off. Don't stop.

479
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,670
Grandmother, she's standing up.

480
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,430
I was just stretching.

481
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,560
Making a fool of me?

482
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,050
Thanks to you,

483
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,890
now everybody knows

484
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,860
I was framed.

485
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,730
Thank you.

486
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,220
Be patient. There's a long way to go.

487
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,140
You wait and see.

488
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,490
- I'll wait.
- You just wait.

489
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,430
I will.

490
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,000
Grandmother, we'll stop talking.

491
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,190
Ai Sixi,

492
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,000
what did you feed me?

493
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm going to kill you!

494
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,510
Come on.

495
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,500
You can fight, but do it quietly.

496
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,420
You come over.

497
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,360
Hey, don't.

498
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,080
Ai Sixi!

499
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,800
Grandmother! Grandmother!

500
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,940
(Anping Bridge)

501
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,940
(Jinyu Tea Plantation)

502
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,880
Jing Kan,

503
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,720
you've purchased so much tea.

504
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,520
Can we really sell it out?

505
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,080
I think so.

506
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,030
You know what?

507
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,910
He always looks frivolous.

508
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,520
But he knows some stuff.

509
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,990
Don't say that.

510
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,730
You insisted on buying the tea.

511
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,460
I only helped you negotiate the price.

512
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm not accountable.

513
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,010
This isn't my work.

514
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,980
Don't be so modest.

515
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,480
Kan, don't worry.

516
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,670
I'll help you sell.

517
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,080
You?

518
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,800
Do you know anything about tea?

519
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,960
I...Almost.

520
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,190
Forget it.

521
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,280
Go wash the teacups.

522
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,240
Ruan Ling, wash the teacups.

523
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,190
Guiwei, you do that.

524
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,730
Ruan Ling and I

525
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,870
will talk about something.

526
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,320
Go ahead.

527
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,310
Anyway,

528
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,380
our shop

529
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,670
must be open soon.

530
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,140
The three-month bet

531
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,090
will be due.

532
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,030
What bet?

533
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,190
Speaking of this makes me angry.

534
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,380
He made a bet with Luo Zhusi

535
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,620
that if this shop failed,

536
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,560
it would be returned.

537
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,910
He's pretty much doomed.

538
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,640
Don't be scared.

539
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,320
We'll work hard together.

540
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,290
But anyway, I think Guiwei

541
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,230
has a point.

542
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,810
As long as we work hard together,

543
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,870
I believe our shop will be open.

544
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,390
What was the saying again?

545
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,080
"Burn the bridge."

546
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,590
I have a question.

547
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,560
You said you would open the shop.

548
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,810
Then tell me.

549
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,910
How will the shop be open?

550
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,480
Isn't it open now?

551
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,830
The door is open, isn't it?

552
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,730
Yeah. I...

553
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,670
We didn't talk about the details.

554
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,800
You were fooled, huh?

555
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,220
If you ask me,

556
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,320
you'd better return the shop now.

557
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,110
Or you'll run it for three months.

558
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,870
Sixi, do I still need to wash the cups?

559
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,710
Yeah, Jing Kan.

560
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,770
You didn't make a deal with her

561
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,700
or something.

562
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,770
Do you have to give her

563
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,860
all the money you make?

564
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,980
You should have asked.

565
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,350
I was busy shouting back then.

566
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,490
No need to ask.

567
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,590
Look, I have a plan.

568
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,560
Why don't we

569
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,110
just close the shop?

570
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,700
Oh.

571
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,810
Don't be hard on yourselves.

572
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,750
And don't be hard on me.

573
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Shall we break up

574
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
and go our separate ways?

575
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,840
No way.

576
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,670
In this case,

577
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,870
I'm going to ask her now.

578
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,480
Why bother?

579
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,040
Has Aji written back?

580
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,470
Not yet.

581
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,560
He's being inconsiderate.

582
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,480
He's been away for so long,

583
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,240
but has never written to you.

584
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,520
Maybe he's been busy.

585
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,320
(He's a grown man.)

586
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,900
(But he's so impolite.)

587
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,840
What's up?

588
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,630
Just get to the point.

589
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,280
Don't be mealy-mouthed.

590
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,910
I'll get to the point, then.

591
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,090
Last time, I said

592
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,720
I'd open the shop within three months.

593
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,600
- Umm...
- What's wrong?

594
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,880
Is it difficult?

595
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,250
Young Master, if you find it difficult,

596
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,760
just apologize to Madam.

597
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,380
She isn't mean, after all.

598
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,520
It's not difficult.

599
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,870
I just think we need a standard.

600
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,090
If I run the shop

601
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,140
too well,

602
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,090
you'll be upset.

603
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,030
You'll be ashamed, too.

604
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,640
When it's due,

605
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,390
if there are 300 taels in surplus,

606
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,190
you will win.

607
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,390
It's not too hard, huh?

608
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,510
300 taels?

609
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,190
300...

610
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,960
It doesn't sound too much.

611
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,000
Fine. I'll accept it.

612
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,160
It's a deal, then.

613
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,640
300, humph.

614
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,220
Jing Kan isn't very talented,

615
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,280
but he brags really a lot.

616
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,730
I had someone copy their accounts

617
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,670
from Ruan Ling.

618
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,430
This month,

619
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
they haven't even sold

620
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,630
ten packs of tea leaves.

621
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,720
He can keep talking tough.

622
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,960
But I don't think

623
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,110
he can last three months.

624
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,290
Recently, Mother

625
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,080
will go to Mount Liuhua for Buddhism.

626
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,000
Prepare more things for her

627
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,910
and make her stay there for more days.

628
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,990
Yes.

629
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,520
This time, I'll make him surrender.

630
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,290
Why isn't Kan back yet?

631
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,870
Luo Zhusi won't embarrass him, will she?

632
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,810
Don't use that cup.

633
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,800
It's Kan's cup.

634
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,270
Don't tell Ruan Ling.

635
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,180
Why can't you

636
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,280
buy yourself a cup?

637
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,350
Guess who broke my cup.

638
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,250
Ruan Ling?

639
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,240
Ask him to buy you one.

640
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,420
Kan did.

641
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,460
Well, then.

642
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,720
You should have kept it well.

643
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,230
I knew it.

644
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,050
- Where's Ruan Ling?
- He said

645
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,140
his pillow's not comfy.

646
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,080
He's out to buy one.

647
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,360
He's so fussy.

648
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,770
Ruan Ling will escape?

649
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,800
Why didn't you tell me?

650
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,980
Kan's pillow isn't good, either.

651
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,390
I could have asked him for help.

652
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,350
Something's wrong with you, Sixi.

653
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,600
Me?

654
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,050
What is wrong?

655
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,630
You don't worry that he may escape.

656
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,190
He could have escaped.

657
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,910
Then why did you stare?

658
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,900
And...

659
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,910
When you mention Jing Kan,

660
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,760
you keep calling him Kan.

661
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,800
Do you really take him for your husband?

662
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,730
No.

663
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,430
Are you sure? That's not true.

664
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,290
Anyway, he is my husband

665
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,520
in name.

666
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,870
I don't want to give us away.

667
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,670
We should playact even in daily life.

668
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,270
Don't want to give away?

669
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,140
But when you called him a coward,

670
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,190
you didn't care at all.

671
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,760
Did I ever sound that harsh?

672
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,670
Sixi.

673
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,990
Yu?

674
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,620
I didn't know

675
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,560
(Anping Bridge Shop)
you would settle down here.

676
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,590
By accident.

677
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,290
That year,

678
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,670
entrusted by Yue's mother,

679
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,040
I begged you to save her.

680
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,150
Unexpectedly, Landlord Song died.

681
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,490
When I think about it now,

682
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,670
I got you in great trouble.

683
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,030
I don't blame you.

684
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,480
It's just my destiny.

685
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,670
Now, I worry

686
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,700
that innocent guys will take the blame.

687
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,110
You aren't to blame, either.

688
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,460
Landlord Song

689
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,040
wasn't killed by you.

690
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,670
It's hard to explain.

691
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,180
You know what?

692
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,220
These days,

693
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,000
a lot more Jin Buhuans
have been arrested.

694
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
I know.

695
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,000
I thought this case was over.

696
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,380
Unexpectedly,

697
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,720
some of Landlord Song's servants

698
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,190
saw your figure.

699
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,570
Those who were caught

700
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,530
didn't look like you.

701
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,630
So, the arrest has begun again.

702
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,190
Before it's too late,

703
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,830
you must run away.

704
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,080
Run away?

705
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,430
The carriage is ready.

706
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,490
It's paid, too.

707
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,380
You go through the pass

708
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,320
and head to Suzhou.

709
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,280
But I...

710
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,000
When am I leaving?

711
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,960
At noon in three days. At the city gate.

712
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,670
In three days?

713
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,240
I haven't lived here for too long.

714
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,520
But in this case,

715
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,350
I don't want to leave.

716
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,630
Funny.

717
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,590
A pillow with patterns.

718
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,750
Come on.

719
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,590
Have something to drink.

720
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,240
I cooled it for you.

721
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,560
It's not hot anymore. Try it.

722
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,640
Alright.

723
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,920
How do you feel?

724
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,920
Any better?

725
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,960
I feel less stuffed.

726
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,700
Look at you.

727
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,640
You've stayed for long.

728
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,320
Why do you still stuff yourself?

729
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,050
Because all the dishes here

730
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,990
taste great.

731
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,110
What if I can't enjoy them later?

732
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,600
Don't be silly.

733
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,910
Why can't you enjoy them?

734
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,870
I mean...

735
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,630
When we're busy with the shop,

736
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,720
we can't eat at home too often.

737
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,250
If you're too busy,

738
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,250
I'll have some dishes

739
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,390
delivered to you.

740
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,600
Jing Kan,

741
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,240
it's so nice of you.

742
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,870
Have I done anything wrong today?

743
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,670
No.

744
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,080
What about you?

745
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,060
No, either.

746
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,590
Then why did you praise me?

747
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,390
Why can't I do that?

748
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,230
You just seldom do that.

749
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,460
That's not true.

750
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,040
I often praise you. I...

751
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,520
I called you gentleman.

752
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,730
When you tricked me

753
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,670
to paint for you.

754
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,840
Trick?

755
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,080
How could you say that?

756
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,290
Then why didn't you

757
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,320
complain about the wife?

758
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,490
Back in jail,

759
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,420
you begged me so hard

760
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,360
that I approved.

761
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,240
Who begged you?

762
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,560
Let's get this straight.

763
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,980
If you didn't hit that advisor,

764
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,920
I wouldn't be in jail.

765
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
I think you just...

766
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,520
I should beat you up.

767
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,910
Your favorite chicken butt
from Fu's Restaurant.

768
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,490
That's not my favorite.

769
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,560
How disgusting.

770
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,810
It tastes good, though.

771
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,240
It doesn't.

772
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,290
Don't hit my face.

773
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,330
You eat it yourself.

774
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,560
Disgusting.

775
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,290
If you like it, eat it.

776
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,290
- Stop it.
- You eat it.

777
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,460
- Who is it for?
- Try it.

778
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,040
I won't. You eat it.

779
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,630
Not this one. It's too soft.

780
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,320
This one is all right.

781
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,810
Here, Guiwei.

782
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,830
This is for you.

783
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,530
Sixi, isn't it enough?

784
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,900
Kan and I don't need this much.

785
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,910
It's far from enough.

786
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,470
Sixi.

787
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,730
Will you really leave

788
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,670
without telling Kan?

789
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,590
Why would I tell him?

790
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,730
He would cry

791
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,670
and upset me.

792
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,810
I think we should tell him.

793
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,080
What if he can solve the problem?

794
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,040
How can he solve it?

795
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,110
He's busy enough with the shop.

796
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,590
Let's not make trouble.

797
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,270
As for you,

798
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,430
help him as much as you can.

799
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,330
If he fails the bet,

800
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,830
the two of you will have to starve.

801
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,270
I know.

802
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,460
You'd better worry more

803
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,400
about yourself.

804
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,190
If it weren't for this emergency,

805
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,460
I'd definitely stay here

806
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,400
and help you guys.

807
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,080
Sixi, don't think like that.

808
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,980
If you could really help,

809
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,080
our shop wouldn't end up like this.

810
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,320
Guiwei,

811
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,670
this is really "comforting".

812
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,830
Sixi, don't flatter me now.

813
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,470
I...

814
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,590
Bill, please.

815
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,640
Alright.

816
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,180
Sometimes, I feel

817
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,960
I were in a sort of dream.

818
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,270
Now, I should wake up.

819
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,760
You loved each other, after all.

820
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,240
Don't be disgusting.

821
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,490
Sixi, I still think

822
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,770
you should tell Kan.

823
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,590
If you disappear, he'll look for you.

824
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,840
No need.

825
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,800
How about this?

826
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,560
You tell him I have family business.

827
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,770
I guess he'll forget me

828
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,720
in a month or two.

829
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,920
He won't.

830
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,760
I think he relies on you a lot.

831
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,290
If you really leave,

832
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,290
he'll be upset.

833
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,230
Stop.

834
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,830
Don't be so sentimental.

835
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,460
We're adults

836
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,830
who won't be upset.

837
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,910
I'll tell you something, Guiwei.

838
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,490
For a man,

839
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,760
his life matters most.

840
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,830
If he dies, nothing will bother.

841
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,140
In this world,

842
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,240
people meet and break up.

843
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,080
They won't stay together forever.

844
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,080
Don't talk like that.

845
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,450
If we're destined to meet,

846
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,750
we will meet again.

847
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,270
Sixi,

848
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,110
what if I miss you

849
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,080
when you're away?

850
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,950
Miss me?

851
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,090
When you miss me,

852
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,400
look up at the moon.

853
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,670
I'll also watch the moon and miss you.

854
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,310
What if it's cloudy?

855
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,040
It means I'm not missing you.

856
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,490
I hate cloudy days.

857
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,530
Come on.

858
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,610
I won't miss you every day.

859
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,570
Why won't you miss me

860
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,510
every day?

861
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,080
I need to rest, all right?

862
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,480
I don't want that.

863
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,330
In this case,

864
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,310
I'll go with you.

865
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,430
No. I'll be more exhausted.

866
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,590
I'll just stick to you.

867
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,860
Let me carry one.

868
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,400
No need. You could have helped earlier.

869
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,070
Jing Kan.

870
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,960
I bought you a pillow.

871
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,240
Try it.

872
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,440
Why did you suddenly buy me a pillow?

873
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,690
You told me

874
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,130
your old pillow isn't comfy.

875
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,360
So, I just bought one.

876
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,690
Give me your old pillow.

877
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,630
Bad implication.

878
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,430
Try this one.

879
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,150
How does it feel?

880
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,590
Great.

881
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,590
You have good taste, indeed.

882
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,740
But you bought only one.

883
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,840
Bad implication, too.

884
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,170
In a couple of days,

885
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,210
I'll go shopping with you

886
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,570
and we'll buy an identical one.

887
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,920
A pair will look good on the bed.

888
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,110
I won't share a bed with you.

889
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,430
What?

890
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,130
When I need to sleep,

891
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,310
I'll go get it.

892
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,030
Jing Kan.

893
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,000
I want to say something.

894
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,030
I don't think

895
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,980
you should live on

896
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,750
with those bad memories.

897
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,710
People should move on.

898
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,010
If your mother were alive now,

899
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,750
she wouldn't want you to live in hatred.

900
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,530
Since I stayed with you,

901
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,630
I've really changed a lot.

902
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,170
Before, hatred

903
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,110
used to be my crutch.

904
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,880
I was always spoiling

905
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,880
as if I would do something great.

906
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,340
Only in this way would I not realize

907
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,280
I was a loser.

908
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,670
Who said you were a loser?

909
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,980
You left your rich family

910
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,490
and lived alone out there.

911
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,890
You weren't a loser at all.

912
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,980
Since I met you,

913
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,190
I've finally understood.

914
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,840
In many cases,

915
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,310
the more we hide,
the more it will reveal.

916
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,440
I should live just like you.

917
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,960
Live an honest life.

918
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,460
If I care less,

919
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,480
I'll live a better life.

920
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,920
Honest?

921
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,040
An honest life.

922
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,310
I've been staying here

923
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,480
for quite a long time.

924
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,990
I think

925
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,710
Luo Zhusi is really annoying.

926
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,790
But your other family members

927
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,960
are very nice.

928
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,720
Very nice?

929
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,690
Not to mention

930
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,980
this super big family

931
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,110
in this big mansion.

932
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,670
Even in a normal family like mine,

933
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,850
family members

934
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,560
may argue, fight,

935
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,530
or get angry.

936
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,880
That's normal.

937
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,790
Don't think too much about that.

938
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,400
You're a family, after all.

939
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,530
Do you know how much it takes

940
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,230
to be a family?

941
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,750
Why do you suddenly bring this up?

942
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,550
Just chatting.

943
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,980
Shall I ask Chef Cai to make you

944
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,400
rice cake soup with red beans?

945
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,720
Alright.

946
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:40,960
It's so late at night.

947
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,520
Don't think when you're alone.

948
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,520
Wait. I'll be right back.
