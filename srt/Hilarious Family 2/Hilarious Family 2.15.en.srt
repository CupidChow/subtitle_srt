Sir,

26
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,620
a bowl of fried flour.

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,970
We don't have that.

28
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,030
One bowl of butterfly noodles.

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,410
We don't have that.

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,360
What do you have then?

31
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,970
Just plain noodles.

32
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,220
I'll have one bowl.

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,160
Alright.

34
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,080
There are two of us.

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,640
Two of us!

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,510
This is the IOU for 200 taels

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,850
that Long Er forced you to write.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,330
You...

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,770
I'm leaving.

40
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,300
Aren't you eating?

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,270
No.

42
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,210
Sixi is waiting for me.

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,680
The noodles are for you.

44
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,930
You're free now.

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,960
Your noodles.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,720

What's the difference

49
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,640
between fannings and scented tea?

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,840
Fannings,

51
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,450
as the name suggests,

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,450
come from fanning trees.

53
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,770
Scented tea

54
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,350
comes from scented trees.

55
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,330
Are you sure?

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,840
Trees are the source of tea.

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,740
Please.

58
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,330
Even I know both teas

59
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,960
come from the same tree

60
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,450
and are just processed differently.

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,670
You're running a tea shop, huh?

62
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,930
No, I'm joking.

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,800
How can you

64
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,960
test me like this?

65
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,890
The first bowl dries the throat.

66
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,960
The second bowl kills loneliness.

67
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,180
The third bowl...

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,740
The third bowl leads to deep feelings.

69
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,580
Only...

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,490
What are you doing?

71
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,070
What are you doing?

72
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,740
Can't you see I'm selling tea here?

73
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,830
I'm reciting a poem.

74
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,050
You just can't tell what's urgent.

75
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,120
Listen.

76
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,460
What did you do yesterday?

77
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,020
I went to Aunt.

78
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,500
She asked me to bring her some meds.

79
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,490
Meds?

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,470
Why does my mother need meds?

81
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,520
She said it's for beauty and skincare

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,040
to keep the skin tight.

83
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,320
Why?

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,130
The three-month bet

85
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,260
with Luo Zhusi is almost up.

86
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,710
Ruan Ling and Jing Kan are not here,

87
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,870
and neither of us knows tea.

88
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,180
What should we do with the shop?

89
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,120
Well...

90
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,670
Sixi, I noticed something.

91
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,000
Say it.

92
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,230
Since Kan went

93
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,480
to the Plantation,

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,810
your temper has gotten worse.

95
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,180
I...

96
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,330
My temper has gotten worse?

97
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,440
Really?

98
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,610
Well.

99
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,910
I have a bad temper?

100
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,470
Why is my temper bad

101
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,480
only with you?

102
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,250
Think about it yourself.

103
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,050
Think carefully!

104
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,820
Isn't it because I'm the only one here?

105
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,760
Only me.

106
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,850
Sixi.

107
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,530
Kan.

108
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,760
Kan.

109
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,600
Kan, you're back.

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,650
You're back.

111
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,530
Kan,

112
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,890
while you were gone,

113
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,010
I suffered.

114
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,920
Why did you come back early?

115
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,440
Because I behaved well.

116
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,720
You didn't escape back, did you?

117
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,530
Of course not.

118
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,360
We're at the shop.

119
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,710
After all this time,

120
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,360
our business is still like this.

121
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,860
Why are you the only one back?

122
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,800
Where's Ruan Ling?

123
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,960
We dragged him down.

124
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,820
He suffered enough at the Plantation,

125
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,760
so I let him go.

126
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,560
Kan,

127
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,080
Ruan Ling left,

128
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,040
so who can work for me?

129
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,210
Work yourself.

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,380
But

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,500
the bet with Luo Zhusi

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,990
is almost due.

133
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,710
You don't have anyone to help you.

134
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,740
Finding another Ruan Ling

135
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,680
will be tough.

136
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,050
If needed,

137
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,570
let Mr. An find someone.

138
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,610
Excuse me.

139
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,400
Are you hiring?

140
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,470
Ruan Ling, Ruan Ling!

141
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,040
I really suffered.

142
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,110
No need to say more. I understand.

143
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,050
You don't.

144
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,240
Let me ask you.

145
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,120
You treated me to noodles,
but why didn't you pay?

146
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,360
Didn't I?

147
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,910
Kan, since when

148
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,010
did you two get so close?

149
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,930
We shared hardships.

150
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,570
I'm not soft.

151
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,230
I just

152
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,480
can't bear seeing

153
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,160
the shop run like this.

154
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,560
Got it.

155
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,450
Now that you're back, I feel at ease.

156
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,930
Then let's agree.

157
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,260
I don't owe you money anymore,

158
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,550
but if you want me to stay,

159
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,280
you must agree to one condition.

160
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,850
What condition?

161
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,970
I want an extra bed.

162
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,480
I must sleep alone.

163
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,550
Also, I want a private privy.

164
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,770
Only I can use it.

165
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,110
So simple.

166
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,450
Just a bed.

167
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,040
Guiwei, go buy a bed.

168
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,150
The privy?

169
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,590
Guiwei, use the one outside.

170
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,770
Okay, it's settled.

171
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,320
Let's go.

172
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,560
Grandmother.

173
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,040
What's the good stuff?

174
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,010
You didn't eat this as a child.

175
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,670
I brought this from the Plantation.

176
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,010
The people there like to eat it.

177
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,600
Now, it's a delicacy?

178
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,740
Seems going through hardships

179
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,040
has its benefits.

180
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,680
Yes.

181
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,770
Let me tell you.

182
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,810
Business is like war.

183
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,760
If you're careless,

184
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,210
you'll suffer big setbacks.

185
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,000
Remember, cautiousness

186
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,210
is the key to last.

187
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,080
Grandmother, you used to say

188
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,500
I should experience more hardships.

189
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,440
I didn't understand.

190
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,010
But after going to the Plantation,

191
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,740
I realized

192
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,240
many things in this world

193
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,840
aren't as simple as I imagined.

194
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,530
I just heard

195
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,210
you want to participate
in the Tea Contest.

196
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,600
What do you think?

197
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,210
My mother made Banfang Tea

198
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,320
and helped the family
win the Tea Contest.

199
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,110
As her son,

200
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,480
I should inherit her work.

201
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,450
Also...

202
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,960
Also what?

203
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,250
Tell me.

204
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,230
Also, I don't want

205
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,210
the local tea farmers to keep suffering.

206
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,960
The Plantation of Taiping County

207
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,090
produces 1,600 jin of tea every year.

208
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,530
Why is that?

209
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,960
Because those corrupt officials

210
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,240
are using this to extort and profit.

211
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,950
In the end,

212
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,230
it's people like us who suffer.

213
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,860
The reputation of tribute tea

214
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,900
may be an honor

215
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,960
for Taiping County,

216
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,170
but for ordinary people like us,

217
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,840
it just means labor and waste.

218
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,770
The ones who suffer

219
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,960
are the common folk.

220
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,690
The tea farmers are suffering?

221
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,540
Anyway, I will definitely

222
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,840
participate in the Tea Contest.

223
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,330
It's good that you're ambitious.

224
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,600
What pleases me most

225
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,880
this time

226
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,330
is not what you learned

227
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,570
at the Plantation,

228
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,120
but that I see someone by your side

229
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,330
who never leaves you,

230
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,000
sharing both hardships and joys.

231
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,880
Jing Kan,

232
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,530
in life,

233
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,640
a good companion is rare.

234
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,950
This is a blessing

235
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,450
from heaven.

236
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,720
You must cherish Sixi.

237
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,050
I know, Grandmother.

238
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,900
Didn't I tell you?

239
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,470
Add more cool water to the foot bath.

240
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,530
Don't make it so hot.

241
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,440
Your water...

242
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,620
Is the temperature okay?

243
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,840
Yes. Of course, it's just right.

244
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,200
Just right?

245
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,440
How nice.

246
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,990
Let me try it.

247
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,930
Let me try the water.

248
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,090
It's comfortable.

249
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,810
You're sweating.

250
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,690
You too.

251
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,120
I use that to wipe my feet.

252
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,210
It's fine, it's fine.

253
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,120
The water is a bit hot.

254
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,830
The water is hot.

255
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,770
Really?

256
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,790
Grandmother told me

257
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,350
you'll participate in the Tea Contest.

258
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,640
Yes, yes.

259
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,960
I support you.

260
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,930
Thank...Thanks.

261
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,290
You won't leave again, right?

262
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,640
When did I say I was leaving?

263
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,410
Soaking feet as a couple?

264
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,360
Why are you here?

265
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,020
A letter for you delivered

266
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,960
by a servant of the Ges.

267
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,070
Thanks.

268
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,020
Thanks, Donglin.

269
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,450
Enjoy. Bye.

270
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,010
What letter?

271
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,720
A classmate invited me for drinks.

272
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,440
They asked several times,
but I didn't go.

273
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,500
You should go.

274
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,440
Why not?

275
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,170
I don't feel like it now.

276
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,210
Though Ruan Ling is confident,

277
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,600
I still feel uneasy.

278
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,120
Uneasy or not,

279
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,380
you should still attend

280
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,600
these occasions.

281
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,990
As the Chief of a shop,

282
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,270
you need to interact with people,

283
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,580
or how can you do business?

284
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,600
- But I...
- Sixi is right.

285
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,720
A merchant

286
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,530
is someone who consults others.

287
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,090
More friends, more options.

288
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,600
How lovely.

289
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,500
Close the door.

290
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,440
Alright, alright.

291
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,690
Tomorrow, come with me.

292
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,370
Me?

293
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,590
I'll go too?

294
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,530
You're not going?

295
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,960
Just go.

296
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,580
(Anping Bridge)

297
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,060
(Jinyu Tea Plantation)

298
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,380
(Fragrant and Ethereal)

299
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,790
This is the fruit my cousin
prepared for you.

300
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,770
Thanks for coming back to help us.

301
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,560
Put it there.

302
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,990
Did you come back

303
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,430
only because you couldn't stand it?

304
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,250
Guiwei,

305
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,290
do you think

306
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,380
all good things

307
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,480
are unworthy of trust?

308
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,290
Do you know what I went through

309
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:55,930
with Kan?

310
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,640
Life is a matter of fate.

311
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,170
If you can help, you should.

312
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,020
Helping others

313
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,720
is helping yourself.

314
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,840
Understand?

315
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,890
Ruan,

316
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,830
I've been narrow.

317
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,880
Narrow-minded.

318
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,290
Oh, narrow-minded.

319
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,530
Eat some fruit.

320
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,250
Narrow-minded.

321
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,240
The noodles here are so good.

322
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,470
Sir, four bowls of noodles.

323
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,410
Alright.

324
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,680
Sit, sit.

325
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,430
- It's you.
- No.

326
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,930
- It's you.
- Really not.

327
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,290
Sorry.

328
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,320
Sit, sit.

329
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,190
When boiling water...

330
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,780
If bubbles appear like shrimp eye...

331
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,830
It really is you.

332
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,260
- I...
- Guys.

333
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,230
Catch this swindler!

334
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,380
Stop!

335
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,790
Stop!

336
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,760
It's fate that controls everything,

337
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,760
not humans at all.

338
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,560
Where is the tip?

339
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,690
Has Supervisor Lei's tea arrived?

340
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,080
You are...

341
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,370
I'm here to buy tea.

342
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,590
But our tea

343
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,260
just arrived this afternoon.

344
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,690
How did you know so soon?

345
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,620
We arranged it

346
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,880
beforehand.

347
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,880
How much has arrived?

348
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,840
About 120 to 130 jin.

349
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,960
I'll take it all.

350
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,570
Here's my address.

351
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,120
Notify me

352
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,000
anytime Supervisor Lei's tea arrives.

353
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,210
Here's the deposit.

354
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,230
My carriage

355
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,410
is already outside.

356
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,720
Please wait a moment.

357
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,740
Guiwei, Guiwei.

358
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,680
Pack the tea.

359
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,150
Mingxia, do I look good?

360
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,090
Yes.

361
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,130
No.

362
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,570
I don't think it's right.

363
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,100
Do you think I need

364
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,390
to ask Master Yunzhu

365
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,290
to guide me?

366
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,020
Madam,

367
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,530
are you interested in Yunzhu?

368
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,440
Don't talk nonsense.

369
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm so much older than he is.

370
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,920
Besides, he's so prominent.

371
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,160
He's seen many girls.

372
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,920
Madam, I was just joking.

373
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,330
Why take it seriously?

374
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,400
Is that how you joke?

375
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,240
Mother.

376
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,520
Slow down.

377
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,440
Mother.

378
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,430
A few days ago,

379
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,770
did Yunzhu come and sing?

380
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,440
Why didn't you call me?

381
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,190
I wanted to call you.

382
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,330
Could I even find you?

383
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,770
Where have you been these days?

384
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,640
I went to the hot springs

385
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,190
with the girls

386
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,130
from the Tea Guild.

387
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,300
If I had known Yunzhu
would be singing here,

388
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,530
who'd go to the hot springs?

389
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,810
You like listening to Yunzhu sing?

390
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,530
I'll have him

391
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,500
sing a song for you.

392
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,990
Just for me?

393
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,930
You want to hear it?

394
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,770
I'll find him right away.

395
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,170
Come on.

396
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,430
Hasn't my mother been

397
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,010
too nice to me today?

398
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,640
What's that noise?

399
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,060
Say something.

400
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't...

401
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,060
think so.

402
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,000
Why do I have to ask?

403
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,190
You lied.

404
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,050
You just think so.

405
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,440
Sixi's mother.

406
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,200
Sixi's mother.

407
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,820
Jiao'e, did you see Sixi's mother?

408
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,760
She was called away

409
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,680
by Ms. Luo.

410
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,530
Zhusi called her away?

411
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,120
You've been here for a while.

412
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,440
Is everything okay?

413
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,910
You're so meticulous.

414
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,290
Everything's perfect.

415
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,120
I have to thank you and Muyun.

416
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,570
Thank us for what?

417
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,190
That day at dinner...

418
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,500
That man...

419
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,400
When Chen was here...

420
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,760
Sorry

421
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,050
for losing control of myself.

422
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,570
I'm sorry.

423
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,990
I know you and Muyun

424
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,300
are both thinking of my best.

425
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,910
You wanted me to find

426
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,120
a good match.

427
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,580
I didn't mean that.

428
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,520
You're overthinking.

429
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,010
She didn't mean that.

430
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,250
Then I was overthinking.

431
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,090
Have some tea.

432
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,240
Okay.

433
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,680
Ms. Mai, I invited you today

434
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,570
to discuss something.

435
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,260
We're family.

436
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,810
Tell me what you need.

437
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,360
Alright, I'll say it.

438
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,360
I think

439
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,390
Jing Kan is

440
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,120
our only heir after all.

441
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,780
He must continue

442
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,840
the family line.

443
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,770
Naturally.

444
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,990
I'll urge them

445
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,440
to have a child asap.

446
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,720
Yes.

447
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,810
But to be safe,

448
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,930
I think it's better

449
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,010
to take a concubine for Jing Kan.

450
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,410
A concubine?

451
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,330
Yes, a concubine.

452
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,090
There are two girls.

453
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,970
Help me decide.

454
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,100
One is

455
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,640
a general's daughter,

456
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,680
fiery

457
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,400
and strong-willed.

458
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,160
The other

459
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,330
is from a scholarly family,

460
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,840
intelligent and accomplished

461
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,290
in everything.

462
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,020
Ms. Mai,

463
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,880
which of these two girls

464
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,840
do you think is better?

465
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,600
Actually, I think

466
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,730
one wife is fine.

467
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,250
Ms. Luo, you've been through it.

468
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,160
Surely, you feel the same.

469
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,200
Master Yunzhu has been

470
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,330
singing excellent Kun Opera

471
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,250
for us recently.

472
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,640
He's handsome, too.

473
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,570
Ms. Luo,

474
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,640
when I live here,

475
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,330
I'll inevitably have

476
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,810
some social obligations.

477
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,440
Well.

478
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,100
Ms. Xue

479
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,430
likes Yunzhu.

480
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,120
She invited him for a meal.

481
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,880
I must help her.

482
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,230
How about this?

483
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,600
I'll talk to Ms. Xue,

484
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,470
and I guarantee Yunzhu

485
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,490
won't come here again.

486
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,890
No, no.

487
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,530
Master Yunzhu must come.

488
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,430
Muyun

489
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,010
is too lonely.

490
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,300
We have to help her find a companion

491
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,500
to take care of her

492
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,640
by her side.

493
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,410
Anyway,

494
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,330
we'll have

495
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,330
a wedding soon.

496
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,680
It's either for Jing Kan or Muyun.

497
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,930
Ms. Mai,

498
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,530
who do you think is more urgent?

499
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,250
Sixi, Sixi.

500
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,300
You've found yourself

501
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,570
such a good mother-in-law.

502
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,600
Madam,

503
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,200
are you really going to play matchmaker

504
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,670
for Ms. Xue and Master Yunzhu?

505
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,280
Of course.

506
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,050
Why? Do you have objections?

507
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,650
No.

508
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,680
I just don't think Ms. Xue deserves him.

509
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,410
And you do?

510
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,920
Come on.

511
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,810
I'm just giving advice.

512
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,160
I know what you're thinking.

513
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,280
Think about it.

514
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,930
All these years,

515
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,680
I tried to find you several matches,

516
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,920
but none worked out.

517
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,330
Will Yunzhu like you?

518
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,160
Think about it, okay?

519
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,600
I'll never know without trying.

520
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,400
This is my wife, Qinxin.

521
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,970
That is Ge Yi's wife, Shiyun.

522
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,340
Pleasure to meet you.

523
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,280
Nice to meet you.

524
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,360
We and Jing Kan

525
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,490
were classmates at the school.

526
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,990
Have you shown

527
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,400
your poetry collection to Sixi?

528
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,400
You used to write poems?

529
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,970
That was in the past.

530
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,560
I'll show it when there's a chance.

531
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,910
Today, I brought

532
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,160
Mifangzong Tea with me.

533
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,490
Since everyone's here,

534
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,970
taste it.

535
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,400
I heard it's the new product
from Ruicao Tea.

536
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,870
Qinxin

537
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,010
has been wanting to try it.

538
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,230
The last thing I longed for like this

539
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,400
was Banfang Tea.

540
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,600
I'll pour some water for you.

541
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,440
Here.

542
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,130
Come on.

543
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,090
This tea is really good.

544
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,020
The tea soup is milky and smooth,

545
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,090
fragrant at the nose.

546
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,730
This tea is excellent.

547
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,100
Right?

548
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,970
I think Mifangzong is richer.

549
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,540
And the spring water here,

550
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,810
infused with bamboo fragrance,

551
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,120
makes it even fresher.

552
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,240
Indeed.

553
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,200
Here, let me get you more.

554
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,500
I think

555
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Sixi is also

556
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,050
a straightforward,

557
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,340
free-spirited girl.

558
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,430
Maybe she doesn't like

559
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,570
pretentious elegance like us.

560
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,970
No, a touch of elegance is good.

561
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,490
Why not drink some wine?

562
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,570
Sounds good.

563
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,810
I brought some fine wine.

564
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,680
Moonlit.

565
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,530
This is our family's private reserve.

566
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,310
- Here.
- Come on.

567
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,680
It's rare that we gather today.

568
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,050
Why not drink

569
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,120
with poetry as before?

570
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,400
Great, I'll start.

571
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,580
The waters of the Yellow River
come from the sky.

572
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,910
And rush to the sea.

573
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,250
Facing the mirror,
our parents find their hair gray.

574
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,880
In the blink of an eye, things change.

575
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,400
One must enjoy to the fullest
in the prime of life.

576
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,330
Good.

577
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,010
Do not let the cup face the moon empty.

578
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,200
One must be here for a reason.

579
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,600
A thousand gold spent always comes back.

580
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,710
Let us be merry,
surrounded by lamb and beef.

581
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,530
Let us drink as much as we can.

582
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,560
I agree.

583
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,530
Danqiu.

584
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,400
Let us drink.

585
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,430
Do not stop.

586
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,440
I'll sing a song for you.

587
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,810
Please listen carefully.

588
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,090
Where's Sixi?

589
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,720
Sixi.

590
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,500
Do you want roasted chicken?

591
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,440
I'll go buy it.

592
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,990
Come on.

593
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,910
Let's drink.

594
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,850
Come on.

595
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,400
What a surprise.

596
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,010
You used to write poems.

597
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,290
And your friends

598
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,680
seem very learned.

599
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,250
You're great, too.

600
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,090
How so?

601
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,680
Everyone was rushing to eat

602
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,120
the roasted chicken you bought.

603
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,820
You don't have

604
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,050
to praise me.

605
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,950
No offense.

606
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,570
I sincerely think

607
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,100
learned people like you

608
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,050
are impressive.

609
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,430
Sixi,

610
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,730
do you want to learn to write?

611
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,040
I can teach you.

612
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,330
I can't learn.

613
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,190
When I hold a brush,

614
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,360
it feels heavier than a knife.

615
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,780
Believe in yourself.

616
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,720
You can do it.

617
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,050
Let's go. I'll teach you.

618
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,720
Let's go.

619
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,880
Write it properly. Level and straight.

620
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,900
(Ban)

621
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,360
Pause here.

622
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,530
Let there be a touch.

623
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,720
Just...

624
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,130
Ai Sixi.

625
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,610
Jing Kan.

626
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,770
Look at this brush rest.

627
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,200
Does it look like some hills?

628
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,500
The waves on top

629
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,600
look like the sea.

630
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,730
I'm teaching you how to write.

631
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,170
When I start

632
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,060
to write,

633
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,780
everything somehow

634
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,840
becomes interesting.

635
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,910
Learning requires perseverance.

636
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,680
Sure, perseverance.

637
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,130
Ban.

638
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,020
(Ban)

639
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,630
You've learned this, right?

640
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,970
Yes, Ban.

641
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,500
How did the inventor of Ban

642
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,670
decide it was Ban?

643
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,740
Let's learn Fang next.

644
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,780
No, I can only learn
one character a day.

645
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,290
My head seems to be going to explode.

646
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,250
I need to lie down immediately.

647
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,570
So comfortable.

648
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,870
My grandfather said

649
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,430
we should stand instead of sitting

650
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,730
and sit instead of lying.

651
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,470
Limbs need some labor.

652
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,910
Sixi, you should move more.

653
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,950
It's good for your health.

654
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,840
That painting is by our mother, right?

655
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,960
Yes.

656
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,050
She was really talented

657
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,200
to paint such a large work.

658
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,480
Jing Kan,

659
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,920
look at this tree.

660
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,490
Does it look like the character Ban?

661
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,680
I won't force you to learn,

662
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,330
so stop acting.

663
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,020
No, it really looks like it.

664
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,960
Look.

665
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,250
Come and see.

666
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,990
I've seen it since childhood.

667
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,090
Let me see where Ban is.

668
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,670
- Look
- Where is Ban?

669
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,540
Look, here, here.

670
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,430
Here, here.

671
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,400
See? Isn't it Ban?

672
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,740
So,

673
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,880
what are we looking at?

674
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,360
Why ask?

675
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,400
After checking closely,
I do think it's Ban.

676
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,190
Look here.

677
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,290
There's also a turtle.

678
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,260
This...

679
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,680
Could this be a map?

680
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,040
A map?

681
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,840
Look at the turtle.

682
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,770
This is Shigui Lake.

683
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,810
The white crane is Mount Crane.

684
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,640
So,

685
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,670
this camellia

686
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,050
must be the Plantation.

687
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,170
Then,

688
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,920
isn't this a map of Taiping County?

689
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,530
Well. I think so.

690
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,730
It's true.

691
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,880
It matches perfectly.

692
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,500
And the Ban character is?

693
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,010
That is where our mother is buried.

694
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,010
Could Banfang Tea...

695
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,300
(Fragrant and Ethereal)

696
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,720
Sixi, Kan, where are you going?

697
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,180
(Tomb of Mother Qin Baoyi)

698
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,040
Mother,

699
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,910
if you have a spirit in heaven,

700
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,120
can you give me a clue?

701
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,500
Did you leave a hint

702
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,570
about Banfang Tea?

703
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,820
(Tomb of Mother Qin Baoyi)

704
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,760
Nothing.

705
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,680
Jing Kan.

706
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,090
There's nothing.

707
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,480
Listen.

708
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,010
I dug up all the trees around here,

709
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,360
even the stumps.

710
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,630
Nothing looks

711
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,680
like something was buried.

712
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,650
Do you think

713
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,630
it could have been

714
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,470
with Mother in the coffin?

715
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,410
No.

716
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,670
I buried everything

717
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,680
in this tomb.

718
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,030
Then,

719
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,190
should I go dig in the creek

720
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,280
at the foot of the mountain?

721
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,130
No need.

722
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,690
We just haven't understood
what Mother meant.

723
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,010
I think I understand a little.

724
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,200
What?

725
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,010
It's not just our mother's tomb here.

726
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,640
There's also an old man.

727
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,890
Old man?

728
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,610
Mr. An.

729
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,570
Did my mother leave anything for you?

730
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,850
Yes.

731
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,240
What?

732
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,290
The tea trees outside.

733
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,100
I mean,

734
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,300
did my mother leave any clues

735
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,120
about the making of Banfang Tea?

736
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,340
If she did,

737
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,530
would I be unable
to make Banfang Tea?

738
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,430
Did she ever talk to you about it

739
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,530
while she was alive?

740
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,970
Whenever she mentioned it,

741
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,730
she always seemed a bit sad.

742
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,020
Why?

743
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,050
She missed your father.

744
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,330
She said Banfang Tea

745
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,290
came from a sudden inspiration

746
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,010
she had with your father

747
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,670
while reading the Seven Bowls of Tea.

748
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,920
Seven Bowls of Tea?

749
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,530
What inspiration?

750
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,870
Seven Bowls of Tea?

751
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,100
Is it the same poem

752
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,040
that Guiwei recites?

753
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,810
The first bowl moistens the throat.

754
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,810
The second bowl dispels loneliness.

755
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,530
The third bowl leads to deep thoughts.

756
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,600
Only voluminous books remain.

757
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,570
The first bowl dries the throat.

758
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,730
The second bowl kills loneliness.

759
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,170
The third bowl...

760
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,400
You recited it wrong.

761
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,780
I've memorized it for decades.

762
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,730
How could I be wrong?

763
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,730
I remember Guiwei said,

764
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,440
"The first bowl dries the throat."

765
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,370
"Dries"?

766
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
Jinyu Tea's pan-firing

767
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,840
follows a consistent principle.

768
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,230
All freshly picked leaves

769
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,670
must go through water removal

770
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,770
by withering and drying.

771
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,970
There is a drying step.

772
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,050
Could this be a step
to make Banfang Tea?

773
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,820
Could Mother have hidden the method

774
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,920
in that painting?

775
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,090
For my happiness,

776
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,600
I'll accept the punishment.

777
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,850
Master Yunzhu,

778
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,490
sorry for the long wait.

779
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,890
You are...

780
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,870
Ms. Luo and Ms. Mai

781
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,970
had something come up,

782
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,280
so they'll be a little late.

783
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,770
Master Yunzhu,

784
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,050
let me drink with you first.

785
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,330
Sorry.

786
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,050
I never drink.

787
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,960
Master Yunzhu,

788
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,680
this wine isn't intoxicating.

789
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,820
Please try it.

790
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,760
I really don't drink.

791
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,860
Just one sip, please.

792
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,160
Master Yunzhu.

793
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,200
Master Yunzhu.

794
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,240
Why are you here?

795
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,720
Ms. Xue, why did you come?

796
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,640
I haven't invited you yet.

797
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,350
Master Yunzhu is here.

798
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,490
No need for you to invite me.

799
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,620
I heard his voice from far away.

800
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,560
Leave us.

801
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Master Yunzhu.

802
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,960
Put it here.

803
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,930
- The wine...
- What about it?

804
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,060
Master Yunzhu can't drink.

805
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,000
Put it here.

806
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,640
Leave us.

807
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,490
Sorry, Yunzhu.

808
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,060
Actually,

809
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,850
I've long wanted to invite you over.

810
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,050
And you suddenly came.

811
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm so happy.

812
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,330
Here.

813
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,720
Since you came today,

814
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,450
I'll toast to you.

815
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,930
Ms. Xue, I don't drink.

816
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,890
Then I'll drink it myself.

817
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,890
Good wine.

818
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,690
Master Yunzhu,

819
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,410
I want to toast you again.

820
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,240
Oh, you don't drink.

821
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,780
Then I'll drink it for you.

822
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,040
Good wine.

823
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,040
Master Yunzhu,

824
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,020
I've always wanted

825
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,370
to ask you a question.

826
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,810
Please go ahead.

827
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,410
When you performed that day,

828
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,540
there was a gesture

829
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,620
I just can't remember.

830
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,570
Just like this.

831
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,760
Is this gesture right?

832
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,240
You want to know about this?

833
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,160
The hands should be like this.

834
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,780
- Look at me.
- Sure.

835
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,010
- Here...
- Come over to teach me.

836
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,540
Ms. Xue, look.

837
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,480
This hand...

838
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,530
They come here like this.

839
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,160
Come here? Okay.

840
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
The key is to coordinate

841
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,960
with your own posture.

842
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,810
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

843
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,870
The most important thing is

844
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,970
the feeling in your heart.

845
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,500
Match it with your eyes.

846
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,490
Convey your inner feelings
through your gaze.

847
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,950
It's like seeing

848
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,570
the beautiful scenery

849
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,090
from afar.

850
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,970
Ms. Xue, do you understand?

851
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,960
Give me a kiss.

852
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,090
Oh, my.

853
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,640
Please compose yourself.

854
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,370
Oh, my.

855
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,200
I love it when you act like this.

856
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,080
Come.

857
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,200
Everyone, listen.

858
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,410
From now on, our maids

859
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,280
must not use

860
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,010
floral perfume.

861
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,100
We deal with tea.

862
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,420
Only the tea fragrance is allowed.

863
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,750
I can't stand strange smells.

864
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,830
I need to be quick.

865
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,890
- Yes.
- Be quick!

866
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,830
My Lady.

867
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,770
Are you blind?

868
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,010
My Lady, bad news.

869
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,120
Ms. Xue is

870
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,200
about to do something outrageous.

871
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,100
Where is she?

872
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,180
Let's go.

873
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,220
Let's go.

874
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,680
Give me a hug.

875
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,690
Come on, come.

876
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,210
Listen.

877
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,700
(Vibrant and Splendid)

878
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,060
Give me a hug.

879
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,090
Please control yourself.

880
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,440
Give me a hug.

881
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,640
Just give me a hug.

882
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,010
What are you doing?

883
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,530
Get out, go.

884
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,050
Xue Muyun!

885
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,150
