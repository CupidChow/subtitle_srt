What are you doing?

27

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,580
you can't catch a draft after sweating.

Don't close the window.

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,270
I'm putting on makeup.

31
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,960
I need some light.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,240
Why put on makeup now?

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,730
I don't want you

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,650
to remember me

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,370
as a miserable-looking woman
in the future.

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,050
That's nonsense.

37
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,330
Come on, wipe it off.

38
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,280
Don't mess up my makeup.

39
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,170
I will fix it for you.

Come on.

41
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,240
Mother,

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,860
did you force me

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,890
to get married back then

44
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,840
because you knew you had this illness?

45
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,490
I just found out.

46
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,120
Stop lying to me.

47
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,240
Physician Wei said

48
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,560
you didn't get this illness overnight.

49
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,890
Mother, I heard

50
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,510
there's a divine physician
on Mount Liuhua

51
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,070
who specializes in treating tumors.

52
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,260
Let's go see him.

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Sixi,

54
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,020
didn't we agree already?

55
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,620
When we leave this world,

56
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,780
let's do it with some grace.

57
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,580
Grace, I know.

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,020
I'll definitely let you go with grace.

59
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,860
It's just...

60
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,400
Well.

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,500
When people get a headache,

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,860
don't they have to see a physician?

63
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,740
And you've never been to Mount Liuhua.

64
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,340
Let's treat it as a trip.

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,020
Seeing you

66
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,540
already leaves me no regrets.

67
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,180
Your betrothal gifts,

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,540
plus the last bit of money

69
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,500
I have left,

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,780
are with Yunzhu.

71
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,740
Go buy something you like.

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,660
Consider it the last gift

73
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,900
I give you.

74
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,820
Take it back.

75
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,180
I don't want it. You keep it.

76
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,780
I want to go up the mountain
to watch the sunset.

77
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,860
(Jing Residence)

78
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,380
Young...

79
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,180
Young Master.

80
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,740
Young Master.

81
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,860
- Young Master.
- You can't...

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,420
Help!

83
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,500
Jing Nanfeng.

84
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,380
Jing Nanfeng.

85
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,060
I knew

86
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,380
you went to Laolongtan Tea.

87
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,100
I knew you were after me.

88
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,420
How dare you

89
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,420
play the righteous card with me?

90
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,980
You're no match for me.

91
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,420
Did you kill my mother?

92
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,920
Tan Long called you over

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,840
just to say this?

94
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,540
That's all Tan Long can do.

95
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,180
Did you kill my mother?

96
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,860
Yes.

97
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,500
You...

98
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
Since you've found out this secret,

99
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,860
let me tell you another one.

100
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,980
Back in the day,

101
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,780
Laolongtan Tea

102
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,340
sent a spy to our family.

103
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,340
Guess who this spy was.

104
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,420
This spy was your mother,

105
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,340
Qin Baoyi.

106
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,300
You're lying!

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,860
Your father was really something.

108
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,620
They sent a spy over

109
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,580
to steal

110
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,740
our pan-firing method.

111
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,980
But your father

112
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
just won over

113
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,900
this spy.

114
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,180
Your father was truly something.

115
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,060
Your father

116
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
was truly something.

117
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,380
Impossible.

118
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
Impossible.

119
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,060
Impossible.

120
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,300
Grandmother,

121
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,020
is my mother really

122
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,540
a spy sent by Laolongtan Tea?

123
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,740
Yes.

124
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,300
Did my father know?

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,460
He knew.

126
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,820
Did he fall in love with her first,

127
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,540
or did he know she was a spy first?

128
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,620
Does it matter?

129
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,660
Your father and your mother
were truly in love.

130
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,420
You don't have to doubt that.

131
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,300
But how did my mother really die?

132
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,340
Your parents

133
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,180
jointly developed Banfang Tea.

134
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,260
When Tan Long found out,

135
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,620
he kept sending people over

136
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,820
to demand it from your mother.

137
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,780
Your mother refused

138
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,780
and became exhausted.

139
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,820
I told you long ago

140
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,380
that some families gather

141
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,780
to repay a debt of gratitude,

142
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,700
while others

143
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,940
come together to forgive each other.

144
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,180
Now, you should understand.

145
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,420
Why is life so tiring?

146
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,740
(Taiping County)

147
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,780
Because people

148
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,620
often have no choice.

149
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,380
But there's one thing you must remember.

150
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,020
The most important thing for a person

151
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,420
is to have a clear conscience.

152
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,220
Who told you to touch my clothes?

153
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,700
I don't need your care.

154
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,620
Aji,

155
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,020
I just want to do more

156
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,140
of what I should have done before.

157
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,180
Seeing you now just annoys me.

158
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,380
Jing Kan,

159
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,180
your leg...

160
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,180
Did you know my mother was sent

161
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,940
by Laolongtan Tea?

162
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,700
Jing Nanfeng told you, didn't he?

163
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
You just need to tell me

164
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,880
whether you know or not.

165
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,660
It's all in the past.

166
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,780
You hate me so much.

167
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

168
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,420
Because I'm also a mother.

169
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,260
Now, I finally understand

170
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,300
why you didn't let

171
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,420
Jing Nanfeng come back.

172
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,500
He's a disaster

173
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,620
to the Jing Clan.

174
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,900
I can't worry
about the Jing Clan anymore.

175
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,300
I just want to be with Aji.

176
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,740
Jing Kan,

177
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,820
you've grown up.

178
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,300
There are some things

179
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,060
you need to face

180
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,900
all by yourself.

181
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,620
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,780
You've been here

183
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,500
for more than ten days.

184
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,180
It's time to go back.

185
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,020
The shop has Guiwei and Jing Kan.

186
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,300
Don't worry about them.

187
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,710
I'll stay right here.

188
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,060
I remember you said

189
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,660
you wanted to visit 12 mountains.

190
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,940
You've been to 4 already, right?

191
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
I'll go with you

192
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,900
to the remaining eight.

193
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Then I will

194
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,260
follow you step by step.

195
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,020
Don't think about leaving me behind.

196
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,620
Alright.

197
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,780
In the past, I thought

198
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,020
a life full of excitement

199
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,500
was what a lifetime was all about.

200
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,380
But now,

201
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,380
suddenly,

202
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,060
all the beautiful scenery I've seen

203
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,980
and all the delicious food I've tasted

204
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,660
seem insignificant to me.

205
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,140
The most important thing now is you.

206
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,620
Only when you're by my side

207
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,620
do I feel that my life

208
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,020
hasn't been in vain,

209
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,900
like a willow catkin

210
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,300
floating through this world.

211
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,780
People find a home
when they have something to hold on to.

212
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,660
Sixi.

213
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,140
I used to tell you

214
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,180
to be yourself.

215
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,700
Being yourself doesn't mean

216
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,020
doing whatever you want.

217
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,140
It means doing what you should do.

218
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,260
That's how you find the real you.

219
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,420
Loving yourself is important,

220
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,540
but

221
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,300
you also need to protect Jing Kan

222
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,700
and this family.

223
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,300
That's another way of loving yourself.

224
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,500
It's loving your future self.

225
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,060
You need to be someone

226
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,020
who can look themselves in the eye
in a relationship.

227
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,300
This is my last wish.

228
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,420
I'll remember, Mother.

229
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,820
I'll always be with you, Mother.

230
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,020
You'll get better.

231
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,500
I think

232
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,020
this is the best time for me.

233
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,020
It seems

234
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,540
I won't be able to see the sunset today.

235
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,460
Mother,

236
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,140
you should take a nap.

237
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,540
I'll wake you up when the sunset comes.

238
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,900
Mother,

239
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,500
look.

240
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,180
The sunset is here.

241
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,780
Mother?

242
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,780
Mother...

243
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,500
Mother...

244
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,740
The sunset is here.

245
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,460
It doesn't hurt anymore, Mother.

246
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,660
Mother, it's okay.

247
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,420
It won't hurt anymore.

248
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,380
It won't hurt anymore, Mother.

249
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,180
The sunset is here, Mother.

250
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,920
How many taels do I have left?

251
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,860
If you count the remaining shops,

252
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,140
it's less than 3,000 taels.

253
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,540
Nanfeng,

254
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,860
let's stop for today.

255
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,500
With the green hills,

256
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,860
there will be firewood to burn.

257
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,940
We'll come again tomorrow.

258
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,900
3,000 taels,

259
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,260
all in.

260
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,620
The last round.

261
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
Alright, come on.

262
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,980
Open.

263
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,760
Four, five, six. Big for Landlord Ye.

264
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,460
Let's go again.

265
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
I'm sorry, Chief Jing.

266
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,580
You can't have another round.

267
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,480
Don't I still have the tea hill?

268
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,940
You lost it a long time ago.

269
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,340
Mortgage my family's house.

270
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,180
You have to bring the deed, too.

271
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,820
What do you mean?

272
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,500
Am I someone who can't pay back

273
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
and defaults on debts?

274
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,220
Let him gamble.

275
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,900
I believe

276
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,980
Chief Jing.

277
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,580
But Nanfeng,

278
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,340
you've lost everything

279
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,060
you have.

280
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,980
How about this?

281
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,580
I'm not unsympathetic.

282
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,660
Tell me how to make Aji Tea.

283
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,380
I'll count it as 3,000 taels.

284
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,500
How about that?

285
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,580
3,000 taels?

286
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,900
Chief Tan,

287
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,660
I also know how to make Anzhou Sweetie.

288
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
If we combine them,

289
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,020
give me 10,000 taels.

290
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,820
Jing Nanfeng,

291
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,940
how long do you think you can play me?

292
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,820
Jing Kan.

293
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,620
You've come at just the right time.

294
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,320
Tell them how to make Anzhou Sweetie.

295
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,060
Tell them. With one round,

296
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,620
I can turn things around.

297
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,260
What I'm holding is

298
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,680
the method of making Anzhou Sweetie.

299
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
I'll gamble with this.

300
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,860
How much do you want to gamble?

301
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,260
I want to gamble

302
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
his life.

303
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,100
Gamble his life?

304
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,060
I want to see

305
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,580
if the method of making Anzhou Sweetie

306
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,460
can be worth a life.

307
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,180
What do you mean?

308
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,220
As long as any of you kill him,

309
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,300
the method of making Anzhou Sweetie

310
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,260
will be yours.

311
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,020
Are you crazy?

312
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,300
You're the one who's crazy.

313
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,380
Do you have any idea

314
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,100
what this family has become
because of you?

315
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,420
Jing Kan.

316
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,020
Jing Kan,

317
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,820
give me one more chance, okay?

318
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,260
Save me, can you?

319
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,060
I really can't think

320
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,700
of any other way to save this family.

321
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,900
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,940
I'm really sorry.

323
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,340
I'm wrong, okay?

324
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,500
Jing Kan,

325
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,660
hand over Anzhou Sweetie,

326
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,660
and you can save me.

327
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,700
Just one round.

328
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,020
One round,

329
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,420
and I can bring our family

330
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,180
back to its feet.

331
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,500
You're beyond redemption.

332
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,900
Catch him.

333
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,580
Don't move.

334
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,180
Who dares to move?

335
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,100
Hand over the method
of making Anzhou Sweetie.

336
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,100
Hand it over.

337
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,980
You're dreaming.

338
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,740
Jing Kan.

339
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,380
Jing Kan, Jing Kan.

340
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,980
Jing Kan.

341
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,900
Jing Kan.

342
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,920
Jing Kan.

343
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,740
I'm your uncle.

344
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,340
Mr. Tan, got it.

345
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,500
- Who told you to move?
- Murder!

346
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,700
Who told you to kill him?

347
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,660
Murder!

348
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,500
Murder!

349
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,580
Why stand there?

350
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,100
Go and catch him!

351
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,100
Did I tell you to kill him?

352
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,180
Did I?

353
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,180
What are you looking at?

354
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,900
Get rid of him.

355
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,740
Throw him into the river.

356
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,420
(Pure and Pretty)

357
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,060
Please bless Jing Kan

358
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,500
and our family.

359
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,700
The money...

360
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,940
Where's the money?

361
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,500
Jing Nanfeng, why are you back?

362
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,580
Where's Jing Kan?

363
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,380
- Where's Jing Kan?
- Find all the money

364
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,300
in the house.

365
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,340
What are you doing?

366
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,820
What are you doing?

367
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm leaving, of course.

368
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
If I don't leave, I'll die here.

369
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,460
Jing Nanfeng, are you even human?

370
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,220
You've ruined the family business,

371
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,660
and now you've put Jing Kan's life

372
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,740
in danger.

373
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,000
We don't even know where he is.

374
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,380
And you want to leave?

375
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,230
Where's the money?

376
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,140
Where are you going?

377
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,100
You're too merciful.

378
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,260
You're crazy!

379
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Give me the ring!

380
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,820
No, what are you doing?

381
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,060
What are you doing?

382
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,300
Give it to me.

383
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,420
Jing Nanfeng!

384
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,300
How dare you hit me?

385
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,220
I told you long ago

386
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,420
I'm not a child anymore.

387
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,340
Mother,

388
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,300
what should we do now?

389
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,040
Should I hit him a few more times?

390
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,580
He might wake up soon.

391
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,460
Alright.

392
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,710
You can

393
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
- die!
- My goodness.

394
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,580
Alright, alright.

395
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,940
- Just die!
- Enough.

396
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,100
Calm down, calm down.

397
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,300
Don't kill him.

398
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,260
Calm down.

399
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,420
Are you okay?

400
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,280
I'm fine.

401
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,220
Let me see your hand.

402
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,740
It's okay.

403
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,100
Good girl.

404
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,700
You started to protect me.

405
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,060
Madam, Madam.

406
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,100
Madam.

407
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,020
What's wrong?

408
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,060
Mother, I'm wrong.

409
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,500
Please spare my life.

410
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,500
Mother.

411
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,180
Mother, I'm wrong.

412
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,620
I was despicable. I'm wrong.

413
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,860
I swear that once I leave this family,

414
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,620
I will never come back, Mother.

415
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,500
Go.

416
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,620
Remove his name

417
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,500
from the family register.

418
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,500
Yes.

419
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,140
Alright, remove it.

420
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,180
Mother, you can do whatever you want.

421
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,400
Bring the Qingming Stick.

422
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,060
Mother, beat me.

423
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,580
You can beat me however you want.

424
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,860
Mother, please spare my life.

425
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,180
Lock him up.

426
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,620
I'll personally send him to the yamen.

427
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,700
- Mother.
- Mother.

428
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,660
Mother.

429
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,140
Mother, I...

430
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,100
Dear,

431
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,340
you're my dear wife.

432
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,740
Save me.

433
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,900
Help me.

434
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,020
Mother,

435
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
it's getting late.

436
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,260
I'll accompany you.

437
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
Let's go.

438
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,940
Mother.

439
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,420
Mother!

440
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,660
- My Lady.
- Grandmother.

441
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,100
- Mother.
- My Lady.

442
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,460
What's wrong?

443
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,100
Tie him up.

444
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,660
It's you who corrupted Wang.

445
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,020
Tie him up properly.

446
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,100
Don't make a mess.

447
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,500
Tie him tight.

448
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,900
Mother.

449
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,060
- Mother.
- Zhusi.

450
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,340
It's okay.

451
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,420
Pull yourself together.

452
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,420
Any news about Jing Kan?

453
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,260
No.

454
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,420
No news

455
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,060
is good news.

456
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,500
Jiao'e,

457
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,820
go along the river

458
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,900
and ask the nearby residents

459
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,660
if they've seen Jing Kan.

460
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,580
Find some good swimmers

461
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,900
to search the river.

462
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,860
Yes.

463
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,700
Donglin,

464
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,140
go invite Physician Shi

465
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,900
to be on standby at home.

466
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Muyun,

467
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,900
stay by Mother's side

468
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,380
and don't leave.

469
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,220
Alright.

470
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,780
Cuiying!

471
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860
Take out

472
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,820
all my money.

473
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,380
If there's no news by tomorrow morning,

474
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,280
ask Mr. Tian,
Chief of the escort agency,

475
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,220
to help search.

476
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,180
Yes.

477
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,900
Good, let's act separately.

478
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,100
Zhusi.

479
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,220
Thank you.

480
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,260
Mother.

481
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,460
We're family. No need for this.

482
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,420
Hurry.

483
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,540
Take him to the yamen.

484
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,500
Grandmother.

485
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,700
- Tie him tight.
- Don't be angry.

486
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,340
Zhusi is back. Everything will be fine.

487
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,300
Young Master!

488
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,040
Young Master!

489

Young Master!

490

- Young Master!
- Young Master!

492
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,120
Sixi.

493
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,260
Young Master!

494
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,500
Look at these clothes.

495
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,060
Where did you find them?

496
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,580
By the river outside the city.

497
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,380
It's your cousin-in-law's.

498
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,260
It's Jing Kan's.

499
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,060
- Sixi.
- No.

500
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,020
Jing Kan.

501
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,340
- Jing Kan.
- Sixi.

502
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,060
It can't be, it can't be.

503
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,580
He'll be fine.

504
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,900
He'll be fine.

The Jing Clan is done for.

508
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,420
Yes.

509
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
All the men

510
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,700
are either dead or in jail.

511
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,500
What bad fortune for the family.

512
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,060
Jinyu Tea used to be so big.

513
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,460
I heard now

514
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,220
there's only one shop left.

515
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,580
People rely on luck.

516
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,860
Obviously, this family

517
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,140
has run out of luck.

518
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,380
There are only women left in the family.

519
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,820
Sooner or later,
they'll be wiped out.

520
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
Yes.

521
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,740
What can a bunch of women do?

522
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,700
Indeed.

523
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,820
Your mouth accounts

524
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,980
for most of your body weight.

525
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,700
Why chatter here at the entrance?

526
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,380
If you have the guts, go inside.

527
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,500
Come in.

528
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,620
How nice the weather is.

529
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,060
Yes, it's quite hot.

530
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,540
- Go.
- Where are you going?

531
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,060
Don't leave. Keep chattering.

532
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,180
Continue doing that.

533
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,960
You'll never eat three dishes
in a lifetime.

(Youming Tea Shop)

This here is

536
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,780
the best we have in our shop.

537
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,740

Alright.

540
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,100
Take these two packs back

541
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,500
and try them.

542
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,580

come again.

Let's go.

546
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,060
Take care.

547
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,500
Take care.

548
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,760
Come again if you like it.

549
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,300
By the way, Guiwei,

550
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
there are two boxes of goods
in North Warehouse.

551
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,220
Remember to take them.

552

Alright.

Come on, it's time to eat.

555
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,660
Good, clean up.

556
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,820
Clean up.

557
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,500
What else?

558
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,620
Don't always do that.

559
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,000
Ms. Xue's cooking is really good.

560
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,380
Of course.

561
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,100
My mother's cooking
has always been good.

562
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,420
But ever since Ms. Xue

563
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,700
took charge,

564
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,280
she hasn't kept a single maid,

565
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,340
except for me.

566
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,300
Why don't you leave then?

567
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,180
Because you're the prettiest maid.

568
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,660
Leave.

569
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,760
You two can leave together.

570
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,900
So annoying.

571
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,180
I'll find a new master right away,

572
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,100
and then I'll leave.

573
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,020
Jiao'e.

574
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,820
What? Are you going to miss me?

575
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,360
It depends on how you behave.

576
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,060
My goodness.

577
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,260
- Is it enough?
- Yeah.

578
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,700
Is anyone here? I'd like some tea.

579
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,620
A customer is here.

580
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,820
Coming.

581
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,460
Oh, my, look at him.

582
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,940
Where's Sixi?

583
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,380
She's looking

584
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,220
at a tea hill,

585
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,180
preparing to buy it.

586
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,740
With the family in this situation,

587
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,020
why buy a tea hill?

588
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,180
What do you know?

589
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,420
That's called having a vision.

590
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,860
What's the use of that?

591
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,380
It's been a year now.

592
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,180
Do you think Sixi has accepted

593
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,800
that Jing Kan is gone?

594
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,700
Who could accept that?

595
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,020
Could you?

596
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,520
I'd go crazy if it were me.

597
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,900
But she hasn't cried

598
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,980
or even mentioned it.

599
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,180
No one knows what's going on.

600
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,340
You'd cry privately, right?

601
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,420
Besides, crying isn't going

602
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,820
to bring the dead back to life.

603
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,100
You just expect people to cry.

604
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,220
What are you talking about?

605
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,180
Sixi's here.

606
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,660
We were talking about your tea hill.

607
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,620
It's been settled.

608
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,620
That's great.

609
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,180
- Hurry up and eat.
- Okay.

610
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,700
- Eat.
- You came back just in time.

611
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,260
Auntie is good.

612
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,820
She even made meat dishes today.

613
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,700
It must've cost a lot.

614
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,180
She knows you work hard.

615
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,560
- Eat more meat.
- Okay.

616
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,660
I have another thing.

617
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,040
I've found a good location
for the branch store.

618
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,240
It will open in a few days.

619
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,660
That's good.

620
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,460
- We'll be busy.
- It's a good thing.

621
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,620
So, Zhenzhu,

622
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,100
it's not quite right for you

623
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,020
to keep helping here.

624
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,400
I want to ask you

625
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,280
to become the Chief
of the Anping Bridge Shop.

626
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,220
No, no, no.

627
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,820
You can't joke about this.

628
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,740
Here's the thing.

629
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
Sixi,

630
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,260
though I used to want your shop,

631
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,740
Donglin already has

632
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,060
seven or eight shops now.

633
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,500
I don't even want to go there.

634
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,340
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

635
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,380
I don't even want to be
in charge of the Tea Guild.

636
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,540
Aren't you going to regret it?

637
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
What's there to regret?

638
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,780
It's not easy to get pregnant.

639
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,460
Shouldn't I rest?

640
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,060
I'm just afraid

641
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,460
you'll want it later.

642
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,900
My goodness, don't be afraid.

643
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,860
I won't want it.

644
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,100
Sixi, how about letting me be

645
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,940
the Chief of the branch store?

646
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,660
You?

647
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,860
I'm a little afraid now.

648
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,820
Really afraid.

649
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
Sit down and eat.

650
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,340
I've had someone in mind

651
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,700
for the Chief of the branch store.

652
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,020
Hurry up and eat.

653
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,380
Mother,

654
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,620
I heard

655
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,700
the other day

656
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,940
that people are saying

657
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,700
the Jing Clan still has

658
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,100
a daughter-in-law like me

659
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,780
at home.

660
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,220
You're my daughter-in-law,

661
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,660
and even I won't pursue this.

662
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,740
What does it have to do
with anyone else?

663
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,180
Besides,

664
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,660
who hasn't done foolish things

665
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,260
when they were young?

666
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,260
Zhusi,

667
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,380
it's only when I reached my age

668
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,740
that I realized

669
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,540
the things

670
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,660
that used to seem important to you

671
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,420
actually aren't that important.

672
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
It's the things

673
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,180
that seem unimportant

674
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,380
that are truly important.

675
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,060
So, what's unimportant?

676
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,940
Anything that bothers you
is unimportant.

677
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,100
So, what's important then?

678
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,900
Playing madiao.

679
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,940
Yes, playing madiao
is the most important.

680
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,300
Let's play madiao.

681
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,300
You hung up that sheet?

682
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,220
You're here.

683
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,700
- What's wrong?
- Zhusi.

684
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,780
My waist feels like it's broken.

685
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,860
- Alright, Mother.
- My hands hurt.

686
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,380
After thinking it over,

687
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,260
I think we need to find a maid.

688
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,100
I haven't washed clothes for years.

689
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,140
It's not feasible

690
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,420
to rely just on me and Cuiying.

691
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,820
Muyun, you finally changed your mind.

692
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,300
If you're going to find maids,

693
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,580
find three.

694
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
One to wash,

695
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
one to wring,

696
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,660
and one to hang.

697
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,780
Perfect.

698
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,380
As if I don't know

699
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,300
what you're thinking.

700
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,420
Forget about three.

701
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,220
I don't even want to find one.

702
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
By the way,

703
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,980
Zhusi,

704
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,160
about Aji's betrothal gifts,

705
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,300
what should we say?

706
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,300
His parents

707
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,700
have prepared it for him.

708
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,060
Given my status,

709
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,700
it's not appropriate.

710
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,300
Since we're family,

711
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,660
I'll just be straightforward.

712
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,870
You know

713
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,940
the situation at home now.

714
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,560
We can't afford to spend a lot of money.

715
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,700
But altogether,

716
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,260
we've managed to gather
600 taels of silver.

717
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,220
Donglin contributed 200 taels,

718
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,620
Sixi contributed 200 taels,

719
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,300
the family contributed 100 taels,

720
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,620
and the remaining hundred taels

721
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,820
come from your branch.

722
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,220
Ms. Xue,

723
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,220
didn't I tell you not to say that?

724
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,580
I have to say it.

725
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,940
I can't let you give the money

726
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,460
into the shadows.

727
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,060
Madam, let me make this clear.

728
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,060
I saved 100 taels of silver.

729
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,780
It's not taken from the family.

730
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,180
You have money.

731
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,260
You're a wealthy woman.

732
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,300
Of course, I want

733
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,060
to contribute to Aji's wedding.

734
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,100
Mother,

735
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,580
Muyun,

736
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,420
I think 600 taels is too much.

737
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,860
Our family

738
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,540
needs money right now.

739
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,100
- How about...
- Stop.

740
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,100
Now, I'm in charge.

741
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,900
This matter is settled.

742
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,020
Besides, if we give less,

743
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,820
where would

744
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,740
Chief Luo's face be?

745
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,460
Don't make fun of me.

746
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,380
I'm no longer the Chief.

747
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,300
Alright, let's not talk about it.

748
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,100
Aji grew up under my watch.

749
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,220
600 it is.

750
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,540
You two have work to do
this afternoon, right?

751
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,980
Don't even think about it.

752
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,180
There's a pile of things to do.

753
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,780
What else is there?

754
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,360
The incense
in the ancestral hall is gone.

755
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,580
The trees need watering.

756
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,020
Dinner hasn't been prepared.

757
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,700
- Right.
- We need to make potstickers.

758
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,740
