(Zuixian Restaurant)

26
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,400
Today, you invited me over

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,490
not just for a simple welcome party,

28
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,400
right?

29
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,610
Nanfeng, don't worry.

30
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,370
Today,

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,330
we're just here to catch up.

32
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,730
By the way,

33
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,330
I almost forgot to congratulate you.

34
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,670
The Jing Clan has once again won

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,240
the championship of the Tea Contest.

36
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,170
Congratulations.

37
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,400
You flatter me.

38
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,400
I have no merit in this matter.

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,170
Instead, we've taken the spotlight

40
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,170
away from you.

41
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,890
Here, I apologize to you.

42
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,290
Put it down.

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,650
Nanfeng, you're wrong.

44
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,950
How can you say

45
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,830
you have no merit

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,330
in this?

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,620
If it weren't for your revival,

48
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,210
turning around the Jing Clan's fortune,

49
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,280
how could Luo Zhusi, a mere woman,

50
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,960
have accomplished such a great feat?

51
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,770
We can't put it that way.

52
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,520
Now that you're back,

53
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,800
we should definitely

54
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,560
keep in touch.

55
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,280
If you just want

56
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,110
to have tea

57
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,050
or drink with me,

58
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,370
I'm always available.

59
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,070
But if you want

60
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,520
to get close to the Chief

61
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,090
of Jinyu Tea,

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,100
you might be barking up the wrong tree.

63
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,720
The current Chief

64
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,490
is my sister-in-law.

65
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,560
So what?

66
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,840
Isn't it just a matter of time?

67
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,370
However I see it,

68
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,960
Jinyu Tea should rightfully be yours.

69
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,850
Everyone thinks so.

70
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,450
Luo Zhusi

71
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,700
is just a usurper.

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,210
We can't say it like that.

73
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,300
The tribute tea she made

74
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,720
is there for all to see.

75
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,330
I don't want people to gossip

76
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,140
that I took over a plum job

77
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,800
from a woman's hands,

78
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,000
reaping the benefits without effort.

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,490
Even if I were to sit on it,

80
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,170
I wouldn't sit securely, right?

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,180
No wonder we're brothers.

82
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,140
With one heart,

83
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,660
I've already

84
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,860
thought this through for you.

85
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,260
(Jinyu Tea Plantation, Anping Bridge)

86
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,060
- Come on.
- Come on, No. 197.

87
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,340
No. 197.

88
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,460
(Anzhou Sweetie)
This way.

89
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,900
Two liang of Anzhou Sweetie.

90
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,540
Two liang of Anzhou Sweetie.

91
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,860
You have to wait in line.

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,400
- You can come back.
- We'll call you.

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,320
Alright.

94
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,780
What would you like?

95
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,860
- This way.
- How much?

96
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,820
(No. 247)

97
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,380
Two liang of Anzhou Sweetie.

98
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
Line up for shopping.

99
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,200
Come back when you finish.

100
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,060
Ma'am, may I ask

101
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,580
how long I have to wait?

102
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,620
Let me see your number.

103
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,420
No. 240.

104
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,340
You'd better wait outside.

105
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,300
We're too busy here.

106
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,060
I don't want Anzhou Sweetie.

107
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,220
Do you have Aji Tea?

108
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,380
Give me some Aji Tea.

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,640
We don't have Aji Tea here.

110
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,700
Only Anzhou Sweetie.

111
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,060
Anzhou Sweetie is the best.

112
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,720
If you want Aji Tea,

113
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,580
you have to go
to the main store of Jinyu Tea.

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,500
Well, then.

115
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,460
No. 199.

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,700
Two liang of Anzhou Sweetie.

117
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,660
Mine, mine.

118
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,540
So many people.

119
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,900
What would you like?

120
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,920
- Come.
- Anzhou Sweetie.

121
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,900
Alright.

122
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,380
(New: Anzhou Sweetie, limited
to two liang per person per day)

123
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,800
Is there any Anzhou Sweetie?

124
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,280
Sorry, it's sold out for today.

125
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,460
Alright.

126
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,380
Come back in two days.

127
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,340
Alright.

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,700
(New: Anzhou Sweetie, limited
to two liang per person per day)

129
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,820
I'm exhausted.

130
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,020
Jing Kan,

131
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
have you heard?

132
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,860
Everyone is saying

133
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,180
that Luo Aji is
Luo Zhusi's illegitimate child.

134
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,780
You know what?

135
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,740
It's actually possible.

136
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,300
They also say

137
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,620
that Grandfather's death

138
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,340
might have something to do
with Luo Zhusi.

139
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,980
I'm not sure about that.

140
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,740
I also heard

141
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,900
that Luo Zhusi pushed Grandmother

142
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,260
so she fell.

143
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,300
Don't talk nonsense.

144
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,960
She wasn't even home that day.

145
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,620
Come on.

146
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,060
I'm just chatting with you.

147
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,740
I just feel

148
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,380
that it's Uncle who spread these rumors.

149
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,220
Uncle?

150
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
Why?

151
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,140
Think about it.

152
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,320
Before Uncle came back,

153
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,840
there weren't so many rumors about us.

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,860
Ever since he came back,

155
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,240
all kinds of rumors have come out.

156
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,580
And one day,

157
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,940
I saw Uncle go to Luo Zhusi's room.

158
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,860
He came out after a while,

159
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,820
and I saw Luo Zhusi looking haggard.

160
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,040
Don't you think
she's a bit intimidated by Uncle?

161
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,380
Moreover,

162
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,430
after she won the contest,

163
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,840
she's been in low spirits all day.

164
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,760
It's just not normal.

165
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,180
Why are you caring about her now?

166
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,300
It's not really caring.

167
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,940
When I put myself in her shoes,

168
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,480
I think she's also having a tough time.

169
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,020
Alright.

170
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,800
Let's not talk about her anymore.

171
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,720
You must be tired after a whole day.

172
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,180
What do you want for dinner?

173
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
What about a full set?

174
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,290
Forget it.

175
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,500
I can't always have that.

176
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,180
I can't stand it.

177
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,180
I heard the roasted pork trotters

178
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,780
in South Market

179
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,060
are really delicious.

180
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,860
Alright, I want that.

181
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,760
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

182
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,920
How about we split it?

183
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,180
- I can't finish it.
- No way.

184
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,140
No.

185
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,220
Everyone's here.

186
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,700
Mr. An, shall we get started?

187
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,860
Recently,
we've had two pieces of good news.

188
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,500
One is that Jinyu Tea

189
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,260
won the championship of the Tea Contest.

190
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,580
The other is

191
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,980
that my son Nanfeng has returned safely.

192
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,820
According to the old rule,

193
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,940
the Chief of Jinyu Tea

194
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,540
should be continued

195
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,820
by the contest winner.

196
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,580
However, recently,

197
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,820
relatives and local gentry

198
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,540
have been coming to discuss this issue.

199
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,140
I think we should

200
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,940
all sit down and talk

201
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,940
to avoid any future conflicts

202
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,540
in Jinyu Tea.

203
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,060
I think Wei Junyi's actions

204
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,740
have always been fair.

205
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,100
Speaking of which,
Jinyu Tea's success today

206
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
also owes a lot
to the help of all the relatives.

207
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,860
It's good to discuss.

208
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,620
I think we should decide by voting.

209
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,820
One vote for me,

210
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,460
one vote for Mr. An,

211
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,380
one vote for Cousin,

212
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,020
one vote for the first branch,

213
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,480
and one vote for the second branch.

214
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,580
As for me, I'll state my position first.

215
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,220
I support Luo Zhusi

216
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,580
to continue as the Chief of Jinyu Tea.

217
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,740
I agree with Wei Junyi

218
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,140
and highly recognize

219
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,080
Chief Luo's previous contributions
to Jinyu Tea.

220
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,500
Moreover, Wei Junyi's willingness

221
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
to vote for someone
from outside the family

222
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,300
shows her broad-mindedness

223
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,020
and magnanimity.

224
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,100
That's not quite right, Cousin.

225
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,500
Chief Luo is from outside the family,

226
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,740
but she is my daughter-in-law.

227
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,380
She married my son.

228
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
Nanfeng is my son.

229
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,380
Both are my flesh and blood.

230
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,100
That may be so,

231
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,220
but the principle is not like that.

232
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,860
Jing Nanfeng

233
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,860
is Dayou's only son now.

234
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,740
He's also the eldest son.

235
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,220
We thought he had perished,

236
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
so Jinyu Tea had

237
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,860
to be temporarily managed

238
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,620
by Chief Luo.

239
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,380
But now that he's back,

240
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,620
Chief Luo

241
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,340
is no longer legitimately suitable

242
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,300
to be the Chief

243
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,900
of Jinyu Tea.

244
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,020
As the saying goes,

245
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,660
no legitimacy, no authority.

246
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,500
No authority, no success.

247
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,500
Fairness lies in people's hearts.

248
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,060
That makes sense.

249
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,620
The business surely goes to the son.

250
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,540
They're having a discussion.

251
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,860
Don't make a fuss.

252
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,700
I

253
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,500
vote for Jing Kan.

254
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,340
Though Jing Kan didn't win
the Tea Contest,

255
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,220
the Anzhou Sweetie he made

256
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,780
is clearly getting better,

257
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,500
showing a trend of establishing the new.

258
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,100
The future of Jinyu Tea is with him.

259
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,980
He is the future of Jinyu Tea.

260
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,460
Moreover,

261
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,580
he also has the surname Jing.

262
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,200
If you don't vote for him,

263
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,740
who else can you vote for?

264
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,940
Mr. An,

265
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,500
Jing Kan is not within the scope

266
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,140
of our discussion today.

267
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,100
So, we can only choose

268
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,460
between Jing Nanfeng

269
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,420
and Luo Zhusi?

270
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,460
That's right.

271
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,140
I abstain.

272
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,780
Let me say something.

273
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,380
I vote for Chief Luo.

274
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,260
Today, we are here

275
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,740
to choose a chief,

276
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
not to discuss

277
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,780
who Jinyu Tea belongs to.

278
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,460
Jinyu Tea is the lifelong effort

279
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,100
of my parents.

280
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,460
I believe

281
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,780
Chief Luo is more capable

282
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,340
of managing Jinyu Tea than I am.

283
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,460
Thank you all

284
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,780
for your kindness to me.

285
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,580
Please consider

286
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,380
the overall situation of Jinyu Tea.

287
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,100
Thank you.

288
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,620
Chief Luo, what's your opinion?

289
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,460
Mother, Nanfeng, thank you

290
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,660
for your recognition.

291
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,980
But

292
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,820
I've decided to resign

293
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,780
from the position of Chief of Jinyu Tea.

294
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,460
I suggest

295
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,100
Nanfeng

296
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,260
take over as the Chief of Jinyu Tea.

297
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,860
Zhusi,

298
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,460
I can't do this.

299
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,820
Take it.

300
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,340
Zhusi,

301
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,620
this is inappropriate.

302
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,100
Take it.

303
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,340
This...

304
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,980
What do I have to accept

305
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,620
such a heavy responsibility?

306
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,980
Since Chief Luo insists,

307
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,500
although I feel unworthy,

308
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,860
I must

309
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,740
reluctantly accept it.

310
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,220
Alright.

311
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,100
From today on,

312
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,780
I'll officially take over

313
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,620
the position of Chief of Jinyu Tea.

314
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,740
Please rest assured.

315
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,140
I will do my utmost

316
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,220
to promote Jinyu Tea

317
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,500
and live up to your trust.

318
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,060
What do you mean?

319
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,620
Zhusi,

320
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,140
I'd like to help you,

321
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,100
but the origin of Aji

322
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,140
can no longer be kept a secret.

323
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,580
Everyone's been talking about it.

324
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,140
It might reach

325
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,900
Mother's ears sooner or later.

326
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,020
It's better

327
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,840
that I inform Mother first

328
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,020
rather than let others say it.

329
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,460
What do you think?

330
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,340
Do you think I don't know?

331
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,380
You're the one

332
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,500
who spread the news about Aji.

333
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,620
No, I'm not.

334
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,460
You need evidence for that.

335
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,100
Actually, I came here today

336
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,380
to help you.

337
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,140
I have a way

338
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,900
to prevent the fact

339
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,740
that Luo Aji is your illegitimate child

340
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,220
from reaching Mother's ears.

341
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,980
Marry Mr. Wang.

342
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,700
You...

343
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,620
When did you two

344
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,740
collude together?

345
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,380
That's harsh to hear.

346
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,100
As you know,

347
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,900
Liu from the tea plantation

348
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,260
is a sworn brother of Mr. Wang.

349
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,900
I heard from them

350
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,900
that you've had
a tough time these past years.

351
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,500
You've been through a lot.

352
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,500
You should marry someone

353
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,860
to share your burden.

354
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,820
Dream on.

355
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,860
I knew you wouldn't approve of him.

356
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,740
As a family,

357
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,340
I've also prepared

358
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,980
a second option for you.

359
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,140
Hand over the method

360
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,980
of making Aji Tea

361
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,680
and the position of Chief.

362
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,820
As you know,

363
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,940
these things

364
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,620
should've been mine.

365
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,020
If you don't want to hand them over,

366
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,700
that's fine.

367
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,980
I'll think of other ways

368
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,980
to help you.

369
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,540
Madam,

370
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,380
you've worked

371
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,740
in the shop all day.

372
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,740
Let me help you back to your room.

373
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,020
There will probably be

374
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,860
no peace in the Jing Clan anymore.

375
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,580
I don't think Jing Nanfeng

376
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,220
will just let it go.

377
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,540
He's holding this over our heads,

378
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,780
and he might blackmail us
for the rest of our lives.

379
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,580
As long as he doesn't let Aji know,

380
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,700
I don't care about the rest.

381
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,220
Why didn't he die on that island?

382
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,620
The heavens must be blind.

383
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,460
And I didn't expect Wang

384
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,940
to get involved with him.

385
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,860
I've ended things with him.

386
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,700
Madam,

387
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,300
I know I'm not good with words,

388
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,880
but I've been thinking
about it for days.

389
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,380
I still want to bring this up.

390
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,860
Let's tell Young Master Aji

391
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,420
about this.

392
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,180
Once we tell him,

393
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,940
there's no turning back.

394
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,540
But if someone has

395
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,780
to tell Aji the truth,

396
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,020
you're the most suitable one.

397
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,780
Come on.

398
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,420
Eat this.

399
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,380
Alright.

400
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,580
- Uncle.
- You're dining.

401
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,450
Uncle, you're back.

402
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,420
Aren't you not coming back to eat?

403
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,460
Food outside

404
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,940
can't compare to food at home.

405
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,820
Besides, those are social events.

406
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,460
I might as well not go.

407
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,140
Master Nanfeng.

408
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,020
Good, thank you.

409
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
I came over today

410
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,020
to announce something.

411
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,140
Uncle, please go ahead.

412
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,120
Each branch already gets

413
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,580
a share of the shops, right?

414
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,380
After I became the Chief,

415
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,960
I realized that the distribution

416
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,780
of some shops is not reasonable.

417
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,320
We need to unify the accounts,

418
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,000
and it's also very troublesome

419
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,480
for the tea plantation.

420
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,780
It's labor-intensive, time-consuming
and requires a lot of manpower.

421
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,520
You might think it's just a small thing,

422
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,860
but when added together,

423
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,180
it's a considerable expense.

424
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,060
So, I've decided

425
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,460
to bring all these shops together

426
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,980
and operate them uniformly.

427
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,860
We need to save where we can,

428
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,700
right?

429
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,660
Uncle,

430
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,660
are you targeting us?

431
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,220
How could I?

432
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,140
You've had the first branch's shops.

433
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,180
Chief Luo's shop

434
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,500
is now under your management, too.

435
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,940
Jinyu Tea now only has

436
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,100
the Anping Bridge Shop left.

437
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,740
Yes, Uncle.

438
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,900
Why beat around the bush?

439
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,940
If you want our shop,

440
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
just say so.

441
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,380
Sixi.

442
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,460
The reason why I said that

443
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,860
is to avoid hurting the family harmony.

444
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
Uncle,

445
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,320
by taking it back like this,

446
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,060
aren't you afraid

447
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,220
of hurting the harmony?

448
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,140
This is

449
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,060
just not fair.

450
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,320
Jinyu Tea didn't have
the Anping Bridge Shop before.

451
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,100
Jing Kan built the Anping Bridge Shop

452
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,240
painstakingly, step by step,

453
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,680
to what it is today.

454
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,460
Sixi,

455
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,820
since you put it that way,

456
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,580
I'll be straightforward with you.

457
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,180
Is the Anping Bridge Shop

458
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,700
under Jinyu Tea's brand?

459
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,380
Fine, Uncle.

460
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,580
I'll be straightforward, too.

461
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,020
I'll answer on behalf of Jing Kan.

462
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,360
From today on, our shop

463
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,660
won't be using Jinyu Tea's brand.

464
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Sixi.

465
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,700
Even so, does that mean

466
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,760
it's not our family's business anymore?

467
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,380
I think Sixi is right.

468
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,740
They work so hard

469
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
to open a shop,

470
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,300
and you want to just take it back?

471
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,620
Who do you think you are?

472
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm your father.

473
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,140
Here's the thing.

474
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,220
Jing Kan,

475
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,660
I came over today

476
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,780
to discuss this

477
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,060
with everyone

478
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,140
in a friendly way.

479
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,700
But I really didn't expect

480
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,220
that in your eyes,

481
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,900
there is no family at all.

482
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,780
Uncle, you can't say that.

483
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,780
You don't represent the family.

484
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,200
Don't blindly make yourself

485
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,680
the authority of the family.

486
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,580
We're not disregarding the family.

487
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,380
We're mainly disregarding you.

488
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,820
Did I make myself clear?

489
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,160
You don't want to talk things over?

490
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
It's not about that.

491
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,580
It's about whether you can

492
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,780
accept it.

493
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,940
I'm done. Let's go.

494
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,780
Sixi,

495
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,100
do you know there are rules

496
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,180
in this family?

497
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,840
Sixi doesn't need to know

498
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,800
so many rules.

499
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,420
Chief Jing,

500
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,460
farewell.

501
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,620
Let's go.

502
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,660
Let's eat.

503
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,700
Eat.

504
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,060
Madam,

505
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,900
I've had Mingyue

506
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,100
stand at the entrance.

507
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,060
She'll report if anyone comes in.

508
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,300
Aji.

509
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,460
Hurry.

510
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Are you hungry?

511
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,940
Have some snacks.

512
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,300
They were just made.

513
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,500
Have some tea.

514
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,660
Come on, sit down.

515
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,160
- Auntie.
- Sit.

516
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,900
What's the matter?

517
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,980
Sit down.

518
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,420
Sit, come on.

519
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,300
Come and eat.

520
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,180
Have this cake.

521
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,260
Aji,

522
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,140
how old are you this year?

523
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,940
26.

524
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,940
26 years,

525
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,300
3 months,

526
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,860
and 15 days.

527
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,380
Auntie, you remember

528
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,380
quite clearly.

529
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,540
There are some things

530
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,580
I wanted you

531
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,100
to never know forever,

532
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,620
but it's unavoidable now.

533
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,580
I wrote to your mother

534
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,060
the other day,

535
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,420
and she agreed.

536
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,900
27 years ago,

537
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,020
I was still an unmarried young lady.

538
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,460
I was deceived

539
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,940
by a servant

540
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,300
and fell pregnant.

541
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,300
I thought

542
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,700
we were in love,

543
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,380
and he promised

544
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,140
to run away with me.

545
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,580
But later I found out

546
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,300
that he was just trying to pacify me,

547
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,420
and he ran away secretly.

548
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,860
When my father found out,

549
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,620
he was furious.

550
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,300
He called in a physician

551
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,860
to abort the child in my womb.

552
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,940
I would rather die than agree.

553
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
Coincidentally,

554
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,140
my sister-in-law was also pregnant.

555
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,460
To preserve

556
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,020
the reputation of the Luo Clan

557
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,180
and the child in my womb,

558
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,380
my brother falsely claimed

559
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,620
that my sister-in-law

560
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,220
gave birth to twins.

561
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,500
Auntie.

562
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
This joke is not funny at all.

563
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,060
Did my mother

564
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,020
bring my sister here?

565
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,400
And they asked you
to play a trick on me?

566
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,620
Aji,

567
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,780
you're not young anymore.

568
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,140
I would rather

569
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,020
bear all the pain

570
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,780
by myself,

571
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,420
but now,

572
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,340
I have to tell you.

573
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
Yes.

574
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,140
The child in my womb back then

575
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,100
was you.

576
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,380
Why are you telling me this?

577
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,140
- I...
- You're lying, right?

578
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,380
You're lying, right?

579
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,020
Aji.

580
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,540
Are you lying to me?

581
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,620
- Aji.
- You're lying.

582
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,020
(Endless Joy)

583
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,180
Wine.

584
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,140
Fill it up.

585
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,460
Come on.

586
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,780
Wait, wait.

587
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,100
- I'll pour for you.
- Nanfeng.

588
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,060
Sit down.

589
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,100
Take your seat.

590
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,020
Let me explain.

591
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,820
I'd like to drink,

592
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,380
but I haven't won all night.

593
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,700
Chief Tan,

594
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,380
you're spoiling the fun.

595
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,020
This is not spoiling the fun.

596
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,620
We three men

597
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,460
playing guessing games

598
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,380
isn't very interesting.

599
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,740
Yeah.

600
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,580
Today, we finally

601
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,500
got together,

602
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,620
and we're in a good mood.

603
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,220
How about we roll the dice?

604
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,860
I'm not gambling anymore.

605
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,180
This isn't gambling.

606
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,020
We don't have enough people.

607
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,860
Play with us.

608
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,760
Yeah.

609
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,260
You've put the Chief's seal

610
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,620
in your pocket.

611
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,700
Just play with us.

612
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,780
Who'd dare say anything to you?

613
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,260
- Right.
- Play with us.

614
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,270
- Play with us.
- Yes.

615
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,280
Come on, come on.

616
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,220
Look.

617
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,780
Everyone wants you to.

618
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,540
Waiter, bring the dice.

619
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,140
Alright.

620
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,300
Listen.

621
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,140
Just one round.

622
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,380
Not betting big.

623
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,060
Just for fun.

624
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,220
Alright.

625
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,120
Just one round.

626
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,140
- Okay.
- Just one round.

627
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,050
- Okay.
- Come on.

628
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,900
Open.

629
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,260
Open.

630
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,460
Three, five, six. Big.

631
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,420
Open.

632
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,700
Three sixes.

633
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,140
A triple. The winner takes it all.

634
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,620
Impressive, impressive.

635
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,700
Chief Tan.

636
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,820
I'm sorry.

637
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,700
Nanfeng,

638
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,020
luckily, you said to play small,

639
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,140
otherwise

640
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,100
I would have lost big.

641
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,340
Look, what did I say?

642
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,380
The current Chief Jing

643
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,620
is really blessed.

644
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,380
Nanfeng,

645
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,620
among us brothers,

646
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,540
it's all about keeping

647
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,460
our word.

648
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,020
So, shouldn't you also

649
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,020
let me know the method

650
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,100
of making Aji Tea

651
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,540
and Anzhou Sweetie

652
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,860
as you promised before?

653
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,420
Chief Tan,

654
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,540
when I do things,

655
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,020
it's all about trust.

656
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
But as you know,

657
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,860
this matter

658
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,780
is not that easy.

659
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,860
It can't be fast.

660
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,580
It shouldn't be fast.

661
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,100
If it's too fast,

662
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,700
it will cause suspicion, right?

663
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,860
So, you mean...?

664
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,220
Rest assured.

665
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,620
I will definitely give you

666
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,620
the method of making Aji Tea.

667
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,620
Put your mind

668
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,940
at ease.

669
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Thank you, Chief Jing.

670
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,060
Share it.

671
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,340
We've had enough to drink today.

672
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,540
Let's

673
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,580
call it a night.

674
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,380
Get out.

675
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,380
Get lost!

676
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,620
I've always treated him with courtesy.

677
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,300
If Jing Nanfeng

678
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,900
dares

679
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,780
to betray me,

680
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,060
don't blame me

681
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,540
later.

682
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,020
Come on.

683
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,980
Blame you for what?

684
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,620
Do whatever you want.

685
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,220
I support you.

686
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,220
Zhenzhu.

687
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,620
Donglin bought pork knuckles for you.

688
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,140
He even peeled the lotus seeds for you.

689
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,260
Try some.

690
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,340
Would you like some lotus seeds?

691
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,460
Mother,

692
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,620
tell him not to send food anymore.

693
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,660
Zhenzhu,

694
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,180
we've all seen

695
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,020
how Donglin

696
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,980
has been

697
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,140
treating you lately.

698
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,980
You can't keep

699
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,300
avoiding him, right?

700
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,700
Originally,

701
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,220
I thought Donglin

702
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,900
was just after our family's property

703
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,580
when he became a matrilocal husband.

704
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,340
But after this time,

705
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,300
I realized

706
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,620
that I can't even do

707
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,220
some of the things he does.

708
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,140
If you don't want someone

709
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,300
like him in this life,

710
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,300
then who do you want?

711
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,260
By the way, Mother,

712
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,500
do you think

713
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,180
Jing Nanfeng

714
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,380
has really changed for the better?

715
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,820
He

716
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,820
has indeed changed a bit.

717
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,340
After all, we're family.

718
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,980
Isn't it good

719
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,740
to live together harmoniously?

720
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,140
I'm not drunk.

721
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,060
You...

722
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,060
Help me up, go.

723
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,820
Zhenzhu,

724
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,820
you're here, too.

725
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,940
Let me take a look.

726
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,580
You're drunk.

727
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,780
Zhenzhu, go back to your room.

728
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,900
You've gained weight.

729
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,500
Stop right there.

730
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,060
Why are you avoiding me?

731
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,700
I told her to go back.

732
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,460
You,

733
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,780
go make me a bowl

734
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,140
of osmanthus and lotus seed congee.

735
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,660
- Fine.
- I'm hungry.

736
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,740
I know.

737
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,140
Who are you bossing around?

738
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,140
Is my mother the maid

739
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,060
you married?

740
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,300
What gives you the right to yell at her?

741
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,140
You've got some temper.

742
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,540
What do you mean by yelling?

743
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,140
I'll speak more softly

744
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,460
in the future, okay?

745
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,340
Lower your voice,

746
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,900
will you?

747
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,060
Why are you two looking at me like that?

748
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,500
Am I that terrifying?

749
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,940
I'll change, dear.

750
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,420
- I know.
- I've changed.

751
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,260
I know, I know.

752
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,140
Go back to your room.

753
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,100
You have to trust me, right?

754
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,020
I trust you.

755
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,420
I trust you.

756
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,380
Trust me.

757
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,460
Go back to your room. I trust you.

758
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,180
Trust me. I've changed.
