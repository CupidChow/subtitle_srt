25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,990
Your pastry shop

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,160
has been quite famous.

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,030
Even people from Anning Prefecture

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,190
come to buy it.

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,390
It'll soon become a local specialty.

30
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,570
You flatter me, Chief Ge.

31
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,110
Actually, since you

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,320
took over Ruicao Tea,

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
its business

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
has been flourishing.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,680
You flatter me.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,830
I've heard

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,390
you will open three new shops

38
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,840
in Songxi County.

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,210
Laolongtan Tea has closed down.

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,400
In Taiping County,

41
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,960
only your clan and my clan

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,680
still sell the tea.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,960
But anyway,

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,180
Tan Long was

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,560
really ruthless.

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,090
Because of him, Jing Kan...

47
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,860
I've heard

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,270
Magistrate Meng and Advisor Xia

49
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,240
also fell from power.

50
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,210
You don't know yet, huh?

51
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,990
Tan Long and Mr. Jing

52
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,490
accused each other in prison

53
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,610
and got them into trouble.

54
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,110
They oppressed tea farmers

55
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,120
and confiscated tribute tea.

56
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,370
They deserved that.

57
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,490
Yeah.

58
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,050
How's Sixi doing lately?

59
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,840
You know her?

60
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,960
She and I met once.

61
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,560
I've heard her tea shop

62
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,110
will have a branch soon.

63
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,050
Yes.

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,400
I didn't know

65
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,350
Sixi could be

66
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,400
as capable as Ms. Luo.

67
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,790
She does

68
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,890
even better than her mother-in-law.

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,510
Women in your family

70
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,830
are all strong.

71
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,770
Yes, yes.

72
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,280
It's getting late.

73
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,490
I should go home.

74
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,770
All right.

75
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,790
On the opening day,

76
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,210
I'll be there to congratulate.

77
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,400
See you.

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,740
(Jing Residence)

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,350
Mother,

80
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,930
you aren't what you used to be.

81
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,140
We should save money.

82
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,420
I'm not being fussy anymore.

83
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,300
And I've realized

84
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,220
this kind of life feels better.

85
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,220
You've changed, too.

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,420
Mother,

87
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,740
why did you come to me

88
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,820
so late?

89
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,980
I...

90
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,700
I'm here to thank you.

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,660
Look.

92
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,900
You need money

93
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,860
for every aspect of life

94
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,380
but still think of Aji and me.

95
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,900
Mother,

96
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,300
I have an idea.

97
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,220
We will open a new shop

98
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,860
very soon.

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,740
We need a manager.

100
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,540
You're capable enough

101
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,940
to manage

102
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,060
a few more shops.

103
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,780
I want to hire Aji

104
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,500
as the chief manager of our branch.

105
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,060
One more request.

106
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,860
We want you to be the deputy chief.

107
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,180
A... Aji...

108
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,940
I'm afraid he won't agree.

109
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,060
He and I had a deal.

110
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,820
Then, I'll go assist him.

111
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,940
Anyway, Sixi,

112
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,740
thank you so much.

113
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,260
Don't say that, Mother.

114
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,460
We're a family.

115
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,700
Let's not talk about this.

116
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,820
Have some tea.

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,420
It's nearly over-brewed.

118
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,020
Oh, wow.

119
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,220
We haven't had a lively day for long.

120
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,180
Indeed.

121
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,100
Sixi.

122
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,140
If my husband hadn't...

124
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,980
Auntie,

125
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,380
it has nothing to do with you.

126
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,340
Don't think too much.

127
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,540
That's right.

128
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,500
Tomorrow, Aji

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,620
will have his wedding.

130
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
We should be happy.

131
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,060
That's right. Be happy.

132
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,180
I'm sure it'll taste great.

133
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,780
Then I'll take them

134
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,380
- to the kitchen.
- All right.

135
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,260
You stay here.

136
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,220
All right.

137
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,020
Sixi.

138
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,060
If you feel sad,

139
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,420
come to me and cry.

140
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,700
I'll always be there.

141
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,140
All right.

142
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,660
Smile.

143
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,940
Oh no. It looks awful.

144
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,260
Smile happily.

145
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,660
That's right.

146
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,460
All right.

147
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,500
Oh no.

148
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,460
Ms. Xue.

149
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,300
It's been a long time,

150
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,380
but she's still offensive.

151
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,220
Sixi, who do you mean?

152
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,620
You exactly know.

153
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,380
I didn't offend you.

154
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,500
Come on, do some work.

155
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,480
- Here.
- What do I do?

156
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,340
Put this in.

157
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,360
Sixi.

158
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,780
Sixi.

159
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Look who's back.

160
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,660
Sixi.

161
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,780
No. 357.

162
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,340
Ruan Ling.

163
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,780
Shuangxi.

164
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,140
I missed you so much.

165
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,260
So did I.

166
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,220
You're back.

167
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,100
This is way too coincidental.

168
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,940
Tomorrow, it's the wedding
for Aji and Wan'er.

169
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,820
Really? What a coincidence!

170
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,700
And you are...?

171
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,340
Guiwei.

172
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,260
Ruan.

173
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,380
Why are you wearing my...?

174
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,140
I... I thought you had discarded

175
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,100
this suit.

176
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,340
Guiwei,

177
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,420
from your outfit,

178
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,500
I can see

179
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,740
you'll be professional soon.

180
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,220
Ruan,

181
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,100
look over here.

182
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,060
Guiwei, you're professional now.

183
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,860
I just learned it from you.

184
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,060
You're totally professional.

185
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,260
Look how happy Ruan Ling is.

186
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,460
When your trip is over,

187
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,790
will you get married soon?

188
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,660
Yes.

189
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,420
After this trip,

190
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,020
- we've decided...
- We'll break up.

191
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,460
What?

192
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,700
Why?

193
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,860
No reason.

194
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,940
We are not right for each other.

195
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,220
Here it goes again.

196
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
Sixi, you know what?

197
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,820
Every morning, after someone got washed,

198
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,740
her rouge,

199
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
her jewelry, and her comb

200
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,020
were almost everywhere.

201
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,620
I cleaned them up a million times.

202
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,340
She still didn't put things back

203
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,940
after using them.

204
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,980
Sixi, I'll just say one thing.

205
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,820
I don't put things back where they were,

206
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,740
so what?

207
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,580
Don't you feel awful?

208
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Can you imagine
how dilatory this guy was?

209
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,460
It was so late

210
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,620
when we arrived at the inn.

211
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,980
But he didn't go to bed

212
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,940
until he finished

213
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,860
cleaning everything.

214
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,860
I was just being neat.

215
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,060
And that kind of bed...

216
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,340
So dirty. If I hadn't cleaned it,

217
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,700
wouldn't you feel disgusted?

218
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,740
No. I was just tired.

219
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,180
And now, he's fond of teaching me.

220
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,500
I was trying to complain to him

221
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
and chat a little.

222
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,380
Then, he started

223
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,820
to nag all the time

224
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,860
and give me a lecture.

225
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,020
Did I need that?

226
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,580
You could stop chatting with me.

227
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,780
Who else could I chat with?

228
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,660
Away from home, did I know anybody?

229
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
All right. If you say so,

230
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,620
I'll go to another man.

231
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,900
- No problem.
- See?

232
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,300
Every time she replies like that.

233
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,540
We can't communicate at all.

234
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,660
She's out of her mind.

235
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,340
I shouldn't have gone with you.

236
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
I should have ended this trip early.

237
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,260
Why didn't you return?

238
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,500
Because of Jing Kan.

239
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,650
He asked me to introduce

240
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
Anzhou Sweetie everywhere.

241
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,460
I did that for him.

242
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,500
You must be insane.

243
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,500
Sixi, I'm sorry.

244
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,780
I mean...

245
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,300
Come on. It's all right.

246
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,140
Don't bother.

247
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,500
Go on with the fight. I'm fine.

248
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,580
We'll stop arguing.

249
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,900
Let's go tidy up our room.

250
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
It isn't cleaned yet.

251
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,300
- Sure.
- We'll go clean it.

252
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,140
- All right.
- Yeah.

253
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,100
Let's go.

254
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,460
Sixi,

255
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,340
if you are sad,

256
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,740
cry out if you want.

257
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,380
You can wet my clothes.

258
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,100
I want to kill you.

259
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,020
Are you being too idle?

260
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,620
Do I even look sad?

261
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,900
- I'll go.
- You tell me

262
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,780
how I should be happy.

263
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,620
Show it to me! Do I look happy now?

264
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,540
You're just too idle!

265
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,460
Go get some work!

266
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,580
How annoying!

267
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,900
Mothers,

268
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
there will be a wedding.

269
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,100
Here's some joy for you.

270
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,460
We made these sweet dumplings.

271
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,420
I know you like drinking.

272
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,620
Here's some wine, too.

273
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,180
Here.

274
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,100
Mother, you have some, too.

275
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,780
(Tomb of Mother Qin Baoyi)

276
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,500
Mother,

277
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,980
how have you been in there?

278
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,740
I guess

279
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,660
the two of you

280
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,620
can be close friends.

281
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,500
Everything is fine with us.

282
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,980
Zhenzhu is pregnant.

283
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,260
We want the baby's nickname

284
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,220
to be Little Bracelet.

285
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,900
Donglin's pastry shop

286
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,860
is flourishing, too.

287
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,100
Everybody sees him

288
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,340
and respects him.

289
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,620
Ruan Ling and Shuangxi

290
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,100
are back from their trip.

291
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,660
They bicker all the time.

292
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,260
But I don't think they'll break up.

293
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,900
Our seniors

294
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,140
are also in good health.

295
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,260
Don't worry about them.

296
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,900
Youming Tea Shop will have a branch.

297
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,980
I...

298
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,820
I'm doing well, too.

299
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,500
Now, I can distinguish
dozens of types of tea trees.

300
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Surprised, huh?

301
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,500
I also know
why Banfang Tea tastes so good.

302
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,020
(Tomb of Mother Qin Baoyi)

303
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,740
Mother,

304
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm doing really well.

305
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,140
I've protected this family.

306
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,500
They say I'm very strong.

307
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,980
I've never cried.

308
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,780
Who would let people see her crying?

309
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,580
At night, I usually cry alone.

310
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,340
Mother,

311
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,780
where do you think

312
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,500
Jing Kan is?

313
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,220
Sometimes, I'm really scared.

314
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,740
I fear

315
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,320
that I can't get him back.

316
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,620
(Tomb of Mother Mai Youyou)

317
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,340
If...

318
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,620
I mean if...

319
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,660
If you don't see him

320
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,140
in your world,

321
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,340
can you give me a hint?

322
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,100
Just a little hint.

323
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,380
Sixi, when are we going back?

324
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,980
It's so hot in the sun.

325
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Guiwei, come over here.

326
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,100
Come over.

327
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,820
Why, Sixi?

328
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,220
Too hot, huh?

329
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,580
Why did you hit me?

330
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,740
Sorry. I was impulsive.

331
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,500
Get me up.

332
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,580
Come on.

333
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,020
Don't hit me again.

334
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,980
I won't.

335
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,860
I'll hit you really hard.

336
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,040
Why do you hit me again?

337
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,900
What did I do?

338
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,980
Come back. Don't run.

339
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,140
I'm not going there.

340
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,980
Look at your boots.

341
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,780
You can't run too far.

342
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,700
Come back here.

343
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,500
Auntie, look. She's hitting me again.

344
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,260
Come over here, Guiwei.

345
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,860
Don't push me.

346
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,300
(Wedding)

347
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,060
Father.

348
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,500
Mother.

349
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,700
Please have some tea.

350
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,500
Father and Mother,

351
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,580
have some tea.

352
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,140
Wan'er, you're finally married.

353
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,620
Thank you, Father.

354
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,620
Father,

355
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,100
Mother,

356
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,780
have some tea.

357
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,300
Father.

358
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,260
Mother,

359
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,020
have some tea.

360
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,220
All right.

361
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,180
Here.

362
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,780
Mother,

363
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,300
please have some tea.

364
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,020
Mother.

365
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,580
Have some tea.

366
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,900
Here.

367
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,580
Blessings to you.

368
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,620
Thank you, Mother.

369
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,740
Thank you, Mother.

370
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,460
Grandmother,

371
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,980
please have some tea.

372
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,580
Auntie, please have some tea.

373
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,820
All right.

374
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,500
Blessings to you.

375
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,140
Good.

376
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,380
It's thoughtful of you.

377
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,300
You use Anzhou Sweetie

378
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,780
for your wedding.

379
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,340
Anzhou Sweetie?

380
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,100
This isn't Anzhou Sweetie.

381
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,500
We brought it here

382
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,420
from Jiangtou Prefecture.

383
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,140
Jiangtou Prefecture?

384
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,100
No.

385
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,780
This is Anzhou Sweetie.

386
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,700
Kan asked Ruan

387
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,980
to spread it everywhere.

388
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,180
So, it's available

389
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,140
in other places.

390
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,740
But...

391
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,140
We didn't go to Jiangtou Prefecture.

392
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,580
What's the name of this tea?

393
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,380
It's Yueji Tea.

394
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,020
Yueji Tea?

395
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,500
If you were me,

396
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,820
what name would you have?

397
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,620
Why would I...?

398
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,860
I'll think of a name
that also sounds nice.

399
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,060
Wait a minute. Let me think.

400
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,460
Yueji Tea.

401
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,700
Yueji Tea?

402
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,140
My old inn

403
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,420
was Yueji Inn.

404
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,260
And I often say,
"Ai Sixi loves herself."

405
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,820
Yueji means "love oneself".

406
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,380
Do you know

407
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,420
where the tea-maker is?

408
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,620
In a house by the river

409
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,820
of Jiuli County, Jiangtou Prefecture.

410
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,460
Sixi.

411
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,780
- She...
- Sixi.

412
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Sixi!

413
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,550
Move, move.

414
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,580
Come on, let's go.

415
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,700
Carry this, please. Thank you.

416
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,860
Wait, My Lady.

417
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,060
Sorry, sorry.

418
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,220
Wish you a happy wedding

419
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,060
and everlasting love.

420
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,100
- We're in a hurry.
- Sixi.

421
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,060
We have to go.

422
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,580
- Sixi.
- Slow down, My Lady.

423
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,220
(Jing Kan,)

424
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,660
(it has to be you.)

425
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,420
(Nobody but you.)

426
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,980
Jing Kan.

427
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,860
Who are you?

428
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,980
When did you get in here?

429
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,740
Sorry, wrong place.

430
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,580
Master, the tea leaves are almost done.

431
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,460
Shall I get them out?

432
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,420
Yes.

433
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,500
All right.

434
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,140
Jing Kan.

435
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,180
You really are alive.

436
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,820
I knew you could be alive.

437
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,340
Wait, wait.

438
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,420
Who are you?

439
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,260
You look somewhat familiar.

440
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,060
My master

441
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
has a poor memory.

442
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,300
Poor memory?

443
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,380
Yes.

444
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,660
When I resuscitated him

445
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,740
by the river,

446
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,980
he didn't remember anything.

447
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,260
But he remembers how to make tea.

448
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,700
You know each other?

449
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,660
No.

450
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,380
You call this "poor memory"?

451
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,220
Jing Kan.

452
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,340
I'm your wife.

453
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,620
Ma'am,

454
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,940
behave yourself.

455
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,820
Honey, who is she?

456
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,940
Sweetheart.

457
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,900
She said she was Master's wife.

458
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,820
Come on.

459
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,540
Why did you come out just like that?

460
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,620
Come on. Let's get back in.

461
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,060
Will you buy some tea?

462
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,100
Jing Kan.

463
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,180
You're Jing Kan.

464
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,580
I'm your wife.

465
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,300
You're my husband.

466
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,700
You're the eldest child

467
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,860
of a family of tribute tea.

468
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,860
Your master

469
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,300
is Master Tea-gold.

470
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,900
You remade your parents' Banfang Tea.

471
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,340
You even made some new tea.

472
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,780
This is it, Anzhou Sweetie.

473
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,780
You're neat.

474
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,820
You're terrified of pain.

475
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,020
You soak your feet in scalding water.

476
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,860
But I often ask you

477
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,060
to use cold water with me.

478
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,380
You're very knowledgeable.

479
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,740
You even published a poetry book.

480
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,380
You have many talented friends.

481
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,860
But I can't even learn to write

482
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,820
when you taught me.

483
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,620
Sometimes, you brag too much.

484
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,580
But you're righteous and kind.

485
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,060
Oh.

486
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,500
You care a lot about tea farmers.

487
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,420
You asked Ruan Ling

488
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,500
to promote the pan-firing

489
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,580
of Anzhou Sweetie.

490
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,740
You make Taiping County

491
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,980
no longer the center for tribute tea.

492
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,100
Don't you remember?

493
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,180
You're Chubby?

494
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,540
Yes. I'm Chubby.

495
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,980
You're Handsome.

496
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,300
Your master gave us these nicknames.

497
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,940
Chubby.

498
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,260
Handsome.

499
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,900
Where's Pretty?

500
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,580
I really want to punch you.

501
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,860
She's at home with her grandfather.

502
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,340
But it doesn't matter.

503
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,180
The point is, I'm your wife,

504
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,820
Ai Sixi.

505
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,980
Gentleman.

506
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,580
You're Sixi?

507
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,660
Yes. I'm Sixi.

508
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,790
Sixi.

509
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,500
You remember?

510
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,580
You remember now.

511
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,500
I had a hard time looking for you,

512
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Jing Kan.

513
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,420
I really, really missed you.

514
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,300
- Kan.
- Jing Kan.

515
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,220
Kan.

516
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,180
Jing Kan.

517
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,620
Will you buy some tea?

518
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,980
He has lost his memories.

519
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,100
Give him some time.

520
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,460
Jing Kan,

521
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,940
it's me.

522
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,980
I'm Ruan Ling.

523
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,300
Don't you even remember me?

524
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,460
Ruan Ling?

525
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,700
Well, say something unforgettable

526
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,740
between you.

527
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,100
That's right. Say it.

528
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,860
Do you remember

529
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,820
you asked someone to feed me

530
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,620
seventeen and a half bowls of rice?

531
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,860
Who could be that wicked?

532
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,740
You...

533
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,260
Umm...

534
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,180
You don't even remember that?

535
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,740
You...

536
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,340
- Jing Kan.
- Jing Kan.

537
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,060
You're alive.

538
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,380
This is great.

539
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,340
You're still alive.

540
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,660
Kan, this is awesome.

541
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,620
Grandmother.

542
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,300
He has lost his memories.

543
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,380
Lost his memories?

544
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,860
How did that happen?

545
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,020
Kan.

546
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm your grandmother.

547
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,540
Grandmother and Auntie,

548
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,740
give him some time.

549
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,820
That's right.

550
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,140
- Yeah.
- Glad he's here.

551
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,420
He'll recover.

552
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,860
Glad you're alive.

553
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,380
He'll slowly recover.

554
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,340
Jing Kan.

555
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,460
Luo Zhusi?

556
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,860
- You're fine?
- He can remember.

557
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,100
- He can remember.
- Awesome.

558
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,340
- You can remember.
- He's fine.

559
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,620
I can remember.

560
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,580
He can remember now.

561
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,100
What do you want? I'll help.

562
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,260
I'm going to kill you!

563
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,180
Run!

564
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,140
Jing Kan!

565
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,100
Jing Kan, where are you going?

566
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,580
It's all right.

567
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,100
Indeed, hatred lasts longer than love.

568
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,020
It's all right.

569
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,820
Be careful, My Lady.

570
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,740
Be very careful.

571
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,620
(The end)

572
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,580
(Jinyu Tea)

573
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,300
