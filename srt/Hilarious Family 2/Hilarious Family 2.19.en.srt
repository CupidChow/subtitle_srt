Xiaoyu,

26
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,770
take this money for now.

27
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,090
I might not be able
to come often recently.

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,890
Be sparing with it.

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,370
You don't know
how tough it's been for me.

30
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you want to hear
how tough it's been for me?

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,800
Go on.

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,390
We just opened

33
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,720
a pastry shop together.

34
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,950
(Careful Pastry)
Is it necessary for us

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,730
to act like we are

36
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,820
having an affair every day?

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,860
You know very well.

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,900
If Zhenzhu finds out

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,960
that I'm running
a small business outside...

40
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,770
We have to be extra careful.

41
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,770
Help me out.

42
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,120
I don't get it.

43
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,230
Isn't doing business a good thing?

44
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,490
Why can't you get it?

45
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm a matrilocal husband.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,280
Making money behind her back

47
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,400
is punishable by death.

48
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,210
Why don't you just tell her?

49
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,210
If I tell her,

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,540
would there even be a share for me?

51
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,900
If you won't sell, I'm leaving.

52
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,010
I can't do this.

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm really leaving.

54
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,270
I really can't.

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,820
I still need to buy a few more things.

56
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,510
I'll sort it out and let you know.

57
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,230
Hurry up. Don't delay the opening.

58
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,120
We need more things?

59
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,520
Of course.

60
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,340
Do you think opening a shop
is that easy?

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,280
But 200 wen for this?

62
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,400
It's too expensive.

63
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,880
But it's an imitation of a bracelet

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,190
worth 200 taels of silver.

65
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,580
It's about 20 taels of silver.

66
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,110
- Twenty?
- Twenty.

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,050
This won't do.

68
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,170
Where else can I scrape some money?

69
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,770
Scrape?

70
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,730
Lin Donglin?

71
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,290
Scrape?

72
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,120
Sometimes,

73
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,770
(Careful Pastry)
I really admire you.

74
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,460
(Careful Pastry)

75
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,050
Did I see it wrong?

76
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,450
Jiao'e,

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,210
you look really pretty today.

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,260
When don't I look pretty?

79
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,200
Yes, yes.

80
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,600
Where are you going?

81
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,900
Mother asked me to deliver
shark fin soup to Grandmother.

82
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,770
Where did you buy this?

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
What?

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,720
It looks quite nice.

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,590
Is it tasty?

86
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,470
Go buy it yourself.

87
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,310
No, I just...

88
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,360
Let me...

89
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,930
Don't touch.

90
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,840
I'm just asking where you bought it.

91
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,710
What for?

92
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,890
Why are you so stingy?

93
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,050
Move aside.

94
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,970
What are you two doing?

95
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,820
Nothing, dear.

96
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm just chatting with Jiao'e.

97
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,510
Hurry up.

98
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,520
The dishes will get cold.

99
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,420
Yes, yes.

100
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,360
Yes, dear.

101
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,970
I'll go first.

102
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,840
Lin Donglin,

103
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,520
why did you go

104
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,250
to the South Market this morning?

105
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,500
What are you talking about,

106
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,440
Jiao'e?

107
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,250
I saw you this morning

108
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,060
at the entrance

109
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,000
of Sining House,

110
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,550
intimate with a woman.

111
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,940
You can't just make things up.

112
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,990
What woman?

113
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,910
You must have

114
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,360
mistaken someone else for me.

115
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,060
Dear.

116
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,650
Alright, I'll go right now.

117
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,350
I have to go, or Zhenzhu will get mad.

118
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,520
Could you deliver it for me?

119
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,210
Don't make things up.

120
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,360
I wasn't sure before.

121
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,480
Lin Donglin,

122
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,280
you're a matrilocal husband.

123
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,040
How dare you have an affair!

124
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,920
I'll surely deal with you.

125
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,290
Look at this.

126
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,330
Only 50 wen

127
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,400
for so many green plums.

128
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
Where did you find them?

129
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,210
I look for the cheapest ones.

130
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,010
Miss, if you're not satisfied,

131
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,260
you can pay a little more.

132
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,280
What do you mean?

133
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,790
If there's nothing wrong

134
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,790
with these,

135
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,160
why are they so cheap?

136
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,620
Come on. I ran into a fraud before.

137
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,450
All the fruits I bought
were about to ripen.

138
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,040
But if you're making green plum sauce,

139
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,490
they're just right.

140
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,740
Hurry up, move faster.

141
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,940
Why are you rushing?

142
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,530
All you do is rush, rush, rush.

143
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,010
Pay up and move them.

144
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,930
- I'll take them all.
- Okay.

145
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,210
200 taels for a secret.

146
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,730
Not expensive, right?

147
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,030
Miss,

148
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,480
are you going to buy it or not?

149
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,040
I'll be able to afford
the real one soon.

150
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,480
Could you be gentler?

151
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,160
I already am being gentle.

152
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,860
Can't you be more tender?

153
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,330
How tender do you want me to be?

154
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,770
This time, I won't let you slip away.

155
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,330
A couple of adulterers...

156
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,810
What are you two doing?

157
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,720
Didn't I tell you to lock the door?

158
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,280
Wow.

159
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,570
The cake you made

160
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,890
is actually quite good.

161
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,790
So, you must keep

162
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,010
our secret.

163
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,670
Why are you making such a fuss

164
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,740
over this?

165
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,680
It's not worth it.

166
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,500
So, just leave after you finish.

167
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,440
Don't come back.

168
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,260
How much money

169
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,360
do you two make in a month?

170
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,890
Not much.

171
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,280
Then I'll take 20% every month.

172
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,360
Is that too much?

173
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,970
- You're...
- Come on.

174
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,410
Who are you?

175
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,590
And who are you?

176
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,350
I'm the chief disciple of the master

177
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,690
from Mifang Pastry in Suzhou.

178
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,010
30% every month.

179
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,170
You go in first.

180
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,540
I'll handle it.

181
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,480
I'll talk to her.

182
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,960
What's wrong with you?

183
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,230
Go back now

184
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,290
and attend to Grandmother.

185
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,860
I'll give you a box

186
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,110
of pastries every month.

187
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,050
How about that?

188
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,050
What do you take me for?

189
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,880
I want money.

190
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,860
The Old Lady will buy pastries.

191
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,710
Yes.

192
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,690
If you don't give me money,

193
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,840
I'll go back

194
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,600
and tell Zhenzhu.

195
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,170
You can't be serious.

196
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,960
Are you so short of money?

197
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,090
Doesn't Grandmother give you
a monthly salary?

198
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm not a maid.

199
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,140
Where would I get a salary?

200
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,950
Just admit you're a maid.

201
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,750
I'm not a maid.

202
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,650
Then you have no money.

203
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,830
So, I'm getting it from you.

204
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,200
- I don't have money.
- Earn it.

205
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,570
Have you had enough of my respect?

206
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,210
Calm down, calm down.

207
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,360
Are you never going to stop?

208
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,230
Right?

209
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,330
Where did you come from?

210
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,710
I'll beat you!

211
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,650
Stop.

212
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,210
This is my last word.

213
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,960
I'll cover for you at home.

214
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,380
You two keep working hard.

215
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,230
What we talked about.

216
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,260
It's settled, okay?

217
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,590
I'm leaving now. Goodbye.

218
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,330
Jiao'e, Jiao'e.

219
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,470
- Let's talk.
- Come back.

220
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,450
Who is she?

221
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,780
Is she never going to stop?

222
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,020
She even told me to work hard.

223
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,860
- Who does she think she is?
- She's a nobody.

224
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,500
Are you crazy?

225
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,680
What's wrong with her?

226
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,230
She wants a share, and you just agree?

227
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,430
Do you really agree?

228
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,830
Listen, her 30%

229
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,830
comes out of your 60%.

230
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,030
It has nothing to do with me.

231
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,250
No, I...

232
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,000
If you get 40% and she gets 30%,

233
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,530
you'll be the boss, right?

234
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,600
Why are you here?

235
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,230
I thought you'd be too busy alone,

236
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,970
so I came to help.

237
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,540
Thank you.

238
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,140
I'm not that busy here.

239
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,020
But the flowers here

240
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,960
need changing.

241
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,350
I also brought some pastries for you.

242
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,330
What's this?

243
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,170
Tree peony, the most noble

244
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,320
of all flowers,

245
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,980
is suitable for honey maintenance.

246
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,810
Sweet and lasting.

247
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,860
That's nice.

248
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,720
Ruan Ling, what are you doing?

249
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,930
We are

250
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,290
arranging flowers.

251
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,980
This is an herbaceous peony.

252
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,200
I know.

253
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,590
I mean,

254
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,020
she's a tree peony.

255
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,690
You're disgusting.

256
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,210
Don't you have work to do?

257
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,530
I'm working right now.

258
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,120
What about the customers?

259
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,250
Then I'll go and work.

260
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,720
Please.

261
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,090
Lady Shuangxi,
why are you here again?

262
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,820
To keep an eye on him for you.

263
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,720
It's dangerous here.

264
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,070
Do you know how many losses

265
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,840
you've suffered without realizing it?

266
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm not suffering.

267
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,410
Did you hear what I said?

268
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,370
Keep going.

269
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,740
How about this?

270
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,230
Let's go to the yamen right now

271
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,840
and bring him to justice.

272
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,880
Go quickly, go.

273
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,500
We'll have lunch together at noon.

274
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Are we inviting him

275
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,660
for lunch?

276
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,840
It's fine if you don't come.

277
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,470
Guiwei, you don't have to work.

278
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,450
Stop bossing me around.

279
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,540
I have nothing else to do right now.

280
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,510
Don't you see the incense
hasn't been burned yet?

281
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,800
I'll do it.

282
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,600
Lady Shuangxi.

283
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,880
Don't touch it.

284
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,810
What are you doing with it?

285
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,740
Ruan Ling, I warn you.

286
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,120
Don't make it ring.

287
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,410
Don't make it ring. I...

288
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,800
Stop it.

289
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,080
Stop it.

290
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,260
He can't play it.

291
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,710
He's not playing it.

292
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,840
Plug your ears.

293
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,810
Plug your ears.

294
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,100
♪Thinking of your gentle face♪

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,500
♪Looking into your tender eyes♪

296
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:48,760
♪In my world, you shine bright♪

297
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,550
♪It's your gentle grace♪

298
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,520
Laowu, we're finally free.

299
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,790
We don't have a penny.

300
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,960
No money to rent a house.

301
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,080
Yes.

302
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,630
What's there to fear without money?

303
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,210
Don't forget what we do for a living.

304
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,800
Come on.

305
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,380
- Laowu.
- Laowu.

306
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,320
Causing trouble, huh?

307
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,370
Beat it!

308
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,890
Kick it.

309
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,100
(Careful Pastry)

310
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,050
Laowu, Laowu.

311
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,810
Your bench just hit me.

312
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
What to do?

313
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,590
Pay up, pay up!

314
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,690
Are you crazy?

315
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,190
How could a bench hit you?

316
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,430
Laowu, you're bleeding from the nose.

317
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,370
Yes.

318
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,590
Five taels of silver.

319
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,600
Not a single wen less.

320
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,990
Five taels, five taels.

321
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,930
Extorting us, huh?

322
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,590
Bullying me?

323
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,990
Don't you know who I am?

324
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,930
Alright, alright.

325
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,530
You wretched woman.

326
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,950
I won't believe it.

327
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,090
I'll come out if I want to.

328
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,360
Don't you want to see blood?

329
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,620
Go ahead and see blood.

330
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,210
I'll show you what blood looks like!

331
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,710
Let's see who's scamming whom.

332
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,650
Let's see it.

333
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,880
You're really extorting us.

334
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,950
- Laowu.
- Laowu.

335
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,450
- Report it!
- Report it!

336
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,370
Who can't do this?

337
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,530
Report it.

338
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,530
- Report it.
- Report it.

339
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,810
Who is standing below?

340
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,890
State your grievances.

341
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,050
Milord,

342
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,760
in broad daylight,

343
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,990
these villains not only

344
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,290
attempted to smash my shop

345
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,840
but also tried to slander

346
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,960
and blackmail me.

347
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,170
Please uphold justice for me.

348
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,690
A thief crying, "Catch the thief."

349
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,290
You placed

350
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,600
the bench in the way,

351
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,020
causing me to trip and fall.

352
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,590
- He has to compensate me.
- Yes.

353
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,730
Do you have any shame at all?

354
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,670
He also injured Laowu.

355
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,960
Silence!

356
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,310
Pi Laowu,

357
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,740
do you think I don't recognize you?

358
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,190
I know what kind of person you are.

359
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,610
You've been here several times.

360
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,050
You want compensation?

361
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,640
You're just trying to extort money.

362
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,740
No.

363
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,900
Alright, both parties
have suffered losses.

364
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,290
Let's just drop this.

365
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,780
Milord,

366
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,260
we can't just let this go.

367
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,640
They damaged my property.

368
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,230
You are suspected
of operating in the street.

369
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,070
A fine of five taels.

370
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,000
Are you satisfied now?

371
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,520
Milord,

372
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,820
they started the blackmail.

373
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,630
I didn't operate in the street.
Besides...

374
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,820
Why are you so persistent?

375
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,980
- That's my decision.
- Wait.

376
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,330
Is my word not final here?

377
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,610
Take him away.

378
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,130
Advisor,

379
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,680
he seems to be from the Jing Clan.

380
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,040
The Jing Clan?

381
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,600
Are you Jing Zhenzhu's husband?

382
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,810
Yes.

383
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,780
Isn't Jinyu Tea supposed

384
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,870
to be in the tea business?

385
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,710
Why are you

386
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,120
running a pastry stall now?

387
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,150
Well.

388
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,090
I understand.

389
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,400
Since you're from Jing,

390
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,680
here's what we'll do.

391
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,020
Pi Laowu and his gang
provoked trouble.

392
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,190
Send them to the Plantation.

393
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,130
Milord.

394
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,920
We just got out.

395
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,630
- Forgive me.
- Take them away.

396
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,600
You deserve it.

397
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,340
- Milord.
- No!

398
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,300
Don't.

399
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,600
Milord, milord.

400
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,760
You must be scared.

401
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,820
You should've told me you're from Jing.

402
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,880
We're all well-acquainted.

403
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,740
Yes, yes.

404
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,330
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

405
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,360
Then I'll just...

406
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,630
Well.

407
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,670
Since we helped you

408
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,820
settle such a big issue,

409
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,250
shouldn't you...?

410
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,290
I won't ask them for compensation.

411
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,010
That's not what I meant.

412
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,840
We don't want much.

413
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,130
Just 50 taels.

414
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,060
Milord,

415
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,100
you only fined five taels

416
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,190
for operating in the street.

417
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,600
A fine of five taels

418
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,880
for operating in the street.

419
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,220
The shop must cease operations,

420
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,570
and you must compensate Pi Laowu

421
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,430
with 45 taels for medical expenses.
That's it.

422
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,810
No, no, milord.

423
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,770
I'll just give you a tribute instead.

424
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,130
Good.

425
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,290
But I don't have any money.

426
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,000
Don't worry. We can send someone

427
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,300
to the Jing Residence to get it.

428
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,240
Absolutely not.

429
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,700
Do you also want to go
to the Plantation?

430
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,770
I'll deliver it personally.

431
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,930
Good.

432
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,390
Well.

433
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,530
You can go now.

434
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,720
Alright.

435
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,290
Don't go to the Jing Residence.

436
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,340
- I'm back.
- You're back.

437
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,680
Just in time. I was looking at it.

438
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,630
I think we need to replace
a lot of things here.

439
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,200
Tell me how much the compensation is.

440
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,650
Fifty taels.

441
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,060
So much?

442
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes.

443
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,340
A disaster became a blessing.

444
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,280
Yes.

445
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,340
It's enough to rent the shop next door.

446
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,740
Listen, our window...

447
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,680
I compensated for it.

448
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,090
I had to compensate for it.

449
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,090
You...

450
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,640
No, you...

451
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,530
Didn't you go

452
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
to seek justice?

453
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,570
Yes, I did find justice,

454
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,120
but seeking justice costs money.

455
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,120
So, you just

456
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,710
gave them the money?

457
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,650
Of course not.

458
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,290
I came back to get it from you.

459
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,690
Where would I get the money?

460
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,610
It's the money

461
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,950
we prepared for renting the shop.

462
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,730
Give it to me,
so I can go and buy justice.

463
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,260
Let's just forget about this justice.

464
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,340
We can't do it now.

465
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,810
No, I disagree.

466
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,060
Just because we only have
this small shop,

467
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,670
everyone can bully us every day.

468
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,110
But if I don't give them the money,

469
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,500
they'll go to the Jing Residence.

470
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,440
Let them go.

471
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,300
Then won't I be exposed?

472
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,710
What does that have to do with me?

473
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,470
Xiaoyu, we're in the same boat.

474
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,670
Who said so?

475
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,710
Listen, Lin Donglin.

476
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,150
I must rent the shop next door.

477
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,910
Yes, I'll definitely rent
the shop for you,

478
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,670
but if Zhenzhu

479
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,100
finds out about our business,

480
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,730
not only will we fail to rent this shop,

481
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,210
but our stall might be gone as well.

482
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:37,950
What do you mean?

483
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,230
You want to quit?

484
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,120
Alright, I'll stop now.

485
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,010
Let's just quit.

486
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,250
Xiaoyu, calm down.

487
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,600
I'll definitely rent the shop for you.

488
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,360
Give me the money first,

489
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,640
or justice will turn
into something inhumane.

490
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,150
Xiaoyu.

491
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,090
Go find the money.

492
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
- No.
- Get out.

493
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,330
I...

494
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,640
Jiao'e,

495
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,840
you're chewing too much.

496
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,150
A little tea

497
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,050
can freshen your breath
and whiten your teeth,

498
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,330
but too much tea

499
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,680
will make you smell like medicine.

500
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,990
I know.

501
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,930
Mind your own business.

502
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,960
Smell like medicine?

503
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,480
Who is it?

504
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,670
What a coincidence.

505
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,610
You're here, too.

506
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,470
Why are you troubled

507
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,680
by such a trifle?

508
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,570
Come to me for money.

509
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,710
- Do you have money?
- No.

510
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,250
Then what are you saying?

511
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,670
I'm at least

512
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,880
the shop owners.

513
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,160
One of them.

514
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,500
If there's trouble with the shop,

515
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,870
shouldn't you let me know?

516
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,250
Do you have a solution or not?

517
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,360
It's just 50 taels.

518
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,680
I'll find a way.

519
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,890
Jiao'e,

520
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,920
you're so responsible now.

521
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,150
I thought I'd have to pester you

522
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,060
before you'd agree.

523
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,820
What do you guys

524
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,670
- take me for?
- How nice.

525
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,910
I'm very reasonable.

526
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,850
Yes, yes.

527
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,490
I've seen it.

528
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,500
You mustn't let my grandmother

529
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,640
and my mother

530
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,130
know about this.

531
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,020
Most importantly,

532
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,780
you can't let Zhenzhu know, or else...

533
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,810
Alright, alright.

534
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,930
I know what to do.

535
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,050
Stop being so talkative.

536
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,680
You'd better be.

537
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,600
Do you not trust me to handle this?

538
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,820
I trust you.

539
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,760
Eat.

540
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,840
Where will you get the 50 taels?

541
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,200
Is it reliable?

542
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,020
I know plenty

543
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,160
of wealthy young masters.

544
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,680
Dear?

545
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,130
She's not here.

546
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,530
I really didn't expect

547
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,840
Lyu Jiao'e to be so reliable.

548
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,970
What were you chatting about?

549
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,090
Dear, you're here.

550
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,390
Lately,

551
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,050
you've been quite close to Lyu Jiao'e.

552
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,260
No.

553
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,730
I haven't gotten close to her.

554
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,810
Lin Donglin,

555
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,430
you haven't been betraying me,

556
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,360
have you?

557
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,630
Dear, why say that?

558
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,780
How can I possibly

559
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,330
do that?

560
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,250
You can't do that,

561
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,680
but you want to, right?

562
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,850
Dear,

563
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,340
you're really

564
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,390
sharp-tongued and intelligent.

565
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,560
I didn't say something right,

566
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,790
and you caught me.

567
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,330
Tell me. What were you chatting about?

568
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,680
I'll just be honest with you.

569
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,430
I partnered with a relative

570
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,640
to open a pastry shop.

571
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,060
Lyu Jiao'e caught us and thought

572
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,050
we were having an affair.

573
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,990
I had no choice
but to give her some shares.

574
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,530
Unexpectedly, the business is thriving,

575
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,060
and we want to rent a bigger shop.

576
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,830
Then some ruffians

577
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,300
tried to blackmail us for five taels,

578
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,100
but the Advisor demanded 50 taels.

579
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,040
I didn't have the money,

580
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,090
so I had to ask Jiao'e for a solution.

581
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,250
We didn't talk about anything.

582
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,370
Is that so?

583
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,050
If you

584
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,680
tell me now

585
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,090
and explain everything,

586
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,010
I might not get angry.

587
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,010
But

588
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,400
if I catch you,

589
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,530
I'll surely make you suffer.

590
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,730
I'll throw you out.

591
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,000
Dear.

592
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,330
I'll go get your foot-washing water.

593
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,100
What's this?

594
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,040
It's for you.

595
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,370
For me?

596
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,290
Thank you, Shuangxi.

597
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,090
How much is it?

598
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,630
Just keep it.

599
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,090
What I give must be the best.

600
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,230
Yes.

601
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,740
I was just asking

602
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,110
out of curiosity.

603
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,370
Ten taels.

604
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,760
Ten taels?

605
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,290
The shopkeeper
must be good at business.

606
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,280
You don't like it?

607
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,880
No, I like it. I like it very much.

608
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,990
Really?

609
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,970
Of course.

610
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,470
But your expression

611
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,840
doesn't show that you like it.

612
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,230
Don't lie to me.

613
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,740
How could I lie to you?

614
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,970
I really like it.

615
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,630
If you don't like it,

616
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,670
you can tell me.

617
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,630
I hope we can be honest

618
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,770
with each other.

619
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,680
Well, if I tell the truth,

620
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,430
you promise not to get angry.

621
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,370
I won't get angry.

622
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,240
You see, it's like this.

623
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,150
First of all, you gave me the cup.

624
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,330
I like it very much.

625
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,760
Secondly,

626
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,260
it's probably worth

627
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,360
at most one tael.

628
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,710
Really. Look at it.

629
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,240
First, the color isn't quite right.

630
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,120
The kiln temperature
likely wasn't high enough.

631
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,190
It was supposed to be made

632
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,630
into a conical shape,

633
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,360
but didn't you notice?
It's crooked here.

634
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,490
So, I said the cup is worth one tael

635
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,880
to spare your feelings.

636
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,430
So, you don't like it after all.

637
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,580
No. I really like it.

638
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,530
Don't patronize me.

639
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,630
I'm not patronizing you.

640
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,020
Your expression is patronizing.

641
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,990
I'm not patronizing you.

642
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,470
We agreed at the beginning.

643
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,730
You can't get angry, right?

644
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,990
Am I angry?

645
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,970
I'm not angry.

646
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,470
I went all the way to buy you a gift.

647
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,690
If it's not valuable, so be it.

648
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,630
Why would I be angry?

649
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,580
How can I be angry?

650
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,870
No, look.

651
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,470
You, you...

652
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,510
I'm just talking
about the matter itself.

653
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm not targeting you.
I'm talking about this cup.

654
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,670
It really isn't worth that much.

655
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,060
Now, you don't even pretend anymore,

656
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,990
do you?

657
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,470
No, I was pretending at first,

658
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,230
but you forced me to tell the truth.

659
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,530
I forced you?

660
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,910
I was just asking.

661
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,250
Does that mean I forced you?

662
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,330
Alright, give it back.

663
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,740
No, no.

664
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,240
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

665
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,120
Let's not make a fuss, shall we?

666
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,480
Make a fuss?

667
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,200
No, that's not what I meant.

668
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,670
- Give it back.
- I didn't mean it.

669
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,830
- I'm wrong.
- Give it back!

670
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,060
I...

671
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,160
I didn't mean to.

672
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,670
How dare you do this
to Lady Shuangxi?

673
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,610
I...

674
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,640
Did he bully you?

675
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,570
Yes.

676
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,600
Shuangxi, Shuangxi.

677
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,580
You're done for.

678
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,190
I've got you by the scruff of the neck.

679
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,730
I've got you.

680
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,050
Lady Shuangxi, report it.

681
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,050
Life is all about business.

682
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,090
The key to business is opportunity.

683
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,570
Opportunity is

684
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,440
for those who are prepared.

685
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,290
So, who are the prepared ones?

686
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,910
Those who are always ready

687
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,680
to take a chance.

688
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,960
Yes.

689
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,720
So,

690
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,640
my friends,

691
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,810
are you ready

692
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,260
to take a chance?

693
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,500
After all that you've said,

694
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,290
what business are you going
to take us into?

695
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,520
Exactly.

696
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,160
Careful.

697
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,920
There's no one else here.

698
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,710
I'm talking

699
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,300
about the business we're going to do.

700
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,970
The shop is called Careful Pastry.

701
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,150
Careful Pastry?

702
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,490
I've had it. It's delicious.

703
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,710
Have you?

704
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,710
So, how did you become

705
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,970
the owner of Careful Pastry?

706
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,640
I've got

707
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,770
plenty of things you don't know about.

708
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,390
But how can you guarantee

709
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,430
that it won't be a loss?

710
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,740
Yes, if it's a loss,

711
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,780
what about our money?

712
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,720
Yes.

713
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,250
To be honest,

714
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,200
that's how business is.

715
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,470
There's profit and loss.

716
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,060
If it were a sure thing,

717
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,160
why would I need you?

718
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,190
- Right.
- That's the point.

719
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,330
If you want to get rich,

720
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,200
and you don't have the guts,

721
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,290
then you'll be a maid for life.

722
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,330
So, how much money do you need?

723
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,770
Fifty taels is the limit.

724
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,300
- Fifty?
- Fifty?

725
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,340
Oh my God!

726
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,260
But I won't take

727
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,540
more than that.

728
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,870
No matter how much more.

729
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,600
Just 50 taels. Yes.

730
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,710
Fifty.

731
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,680
Fifty taels is too much.

732
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,920
Our monthly salary isn't much.

733
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,990
No, I've said it all.

734
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,680
Why are you still hesitating?

735
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,990
Let me ask you.

736
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,250
How much is your monthly salary?

737
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,360
What about 30 years later?

738
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,730
When the Jings no longer need you,

739
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,040
what will you do with that money?

740
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,100
Buy some land?

741
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,400
But you'll be old by then.

742
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,640
Will you still be able to work it?

743
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,360
So, I'll put in five taels.

744
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,430
For just five taels, I can become

745
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,020
an owner of Careful Pastry?

746
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,340
- I'm in.
- Good.

747
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,330
Let me count.

748
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,150
If you keep the money,

749
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,780
you'll spend it
on food and drink, right?

750
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,200
But if you leave it with me,

751
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,720
if we succeed,

752
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,190
and if the pastry business grows big,

753
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,640
then you'll be a pastry shop owner.

754
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,500
I'll be the owner.

755
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,630
- One of them.
- Fine.

756
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,470
But let me tell you.

757
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,770
You can't tell anyone else.

758
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,120
You give me a portion of money now,

759
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,820
and what I give you back

760
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,050
is a future.

761
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,260
Yes.

762
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,440
I've heard our Madam say

763
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,120
that tea is popular in Taiping County,

764
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,880
but there are no famous tea snacks.

765
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,880
It might be an opportunity.

766
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,260
- I'll put in five taels.
- Me too.

767
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,190
Count me in.

768
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,570
I'll put in ten taels.

769
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,810
One at a time. Don't rush.

770
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,480
Alright, alright.

771
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,710
Count me in.

772
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,680
I'll put in ten taels.

773
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,050
Here's fifty taels.

774
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,360
So fast?

775
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,230
The family doesn't know, right?

776
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,920
Don't worry. No one knows.

777
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,880
But you have to give me

778
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,830
10% of your share

779
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,160
as an offset for this money.

780
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,610
Jiao'e,

781
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,500
thank you.

782
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,440
What?

783
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,330
Are you deaf?

784
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,050
I said thank you.

785
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,760
Thank you, thank you.

786
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,250
Look, this is nothing.

787
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,390
It's a small matter.

788
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,440
Take your teeth back.

789
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,470
Once our shop is up

790
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,530
and running,

791
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,740
we'll open one
in North Port, South Market,

792
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,910
East Street, and West Alley.

793
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,840
Once these shops are thriving,

794
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,730
we'll go straight to Anning Prefecture.

795
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,430
Yes, yes.

796
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,220
Once we're established
in Anning Prefecture,

797
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,700
we'll open shops in the Capital

798
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
and Suzhou.

799
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,630
By then,

800
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,820
if the noble and the wealthy

801
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,440
like our pastries,

802
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,710
our pastries

803
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,440
will become as renowned

804
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,810
as Jinyu Tea.

805
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,170
Yes.

806
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,210
Great. It'll be passed down
through the ages.

807
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,920
Speaking of which,

808
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,540
it's all thanks to you two,

809
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,490
my subordinates,

810
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,780
so our shop can get off

811
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,730
to such a smooth start.

812
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,740
Thank you, thank you both.

813
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,680
Don't thank me yet.

814
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,840
Subordinates?

815
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,630
When did we become

816
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,770
such close partners?

817
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,920
I put in the money.

818
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,500
That's hilarious.

819
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,600
Let me ask you.

820
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,840
Could this shop even open

821
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,890
without my skills?

822
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,990
If it weren't for my brains,

823
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,390
it would have collapsed by now.

824
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,050
Without you, the shop wouldn't collapse.

825
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,430
Alright, you said it.

826
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,370
Give me my money back.

827
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,540
I can't. You can't take it.

828
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,570
No, no, Jiao'e, Jiao'e.

829
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,630
(Careful Pastry)
Stop it.

830
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,090
- Alright.
- Give me my money back!

831
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,550
I'll have Lady Shuangxi
report it sooner or later.

832
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,680
Nothing slips
through the net of heaven.

833
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,480
Shuangxi.

834
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,450
Shuangxi,

835
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,080
I'm sorry.

836
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,890
After that day,

837
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,280
I reflected deeply.

838
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,750
I focused on arguing with you

839
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,930
about the value of this cup,

840
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,740
and I overlooked
the most important thing.

841
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,640
Your feelings.

842
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,760
I reflected for a long time

843
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,320
after I went back.

844
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,530
I was really foolish.

845
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,570
Can you forgive me?

846
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,250
Look at this cup.

847
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,490
I've already mended it.

848
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,640
What's the use of saying this now?

849
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,710
- Well...
- Unless

850
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,220
you come to my place tonight

851
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,410
and mend all my broken wine cups.

852
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,440
Alright.

853
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,050
I'll come over once I'm done here.

854
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,080
I'll mend them.

855
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,440
Wait.

856
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,490
You mean "mend"

857
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,090
as in "cohabit" in Chinese?

858
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,250
- No.
- No.

859
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,680
Are you two

860
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,100
like Zhuge Liang and Huang Gai...

861
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,280
It's Zhou Yu.

862
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,090
Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu...

863
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,210
Doesn't Zhuge Liang

864
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,260
have better things to do?

865
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,280
It's Zhou Yu who punished

866
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,810
Huang Gai.

867
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,490
One punishes,

868
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,760
and the other accepts?

869
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,250
- No.
- No.

870
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,700
You're deceiving me!

871
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,280
You're frauds!

872
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,600
Frauds!
