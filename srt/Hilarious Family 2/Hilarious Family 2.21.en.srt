Here.

29
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,300
Seeing this chicken wing,

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,660
it reminds me...

31
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,620
A lovely couple?

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,020
No, no.

33
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,100
What are you thinking?

34
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,540
Hurry up and see

35
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,620
the staple food. Hurry.

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,900
Alright.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,820
Wanqing, eat up.

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,460
- Eat more.
- I'm eating.

39
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,180
Speaking of which, you and Jing Kan

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,380
are childhood sweethearts.

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,490
- We're not.
- You are.

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,180
Why deny it?

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,740
Sixi, come on, eat.

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,660
Sure.

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,180
Jing Kan,

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,300
the Tea Contest is coming up.

47
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,820
Though we

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,340
have a bet,

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
I still hope

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,620
you can shine

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,780
in the contest.

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,780
Look.

53
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,820
Wanqing is a tea expert.

54
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,020
You two can discuss

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,460
how to win this contest.

56
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,060
I believe

57
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,220
you two will have

58
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,900
a lot in common to talk about.

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,160
- Actually...
- Don't worry.

60
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,720
I'll definitely help if I can.

61
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,060
Sixi,

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,060
this daylily

63
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
is getting cold.

64
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,500
Eat it while it's hot.

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,460
Alright.

66
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,020
Ai Sixi, let me ask you.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,460
Are you just carefree,

68
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,840
or do you not care about me at all?

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
You do have a forgetful face.

70
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,380
I do forget

71
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,220
insignificant things.

72
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,780
I mean, you forget about me.

73
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,520
Luo Zhusi is

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,500
clearly using An Wanqing

75
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,980
to sow discord between us.

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,900
Can't you see that?

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,420
What discord?

78
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,180
Are you acting again?

79
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,820
Just kidding. Don't be angry.

80
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,460
Don't be angry.

81
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,660
I just think

82
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,620
what Luo Zhusi said

83
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,500
makes some sense.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,580
You and Wanqing
should study tea together.

85
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,500
I definitely won't hold you two back.

86
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,060
Alright, if that's what you say,

87
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,420
I won't feel any burden in my heart.

88
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,180
If something really happens between us,

89
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,460
don't blame me.

90
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,900
Blame you for what?

91
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,060
Let me tell you.

92
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,660
Relationships

93
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,620
are built over time.

94
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,220
Just let Luo Zhusi play matchmaker

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,260
for me and An Wanqing.

96
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,740
If it works out, don't regret it.

97
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,460
If she can succeed,

98
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,700
it means you two
will end up together anyway.

99
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,240
It has nothing to do with matchmaking.

100
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,540
Alright.

101
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,700
Ai Sixi, listen.

102
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,060
Starting today,

103
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,580
I will let go of all my guard

104
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,700
against An Wanqing...

105
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,020
No, Wanqing.

106
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,860
No, no.

107
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,140
You can't let go completely.

108
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,120
You know you'll regret it, right?

109
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,140
I'm worried

110
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,900
that being with her

111
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,340
might hurt you.

112
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,420
What do you mean?

113
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,300
Whatever I do,

114
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,500
it doesn't change a thing.

115
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,620
Two on top, five on the bottom.

116
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,100
Dear.

117
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,140
Come and see the new cake.

118
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,300
Zhenzhu Cake.

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,780
I had them specially name it.

120
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,700
Here.

121
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,660
Try some.

122
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,220
Make 100 portions for me.

123
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,820
I need to give them to guests tomorrow.

124
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,100
A hundred portions?

125
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,760
Is there any problem?

126
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,660
No, no.

127
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,900
Is that enough?

128
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,980
The shop name implies Gu Xiaoyu

129
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,940
in Chinese,

130
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,900
and what about you?

131
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,580
Dear, don't misunderstand.

132
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,820
The pastry shop has nothing

133
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,060
to do with Gu Xiaoyu.

134
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,380
You always tell me

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,180
to be careful,

136
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,020
so I just like the word

137
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,460
and name it "Careful".

138
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,020
It doesn't concern Gu Xiaoyu?

139
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,820
I swear, not at all.

140
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,100
Alright.

141
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,780
I've given you a chance.

142
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,240
If you really have something

143
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,220
with Gu Xiaoyu,

144
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,320
you'd better confess sooner.

145
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,500
I'll make things easy for you.

146
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,700
What are you talking about?

147
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,580
Don't think
that just because you opened a shop

148
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,700
and became the Chief,

149
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm after something from you.

150
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,780
Dear,

151
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,820
why are you saying this?

152
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,700
Between us, what's there to be after?

153
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,140
What's mine is yours,

154
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,780
and what's yours

155
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,700
is still yours.

156
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,380
Donglin,

157
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,300
sit down.

158
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,220
Sit.

159
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,180
Dear,

160
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,720
you haven't called me that in a while.

161
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,940
Could you tell me

162
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
how you opened your shop?

163
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,300
At first,

164
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,480
it was indeed a bit difficult,

165
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,780
because the money...

166
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,540
Dear, I was wrong.

167
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,020
I sincerely want to ask you.

168
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,900
Tell me.

169
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,320
From preparing to hiring people

170
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
and earning the first sum of money,

171
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
what exactly did you do?

172
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,460
Tell me

173
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,580
everything clearly.

174
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,300
Dear, I dare not do it again.

175
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
I've confessed everything I can.

176
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,140
- I don't have...
- Just say it!

177
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,420
Dear, there's nothing going on

178
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,940
between Gu Xiaoyu and me.

179
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
She's just my relative.

180
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,780
Yes, once I helped her tie her apron,

181
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,500
and when she turned around, I dodged.

182
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,220
There's nothing going on between us.

183
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,440
She truly is my relative.
You have to believe me.

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,300
It's like talking to a wall.
Why is it so hard?

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,580
- No.
- With your comprehension,

186
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,900
- you're running a shop?
- Dear.

187
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,200
Someone might think you stole it.

188
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,680
- Dear!
- What a fool. Get lost.

189
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,260
Wasn't my answer sincere enough?

190
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,670
Coming.

191
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,380
The old woman mends her clothes.

192
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,020
The fish gazes at the beauty.

193
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,340
Then they fall in love.

194
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,020
What a great line!

195
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,780
Indeed, only the president

196
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,340
has the right to finish

197
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,380
our two and a half lines.

198
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,620
You flatterers.

199
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,060
Vice President Jing,

200
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
why haven't I seen you lately?

201
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,940
Busy, of course.

202
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,200
What could she be busy with?

203
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,460
Putting on airs.

204
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,140
Right, leave them here.

205
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
You may go now.

206
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Yes, milady.

207
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,380
Chief Zhenzhu.

208
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,540
Zhenzhu,

209
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,140
what kind of chief are you?

210
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,980
I just got a small shop

211
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,460
under Jinyu Tea.

212
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,020
I didn't want it,

213
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,140
but they insisted.

214
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,340
By the way...

215
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,340
What are these?

216
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,220
Some cakes.

217
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,700
I especially brought them

218
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,020
for you to try.

219
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,740
Zhenzhu Cake?

220
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,060
Careful Pastry?

221
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,700
That's all the rage

222
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,980
in Taiping County

223
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,060
recently.

224
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,020
What's your connection

225
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,060
with this pastry shop?

226
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,940
It's one of my small businesses.

227
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,900
Ms. Jing,

228
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,420
this is quite an achievement.

229
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,340
The election for the next president

230
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,700
is coming up soon.

231
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,940
I'll definitely support you.

232
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,460
Yes, I'll support you, too.

233
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,080
If I go to the pastry shop

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,940
and mention your name,
can I skip the line?

235
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Of course.

236
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,460
That's easy for me.

237
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,980
President Wan.

238
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,140
What, Vice President?

239
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,540
I won't

240
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,860
be participating

241
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,180
in the next election

242
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,180
for the Tea Guild president.

243
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,340
You won't?

244
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,580
No, I won't.

245
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,780
Because if I do,

246
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,420
I'll definitely be elected.

247
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,980
Yes, yes.

248
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,580
That's not

249
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,660
necessarily true.

250
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,340
If you agree to one condition,

251
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,180
not only will I not run,

252
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,620
but I'll also support you

253
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,460
to continue as the next president.

254
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,820
What condition?

255
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,420
From now on,

256
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,700
all the tea used by the Tea Guild

257
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,140
must come from the Wushen Temple Shop

258
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,980
of Jinyu Tea.

259
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,940
No problem.

260
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,060
Deal.

261
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,780
Let's all try some.

262
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,060
Alright, alright.

263
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,060
(Heavenly Feathers)

264
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,300
- My goodness.
- Be careful.

265
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
What happened?

266
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,540
Why are you so drunk?

267
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,740
You're so drunk.

268
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,620
Be careful.

269
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,540
My goodness.

270
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,150
- The stairs.
- Tell me.

271
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,260
Milady.

272
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,420
You really worry me.

273
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,660
If we hadn't come,

274
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,460
wouldn't you have slept on the street?

275
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,420
That can't happen.

276
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,460
Lie down.

277
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,320
Be careful.

278
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,250
Lie down, lie down.

279
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,220
- Let me.
- Okay.

280
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,140
Go make her some sobering soup.

281
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,060
Alright.

282
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,140
My goodness.

283
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,780
Don't touch me.

284
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,820
I'm not drunk.

285
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,380
Alright, alright.

286
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,420
I don't need

287
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,340
any help.

288
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,540
Yes, you're not drunk.

289
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,380
Mother,

290
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,700
let me tell you.

291
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,580
Today, I earned

292
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,420
the first money

293
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,700
of my life.

294
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,060
No one would dare

295
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,940
to say I'm useless again.

296
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,300
This...

297
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,820
Are you feeling unwell, Zhenzhu?

298
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,780
Mother,

299
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,940
am I your own daughter?

300
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,980
Of course, you are.

301
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,300
Then

302
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,300
if I spoke harshly this morning,

303
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,060
you mustn't take it to heart.

304
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,820
My goodness.

305
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,260
I'm your mother.

306
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,540
Whatever you said,

307
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,060
I couldn't have taken it to heart.

308
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,220
How could there be a grudge between us?

309
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,820
Let me

310
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,660
show you something good.

311
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,060
What is it?

312
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,700
Do you know what this is?

313
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,660
Fifty taels as a deposit.

314
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,620
I earned this

315
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,660
all by myself.

316
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,060
My daughter is so good.

317
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,580
What are you doing?

318
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,820
I'll keep this for you.

319
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,060
You just took it like that?

320
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,020
I'll keep it for you,

321
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,340
so you won't waste it.

322
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
You just made your first deal,

323
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,300
and you went out and splurged.

324
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,820
Do you know how much you spent?

325
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,660
My child, don't worry.

326
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,060
When you grow up,

327
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,820
I'll definitely give it back to you.

328
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,060
My goodness,

329
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,140
this is so familiar.

330
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,820
This line sounds so familiar.

331
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,740
Zhenzhu, listen to me.

332
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,340
While I'm still alive,

333
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,580
I can take care of you.

334
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,820
But what if one day

335
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,020
I'm gone?

336
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,180
Don't worry about that.

337
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,420
I have a way.

338
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,700
What way do you have?

339
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
I'll sell your house.

340
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,740
If you sell my house,

341
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,860
where am I supposed to live?

342
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,060
Aren't you dead by then?

343
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,700
Living in that place will be scary.

344
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,740
What if I want to come back and see you?

345
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,060
Where should I go then?

346
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,620
Then don't come back.

347
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,660
I'll go find you, alright?

348
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,100
I'll kill myself.

349
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,340
My child.

350
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,660
I can't chat with you anymore.

351
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,300
Don't leave. Give me my money back.

352
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,460
Forget it.

353
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,060
Aren't you drunk? Just go to sleep.

354
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm not drunk. I'm sober.

355
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,900
My goodness, my shoes!

356
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,580
My shoes!

357
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,980
Give me my money back!

358
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,900
What kind of mother are you?

359
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,400
Treating your own daughter like this.

360
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,640
It's just 50 taels.

361
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,260
I'm so angry.

362
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,340
How has Aji been lately?

363
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,540
I heard from someone

364
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,060
at Fu's Restaurant that he's been

365
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,180
doing well lately.

366
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,260
He follows Ms. Zhu around every day,

367
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,180
learning from her.

368
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,660
He's like a completely different man.

369
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,080
Ms. Zhu has even
praised him several times.

370
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,060
That's great.

371
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,460
But I also heard

372
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,820
that Young Master Aji

373
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,140
used the money he earned

374
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,060
in the past half month

375
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,220
to buy a pair of earrings for Ms. Zhu.

376
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,300
Is that true?

377
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,660
That's great.

378
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,820
It means the boy

379
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,500
has finally learned

380
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
some social skills.

381
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,580
No, Madam.

382
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,100
Don't you think

383
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,980
buying earrings is a bit...

384
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,540
What?

385
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,940
A bit romantic?

386
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,740
Romantic?

387
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,060
I've noticed you've been

388
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,340
picking on Aji lately.

389
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,580
I haven't.

390
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,980
Then I won't say it.

391
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,260
You'd better not.

392
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,180
Wanqing, Wanqing.

393
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,520
What's wrong?

394
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,940
Do you remember when we were little,

395
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,220
we used to play jianzi here?

396
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,500
I remember.

397
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,820
Let's play again.

398
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,720
Now?

399
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,260
Aren't you supposed to be making tea?

400
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,420
Why play jianzi now?

401
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,840
We need a balance of work and rest.

402
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,980
Look.

403
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,540
I've already bought the jianzi.

404
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,380
Today might not be a good day.

405
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,760
I was thinking of inviting Sixi...

406
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,540
Don't go.

407
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,940
Let's just play jianzi here.

408
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
Come on, are you ready?

409
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,180
Catch it!

410
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,140
Wanqing, come on.

411
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,500
What are you doing?

412
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,460
Why are you so careless?

413
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,020
What's wrong with you today?

414
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,860
What do you mean? I'm perfectly normal.

415
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,820
I'm here for you.

416
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,180
I...

417
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,780
Sixi,

418
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,120
do you want to go to South Market?

419
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,020
Not today.
I have something important to do.

420
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,060
You go play with him.

421
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,060
You're sweating. Here.

422
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,820
Use my handkerchief.

423
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,820
Use it, so you don't catch a cold.

424
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,940
I'm in a hurry.

425
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,820
I wanted to ask you just now.

426
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,980
Actually, I'm quite good

427
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,380
at reading people.

428
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,240
I can tell

429
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,460
that you're trying to use me

430
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,660
to make Sixi jealous, right?

431
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,940
Absolutely impossible.

432
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,540
You can use me all you want,

433
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,940
but please have some boundaries, okay?

434
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,700
What do you mean?

435
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,340
I have no boundaries, An Wanqing?

436
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,300
Say that again.

437
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,420
Dear,

438
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,340
I don't think we need to do anything.

439
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,300
It looks like it's almost done.

440
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,660
Go and arrange

441
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,580
An Wanqing's room.

442
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,460
Make it as cozy as possible.

443
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,940
Without An Wanqing,

444
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,460
it feels so much more comfortable.

445
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,580
Look at this.

446
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,820
Books, all kinds of books.

447
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,700
Books on the tea ceremony.
Secret manuals.

448
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,100
Sir,

449
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,260
do you have any secret manuals

450
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,160
on making tea?

451
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,420
I have a few,

452
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,580
but they're not cheap.

453
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,080
It's okay. I'll take them all.

454
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,060
Wrap them up for me.

455
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,660
Alright.

456
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,900
(Books)

457
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,300
Luo Aji?

458
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,580
Here.

459
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,460
Didn't I tell you to go
to Chief Xin to buy rice?

460
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,700
Why did you buy this?

461
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,580
I've ordered the rice.

462
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,700
I had it delivered directly
to our restaurant.

463
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,220
Didn't you say yesterday

464
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,260
you wanted to eat
lotus leaf glutinous rice cake?

465
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,540
I bought it for you

466
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,940
on my way.

467
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,900
Did you go to North Warehouse?

468
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,540
I did.

469
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,080
You can ask at the restaurant.

470
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,500
Really?

471
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,460
Really.

472
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,300
Try it.

473
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,380
It's still warm.

474
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,980
Of course.

475
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,180
You can't eat cold food.

476
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,500
Don't do this next time.

477
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,300
So sweet.

478
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,260
Is there any particular reason

479
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,140
you've decorated
the guest room like this?

480
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,300
Jing Kan.

481
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,940
Look.

482
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,220
You two are both here.

483
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,900
- Yes.
- Let me tell you.

484
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,060
I just found

485
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,780
some rare tea manuals at the market.

486
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,420
Take a look. Maybe they'll be helpful.

487
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,740
You went shopping?

488
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,780
Didn't you say you weren't going?

489
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,460
Why did you go without me?

490
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,300
I was running errands

491
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,540
and bought them on my way back.

492
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,380
That's not important.

493
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,300
What's important is

494
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,500
that I've discovered

495
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
Luo Aji's new love interest.

496
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,380
Is that so? Who is it?

497
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,140
A very beautiful and gentle lady.

498
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
Who is Luo Aji?

499
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,660
In less than an hour, Luo Aji ran

500
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,380
from North Warehouse to South Market

501
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,540
just to buy

502
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,460
a lotus leaf glutinous rice cake
for her.

503
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,660
Most importantly,

504
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,020
the cake was still warm,

505
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,900
because he was afraid

506
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,380
it'd get cold and hurt her stomach.

507
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,980
That's hilarious.

508
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,300
Doesn't this decoration

509
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,360
look like a wedding chamber?

510
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,820
It does.

511
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,780
How true.

512
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,260
So you like this style,

513
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,300
Wanqing?

514
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
As your husband,

515
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,940
don't you think I'm out of place here?

516
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,380
As long as you can make good tea,

517
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,540
you can be anywhere.

518
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,340
Madam,

519
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,220
they were talking about Aji, right?

520
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,220
I'm not deaf.

521
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,660
The lady that the wench mentioned

522
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,260
must be Ms. Zhu.

523
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,740
They're together all the time.

524
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,700
No way.

525
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,180
Why not?

526
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,220
Just because I say so?

527
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,860
Shut up.

528
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,700
(Fu's Restaurant)

529
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,140
Come on, cheers.

530
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,300
Bottom up.

531
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,140
Good, good.

532
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,800
What a capacity for wine. Fill it up.

533
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,740
I can't drink anymore.

534
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,660
Wan'er,

535
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,100
you can't pretend to be drunk.

536
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,740
If you won't drink with us,

537
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,300
then we'll go

538
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,780
to Zuixian Restaurant next time.

539
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,180
We're having such a good time today.

540
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,380
Let's switch to bigger bowls.

541
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,220
Come on, drink.

542
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,300
Drink, drink.

543
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,780
Drink, drink, drink.

544
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,940
Drink, drink.

545
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,420
Who are you?

546
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,760
Who said you could drink for her?

547
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,300
I'm a helper here.

548
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,860
You want to drink, right?

549
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,540
Yuanbao,

550
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,460
bring a basin.

551
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,780
Madam, Young Master Aji is over there.

552
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,380
Why is he drinking everything?

553
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,620
Please.

554
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,700
Look, he's been drinking for Ms. Zhu.

555
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,180
I told you. They must be together.

556
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,100
Why say that?

557
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,180
Stop guessing.

558
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,100
Let's go, let's go.

559
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,740
Come on.

560
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,940
You never listen to me.

561
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,900
What about this?

562
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What about this?

563
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,980
Young Master Aji wouldn't do anything

564
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,460
unseemly, would he?

565
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,060
No.

566
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,780
Don't talk nonsense.

567
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,020
Aji is a gentleman.

568
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,300
With all this going on,

569
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,700
is there something between them?

570
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,660
It's normal.

571
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,700
Rest well.

572
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,460
See you tomorrow morning.

573
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,100
Aji.

574
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,660
Thank you.

575
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,780
Milady,

576
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,620
you have to think of a solution.

577
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,760
I noticed early on

578
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,240
that something was off between them.

579
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,100
Besides, doesn't Young Master Aji like

580
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,420
older ladies?

581
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
You just pushed him

582
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,940
into the fire.

583
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,580
You even asked us

584
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,940
to take care of him,

585
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,420
lest he be distracted.

586
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,220
You're such a good matchmaker.

587
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,340
Where are you going?

588
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,020
I'm going to talk to Aji.

589
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,220
Milady.

590
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,660
Move aside.

591
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,300
- You can't go.
- Move aside.

592
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,460
Milady,

593
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,980
going now won't help.

594
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,140
It will only upset

595
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,060
Young Master Aji.

596
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,140
But I can't just stand by

597
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,020
and watch them together.

598
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,300
Remember last time with Zhao Yingxi?

599
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,540
He didn't care that much,

600
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,860
yet he was so angry with you,

601
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,700
even saying

602
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,940
you were only his auntie, not his mother.

603
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,020
This time,

604
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,740
if you upset him again,

605
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,420
you won't even be his auntie anymore.

606
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,940
Then what will I be?

607
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,100
What do you think?

608
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Why ask me? I don't know.

609
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,420
He'll just disown you.

610
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,740
Milady,

611
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,700
calm down first.

612
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,540
We must hold our ground.

613
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,460
Hold our ground.

614
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,380
Cuiying, stop pacing.

615
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,700
I'm dizzy.

616
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,540
I have a plan.

617
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,500
Time to eat.

618
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,020
I'm not eating.

619
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,940
Still not eating?

620
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,660
You're so thin.

621
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,260
I cooked braised pork trotters

622
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,100
just for you.

623
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,460
I'm not hungry.

624
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,740
Where do you find a child like you?

625
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,180
Where do you find a mother like you?

626
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,700
This is all the money I've saved for you

627
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,600
since you were little.

628
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,780
A total

629
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,740
of 2,825 taels of silver.

630
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,020
Feel better now?

631
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,980
I won't take your money.

632
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,980
I've been saving it for you.

633
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,460
It was always mine.

634
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,860
It was always mine.

635
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,260
Look at yourself.

636
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,940
Yesterday, I thought about it.

637
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
I'll stop interfering.

638
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,140
I've heard this so many times

639
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,620
that my ears are calloused.

640
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,870
Milady, this time it's for real.

641
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,120
Madam cried for half the night

642
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,860
last night.

643
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,340
Why tell her that?

644
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
You...

645
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,940
You cried again?

646
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,790
You still cry a lot

647
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,100
even at your age.

648
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,500
Now that I'm independent,

649
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,620
shouldn't you be happy?

650
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,340
I did think about it carefully

651
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,020
last night.

652
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,540
Listen.

653
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,940
I'm just afraid that suddenly,

654
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,940
you won't need me anymore.

655
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,940
Ever since you were little,

656
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,660
I've worried about you so much.

657
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,540
Suddenly, you're independent,

658
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
and I feel

659
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,140
a bit

660
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,460
out of place.

661
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,780
Mother,

662
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,820
as I grow,

663
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,620
you should grow too, right?

664
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,400
You've been so good to me
and worried so much about me

665
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,460
since I was little.

666
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,140
I remember it all.

667
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,860
Yes, yes, my child.

668
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,660
The last thing

669
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,140
I will do for you

670
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,380
is to let go.

671
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,020
Zhenzhu,

672
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,780
good girl.

673
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,700
You must take care of yourself.

674
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,500
If you ever need anything from me,

675
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,260
just let me know.

676
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,180
I'll always be there for you.

677
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,620
What do you mean?

678
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,020
Aren't you just next door?

679
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,300
Or should I have someone

680
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,020
knock down the wall
between our chambers?

681
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,380
There you go again.

682
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,220
Forget it, forget it.

683
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
Come on.

684
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,980
(Harmonious Family Prosper)
Look.

685
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,940
There are no festivals coming.

686
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,980
Why write this?

687
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,620
Can't you see?

688
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,460
Harmonious family prosper.

689
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,440
Do you know
where I'm going to stick this?

690
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Didn't you break the door yesterday?

691
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,540
How ugly it looks.

692
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,500
Look.

693
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,220
I'll stick it here.

694
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,860
What do you think?

695
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,620
Isn't it better now?

696
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,700
Silly.

697
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,780
Later, you stick

698
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,740
the back too.

699
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,660
When it's done,

700
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,760
the whole room

701
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,980
will be completely different.

702
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,500
It'll instantly brighten up the place.

703
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,740
Yes, Madam.

704
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,860
Are you happy now?

705
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,940
How silly.

706
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,500
Put this away.

707
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
Mingxia,

708
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,420
put this away.

709
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,380
Why glare at me again?

710
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,300
It's for you.

711
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,540
Keep it.

712
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,060
Go eat some trotters.

713
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,780
Come on.

714
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,260
You have such a childlike temper.

715
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,460
Let me ask you one thing.

716
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,740
Do you know how old Aji is?

717
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,700
If you still take me as your friend,

718
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,140
just let it go.

719
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,700
I'll act as if nothing ever happened.

720
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,620
If not,

721
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,500
don't blame me for doing something

722
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,540
out of line.

723
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,700
Wan'er,

724
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,100
pepper vinegar goose from Rong's Deli.

725
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,660
I was just talking casually,

726
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,860
and you went all the way
to Anning Prefecture?

727
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,900
There's no such thing as "just talking".

728
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,100
If you want it, you want it.

729
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,260
Try it.

730
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,300
Aji,

731
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,500
I know what you're thinking,

732
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,660
but it's impossible.

733
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,660
Why is it impossible?

734
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,220
You're still young.

735
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,500
A lot of things
are just a fleeting fancy.

736
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,700
Trust me.

737
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,700
You'll have better choices.

738
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,740
But I've already found

739
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,820
the best choice.

740
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,500
Why should I look for something better?

741
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,620
Aji,

742
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,660
be realistic.

743
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,900
In ten years, you'll be in your prime,

744
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,820
while I

745
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,900
will be old and faded.

746
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,300
Do you really want to spend
the rest of your life

747
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,940
with a middle-aged woman

748
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,140
in your prime?

749
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,980
We won't get anyone's blessing,

750
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,540
especially

751
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,100
not your family's.

752
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,860
Did my auntie come to see you?

753
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,940
I'll go find her.

754
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,860
No.

755
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,100
Yuanbao told me

756
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,220
she came today.

757
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
She just talked

758
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,260
about some business matters.

759
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,380
Aji,

760
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,540
forget it.

761
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,900
I know you could miss out on me,

762
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,900
but I can't miss out on you.

763
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,700
(Exquisite Tea)

764
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Eat something.

765
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,060
Mother.

766
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,740
- Aji's back.
- Mother.

767
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,060
Aji,

768
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,660
you've lost weight.

769
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,300
Mother, why did you come over

770
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,780
without letting me know in advance?

771
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,460
Your birthday is coming soon.

772
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,900
Your auntie and I

773
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
wanted to surprise you.

774
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,540
Thank you, Auntie.

775
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,700
Sit down, Aji.

776
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,020
Come and sit.

777
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,220
I heard from your auntie

778
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,180
that you've taken a liking to a girl.

779
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,140
Don't say I told you.

780
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,700
I heard it from Cuiying.

781
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,060
Mother,

782
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,260
do you want to meet Wan'er?

783
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,580
Sure.

784
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,420
Alright.

785
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,780
I'll go tell Wan'er.

786
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,500
Let me tell you.

787
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,940
After you see her tonight,

788
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,180
you must make Aji change his mind.

789
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,140
Got it?

790
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,820
Got it.

791
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,660
Rest assured.

792
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,300
I'll definitely try to persuade him.

793
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,220
Come and sit.

794
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,780
Have some tea.

795
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,830
Eat.

796
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,540
Zhusi.

797
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,740
You're back.

798
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,700
How did it go?

799
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,020
I agreed.

800
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
How could you agree?

801
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,020
Zhu Wan'er is really nice.

802
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,980
Even though...

803
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,580
I don't know what you're thinking.

804
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,500
Come on.

805
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,980
Zhusi, don't worry.

806
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,180
I think Zhu Wan'er is really nice.

807
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,540
She's not only beautiful

808
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,700
but also talented

809
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,660
and wealthy.

810
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,780
Most importantly,

811
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,300
she's very caring.

812
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,460
I didn't ask you

813
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,700
to check out Zhu Wan'er.

814
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,780
I asked you to break them up.

815
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,740
If she's so nice,

816
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,820
why break them up?

817
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,780
It's just not right.

818
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,620
Is it because you two

819
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,700
used to be friends

820
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,060
that you can't accept it?

821
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,140
I think it's because

822
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,700
he's not your son

823
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,900
that you agreed.

824
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,300
Zhusi,

825
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,460
I'll be sincere with you.

826
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,220
I do have my own daughter,

827
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,700
but I care about Aji much more than her.

828
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,460
Life is short, just a few decades.

829
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,740
He should be

830
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,180
with someone he likes.

831
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,740
Do you want Aji

832
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,500
to be drowned in gossip?

833
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,620
People's words are terrifying.
Do you know that?

834
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,140
People's words are terrifying.

835
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,100
They'll be ridiculed

836
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,700
so much.

837
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,500
Let me tell you.

838
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,860
This is

839
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,460
absolutely impossible.

840
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,540
Call Aji over now

841
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,820
and make him give up in front of me.

842
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,020
Alright.

843
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,100
Mother,

844
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,260
why do you disagree now?

845
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,740
I think

846
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,420
she's a bit too old.

847
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,220
I don't care.

848
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
Tell him what you think.

849
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,300
Tell him.

850
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,980
But I care.

851
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,820
If my daughter-in-law were my age,

852
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,580
what would people say?

853
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,100
She is a bit older,

854
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,620
but it's okay, right?

855
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,860
But...

856
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,020
Alright, I got it.

857
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Alright.

858
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,140
I said it exactly

859
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,420
as you told me.

860
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,700
Are you satisfied now?

861
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,380
- Thanks.
- I knew it.

862
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,340
Just now,

863
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,180
you exchanged looks.

864
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,860
Auntie, why do you force my mother

865
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,300
to make me break up with Wan'er?

866
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,540
Aji.

867
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,660
Aji,

868
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
one day,

869
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,420
you'll understand

870
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,860
my good intentions.

871
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,340
Mother,

872
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,900
why do you have to listen to her?

873
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,940
Your auntie makes sense.

874
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,660
But I want to hear your real thoughts.

875
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,260
You're my mother.

876
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,220
Your auntie knows better
how to be a mother than I do.

877
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,060
But she has no children.

878
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,980
Come on.

879
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,140
Even so, she's seen

880
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,300
what other mothers always do.

881
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,140
That's nonsense.

882
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,460
Why snap at my mother?

883
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,700
Why shout at your auntie?

884
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,460
Why hit him?

885
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,620
Why snap at my mother again?

886
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,140
- Shut up!
- He's still a child.

887
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,020
Don't touch my mother.

888
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,780
Why still snap at my mother?

889
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,220
Enough.

890
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,180
What are you doing?

891
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,100
What are you doing?

892
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,060
I, he, you...
