(Quiet and Beautiful, Bright and Fancy)

Have you found the tea leaves?

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,840
Yes.

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,610
What was the result?

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,770
Can't you see? He lost.

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,680
What... What tea won the first prize?

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,050
Luo Zhusi's Aji Tea.

34
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,770
This year's first prize

35
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,520
goes to Aji Tea

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,800
from Jinyu Tea.

37
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,460
(Anning Prefecture Tea Contest)

38
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,890
How come?

39
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,050
Maybe I was too reckless.

40
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,930
It was my fault.

41
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,240
Kan, don't blame yourself.

42
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,330
It's not your fault.

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,330
I heard they had bribed the authorities.

44
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
We didn't bribe them,

45
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,400
so we lost the game.

46
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,840
It's all right,

47
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,050
young man.

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,930
We're still young.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,680
Before we win,

50
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,520
the contest will never end.

51
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,960
But I made a bet with Luo Zhusi.

52
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,170
We'll have to leave our residence.

53
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,720
It's nothing.

54
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm fed up with living there.

55
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,390
This is a good chance

56
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,330
for us to travel around.

57
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,090
Do you really not mind?

58
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,240
No, of course.

59
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,930
Come on. I'll go buy you some noodles.

60
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,390
And two eggs.

61
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,650
Luo Zhusi will be jealous.

62
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,400
All right. I'll pay the bill.

63
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,120
You've moved on?

64
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm just getting emotional.

65
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm about to cry, but they've moved on?

66
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,930
Wait a minute.

67
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,890
You stole zongzi, right?

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,960
Did... Did you see that?

69
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,140
Don't... Don't stare at me.

70
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,300
Don't be ridiculous.

71
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,560
Did you catch me in the act?

72
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,950
If you didn't,

73
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,090
why did you complain?

74
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,960
What a psychopath.

75
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,350
Oh, I'm getting excited.

76
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,400
Come on. Stop over there.

77
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,740
Why?

78
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,700
Wait.

79
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,540
I'm telling you,

80
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,600
you didn't steal, then.

81
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,420
(Jing Residence)

82
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,450
Madam, we finally won the first prize.

83
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,820
We did, at last.

84
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,920
All right, all right.

85
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,140
Are you a parrot?

86
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,480
You've repeated it many times.

87
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,400
Now, I'm relieved.

88
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,710
People used to think

89
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,600
this was a family of tribute tea

90
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,670
because of Qin Baoyi,

91
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,250
the coquettish woman.

92
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,280
Now, it proves that you can also help.

93
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,420
And Qin Baoyi couldn't succeed

94
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,360
without Master's help.

95
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,350
You don't need that.

96
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,600
You've been all alone.

97
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,150
Nobody has cared about you.

98
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,490
- Come on.
- Only I'm...

99
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,840
Stop nagging.

100
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,920
At tomorrow's banquet,

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,810
you don't nag like this.

102
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,960
By then, clan relatives will come.

103
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,570
Tell Aji to get ready

104
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,650
for tomorrow's inauguration.

105
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,940
- Ms. Luo.
- I get it.

106
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,880
This is great.

107
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,480
You also know we won the Tea Contest?

108
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,550
No, no.

109
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,720
My master is back.

110
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,050
Mother.

111
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,360
I'm a really bad son.

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,900
(Jing Nanfeng, Wei Junyi's eldest son)

113
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,240
My son.

114
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,450
Get up now.

115
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,250
Get up.

116
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,570
All these years,

117
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,960
where have you been?

118
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,610
- Mother.
- Nanfeng.

119
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,760
Nan...

120
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,930
Zhusi.

121
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,570
You're back.

122
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,170
But we were told

123
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,480
your ship was wrecked

124
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,520
and nobody survived.

125
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Zhusi,

126
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,520
am... Am I mistaken?

127
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,680
No.

128
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,610
Mother,

129
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,060
our ship

130
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,090
did sink.

131
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,990
But some fishermen saved my life.

132
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,890
I wandered and ended up
on Qiongzhou Island.

133
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,150
In this case,

134
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,710
why didn't you send back a message?

135
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,650
Yeah.

136
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,000
All these years,

137
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,450
I... I thought you were...

138
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,820
I also didn't know

139
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,040
I could come back alive.

140
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,650
Glad you're back.

141
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,090
Glad you're back.

142
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,200
Sadly,

143
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,600
you didn't see your father
before he died.

144
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,970
Mother,

145
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,920
only after going through this

146
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,120
did I realize

147
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,130
I was sorry

148
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,650
for you and Father.

149
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,800
Don't worry.

150
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,290
I know I was wrong.

151
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,090
I won't do that anymore.

152
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,960
As long as you're alive,

153
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,040
Mother will be content.

154
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,760
Mother,

155
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,480
let me offer incense to Father.

156
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,340
(Zuixian Restaurant)

157
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,160
Didn't we have a deal?

158
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,600
When I give you fifty taels a month,

159
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,520
you'll live alone out there

160
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,960
and never come back.

161
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,360
Zhusi,

162
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,210
my health condition

163
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,840
has been worse and worse.

164
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,130
When I was young,

165
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,710
I didn't think anything could

166
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,130
be compared to gambling.

167
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,550
For gambling,

168
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,720
I could abandon anything.

169
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,450
But one day,

170
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,890
I witnessed the death of a friend.

171
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,330
When he was dying,

172
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,950
there was nobody

173
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,890
around him.

174
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,690
At that time, I realized

175
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,120
I still needed a home.

176
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,120
Do you think I'll believe that?

177
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,760
I don't care.

178
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,120
When I'm back here,

179
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,210
I'll tell you three things.

180
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,560
First,

181
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,600
I won't tell anyone

182
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,570
you didn't want me to come back.

183
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,680
Second,

184
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,190
I won't compete with you

185
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,990
for the position of the chief manager.

186
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,930
Third...

187
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,600
I will keep

188
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,440
your secret

189
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,290
about Luo Aji.

190
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,560
Well,

191
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,120
I have three things to say, too.

192
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,480
First,

193
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,210
it's not that I didn't want you back,

194
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,880
but because you and I

195
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,480
had a deal.

196
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,650
Second,

197
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,290
it's not that you won't compete

198
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,860
for that position.

199
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,570
You're just not good enough.

200
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,230
Third,

201
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,690
there's no secret about Aji.

202
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,290
I also hope

203
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,330
you won't think you can threaten me

204
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,170
with all this.

205
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,840
Zhusi,

206
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,450
don't get me wrong.

207
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,760
I know it's of no use to say anything.

208
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,320
But anyway,

209
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,530
as time goes by,

210
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,050
you will know.

211
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,250
Mingzhen.

212
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,020
Perfect timing.

213
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,230
Pack the teacups in Yanxia Chamber

214
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,170
and I'll take them away.

215
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,680
Here.

216
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,690
(Intoxicating Spring)
Where are you going?

217
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,440
I have to leave here.

218
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,930
Take care of Grandmother.

219
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,760
You're really leaving?

220
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,930
Just go.

221
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,530
Zhenzhu.

222
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,600
Zhenzhu.

223
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,960
I washed some fruit for you.

224
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,130
I don't want that.

225
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,560
Zhenzhu,

226
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,960
don't ignore Father.

227
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,530
Uncle, what's wrong with Zhenzhu?

228
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,130
Nothing.

229
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,290
I did many foolish things before.

230
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,840
It's normal

231
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,200
that she ignores me.

232
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,330
It's all right. Glad you're back.

233
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,110
I heard you did very well

234
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,050
in the Tea Contest.

235
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,480
I feel happy for you.

236
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,240
I lost, anyway.

237
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,930
I made a bet with Luo Zhusi.

238
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,210
I have to leave home now.

239
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,410
Leave?

240
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,900
Even a family

241
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,050
shouldn't have had that bet.

242
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,740
Forget it. What's gone is gone.

243
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,000
This is ridiculous.

244
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,160
You won't go anywhere.

245
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,010
I'll talk to them.

246
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,620
- Take this.
- But Uncle...

247
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,500
I will be back.

248
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,370
Don't go anywhere.

249
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,230
No need, Uncle.

250
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,170
Uncle.

251
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,860
Today, I saw how Zhenzhu

252
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,810
treated Uncle.

253
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,360
I think it's really hard for him.

254
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,330
But I do understand Zhenzhu.

255
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,380
Uncle did so many bad things to her.

256
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,760
She wouldn't just forgive him.

257
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,260
I think Uncle has changed a lot

258
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,290
when he's back here.

259
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,000
Looks like one will figure out a lot

260
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,570
after he's nearly dead.

261
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,130
We're a family, after all.

262
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,930
Family members forgive each other.

263
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,000
That depends.

264
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,230
A gambler

265
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,880
can hardly give up gambling.

266
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,690
We should be careful, anyway.

267
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,810
When I think

268
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,330
we're moving out tomorrow,

269
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,650
I feel quite reluctant.

270
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,360
How about I move out alone?

271
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,530
You can stay here.

272
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,900
Sounds good.

273
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,880
I won't get packed, then.

274
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,600
You're angry?

275
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,880
I was just kidding.

276
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,900
Don't you know that saying?

277
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,960
"A woman always follows her husband.

278
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,360
What if Kan is her husband?

279
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,930
She sticks to him."

280
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,860
I've got a plan.

281
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,900
After we move out,

282
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,060
I'll rent a house

283
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,020
with a storefront.

284
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,660
We sell tea and live there.

285
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,180
What about Anping Bridge Shop?

286
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,300
We lost, right?

287
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,660
So, we will give it back

288
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,660
to Jinyu Tea.

289
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,660
If I remember correctly,

290
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,100
what you said was

291
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,020
you would leave here if you lost.

292
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,900
You didn't say you would

293
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,060
return the shop to them.

294
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,460
I didn't?

295
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,860
I support you to pay your bet.

296
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
But I won't agree

297
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,780
to pay anything else.

298
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,300
So, I had something

299
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,260
in reserve.

300
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,460
That's right.

301
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,900
So, we just need to move out.

302
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,740
But will people think

303
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,780
we're playing a trick?

304
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,180
In this case,

305
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,780
we need some tricks.

306
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,020
All right.

307
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,220
You get some rest.

308
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,620
I'm not tired.

309
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,780
Let me give you a massage.

310
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,020
No need.

311
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,100
I can do it.

312
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,780
You've had a hard time these years.

313
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,660
Let me do it.

314
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,500
I... I...

315
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,620
Sit down.

316
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,860
Nanfeng.

317
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,700
You're no longer what you used to be.

318
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,780
Before,

319
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,780
I was foolish and childish.

320
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,940
When I'm back,

321
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,900
I'll make it up to you and Zhenzhu.

322
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,660
I'll always take care of you.

323
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,900
Don't drink too much wine anymore.

324
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,100
I... I mean...

325
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,540
That's good for your health.

326
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,660
You're right.

327
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,540
Getting drunk leads to disasters

328
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,060
and it is too late for regrets.

329
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,500
Dear.

330
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,100
Sit down.

331
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,620
Zhenzhu still ignores you?

332
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,940
It's all my fault.

333
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,220
She isn't to blame.

334
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,700
At that time,

335
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,980
I was too childish

336
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,460
and foolish.

337
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,220
But now, I'm back.

338
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,460
You and I will make this family happy.

339
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,580
Oh,

340
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,020
do you know

341
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,620
where Mother keeps the account books?

342
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,380
Account books?

343
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,140
Why do you ask?

344
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,300
Nothing.

345
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,300
Do you know Luo Aji's secret?

346
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,220
What's his secret?

347
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,940
He's Luo Zhusi's illegitimate son.

348
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,300
What?

349
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,420
Luo... Luo Zhusi...

350
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,460
Illegitimate son?

351
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,780
Are you sure?

352
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,580
My brother knew it a long time ago.

353
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,420
But he was just too kind

354
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,420
to embarrass Zhusi.

355
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,940
This time,

356
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,220
she used Aji Tea

357
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,460
as the name of the tribute tea.

358
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,820
I'm afraid she has schemes

359
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,340
against Jinyu Tea.

360
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,100
Well, what you're saying

361
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,580
sounds reasonable.

362
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,700
I'm just worried

363
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,820
she may have fooled Mother

364
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,340
when I was away.

365
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
But don't tell others

366
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,580
about Luo Aji's secret.

367
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,340
I don't want Zhusi

368
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,580
to have a hard time here.

369
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,460
Fine.

370
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,020
(Yuming Chamber)

371
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,940
Grandmother,

372
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,180
under such circumstances,

373
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,100
Sixi and I

374
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,460
will leave here in a day or two.

375
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,570
Hope you'll take care.

376
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,380
Grandmother, take care.

377
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,140
Don't be so stubborn.

378
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,580
Why must you leave?

379
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,620
Last night, your uncle just asked you

380
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,100
not to leave.

381
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,660
This family has just reunited.

382
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,540
Can't you

383
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,820
let me enjoy

384
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,980
a couple of comfortable days?

385
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,580
Jing Kan,

386
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,780
I made a bet with you

387
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
because I wanted you

388
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,660
to make better tea.

389
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,980
Now, my purpose has been achieved.

390
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,660
Don't take our bet

391
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,620
so seriously.

392
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,060
I always keep my word.

393
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,260
I proposed the bet,

394
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,180
so I will pay for that.

395
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,500
Grandmother,

396
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,580
we will often come back for you.

397
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
Come on, Jing Kan.

398
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,660
Why are you so stubborn?

399
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,500
We're a family.

400
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,620
If you stay, nobody will complain.

401
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,260
- Yeah.
- Let me see who will complain.

402
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,580
Auntie.

403
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,870
Grandmother.

404
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,730
Mother.

405
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,860
Jing Kan just

406
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,100
can't get over it.

407
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,140
Don't bother to persuade him.

408
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
My Lady!

409
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,580
What's up?

410
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,580
- My Lady.
- Don't panic.

411
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,180
Lord Pei is here.

412
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,660
Lord Pei?

413
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,100
(Yuming Chamber)
Welcome, Lord Pei.

414
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,180
To what do we owe this pleasure?

415
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,020
Ms. Wei,

416
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,340
sorry for this unexpected visit.

417
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,940
Actually,

418
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,060
I'm here for Jing Kan.

419
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,300
Anzhou Sweetie

420
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,260
failed to be the tribute tea.

421
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,860
But what you said yesterday

422
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,820
really impressed me.

423
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,980
A talented young man like you

424
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,900
will have a promising future.

425
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,580
You flatter me, milord.

426
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,260
I want you to do me a favor.

427
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,820
What is it?

428
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,180
Please go on

429
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,380
developing Anzhou Sweetie.

430
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,900
Why?

431
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,700
I want to present it

432
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,180
to His Majesty.

433
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,460
Once His Majesty approves it,

434
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,260
the future of Jinyu Tea

435
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,380
will be very promising.

436
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,660
But there is still room

437
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,180
for the improvement of its flavor.

438
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,060
Hope you'll contribute
to "diversified tea brands"

439
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,340
as you mentioned.

440
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
So, tell me.

441
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,940
What do you think?

442
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,180
Milord,

443
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,180
this is our duty.

444
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,540
If we can

445
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,860
make a little contribution

446
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,420
for His Majesty,

447
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,900
we will be really honored.

448
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,500
Jing Kan,

449
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,740
say thank you.

450
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,300
Thank you, milord.

451
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,340
Ms. Wei,

452
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,140
I should go, then.

453
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,980
See you.

454
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,940
Bye.

455
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,580
Let me walk you out.

456
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,100
Will you still leave?

457
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,180
If you still insist,

458
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,340
you'll be really disobedient.

459
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,180
Yeah, Jing Kan.

460
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,940
This family needs you.

461
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,980
Jinyu Tea needs you, too.

462
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,780
Or do you

463
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,580
want me to beg you?

464
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,420
Jing Kan.

465
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,540
Jing Kan.

466
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,660
I know.

467
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,260
If you have to stay like this,

468
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,140
you won't

469
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
get over it.

470
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,500
You lost the bet

471
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,180
and you should pay the price.

472
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,380
How about this?

473
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,980
I'll be a peacemaker.

474
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,180
From this day on,

475
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,140
Anzhou Sweetie

476
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,500
won't only be sold in your shop,

477
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,860
but in all the other shops

478
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,940
of Jinyu Tea.

479
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,020
In this way,

480
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,220
people will see

481
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,180
we're united as one

482
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,980
and they'll know you are

483
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,060
a man of his word.

484
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,660
Moreover, we can work together

485
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,140
against the fierce competition

486
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,420
from Laolongtan Tea.

487
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,220
What do you guys think?

488
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,860
Zhusi, what do you say?

489
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,180
You call the shots, Mother.

490
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,900
All right. Let's do this.

491
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,540
(Jail)

492
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,700
Wang,

493
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,260
are you all right?

494
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,260
Where's Zhusi?

495
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,820
Madam hasn't come.

496
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,100
Look at you.

497
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,500
Even if you tried to help,

498
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,060
you shouldn't have kidnapped others.

499
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,500
Oh no.

500
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,740
I must go and explain to her.

501
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,820
No need.

502
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,660
You're fired.

503
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,820
What?

504
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,220
I'm fired?

505
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,340
Yes.

506
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,900
Is it so serious?

507
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,420
Of course.

508
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,900
You did something terrible.

509
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,900
You think you can still be a manager?

510
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,900
Madam sent you to the tea plantation

511
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
to assist Liu.

512
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,100
Look at you.

513
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,260
You've lost weight.

514
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,820
Come on. I'll buy you nice food.

515
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,180
You go alone.

516
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,580
Here's the money.

517
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,500
Keep the change.

518
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,020
All right. See you.

519
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,140
How could you do that to me?

520
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,620
I have to be merciless, then.

521
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,300
(Jing Residence)

522
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,260
What's wrong?

523
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,100
I'm upset.

524
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,540
Right.

525
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,580
Since Mr. Jing returned,

526
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,700
he hasn't asked to work for Jinyu Tea.

527
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,580
Neither has Old Lady.

528
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,500
I guess

529
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
they must be up to something.

530
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,780
Now,

531
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,420
Aji's work in Jinyu Tea

532
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,460
remains a distant possibility.

533
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,500
Madam,

534
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,180
let's not worry too much.

535
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,740
Only we know

536
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,700
how to make Aji Tea.

537
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,300
I don't think Jing Nanfeng

538
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,620
can stir up too much trouble.

539
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,420
It's not as simple as you say.

540
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,980
What's wrong?

541
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,940
Nothing. I just feel dizzy.

542
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,820
I haven't slept very well.

543
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,860
I have a lot of nightmares.

544
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,780
Nightmares?

545
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,180
Is there anything wrong with the bed?

546
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,340
Mr. Jing has changed

547
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,260
when he's back.

548
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,140
Every night, he washes
his mother's feet.

549
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,740
Now, his family

550
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,180
can count on him.

551
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,500
Think about Mingxia.

552
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,860
Her spine has even stiffened.

553
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,340
I feel something is wrong with Uncle.

554
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,660
He's good, isn't he?

555
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,900
He even helped you to stay.

556
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,260
He gave you a way out.

557
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,540
I just think he pretends

558
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,740
to be kind and caring.

559
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,980
Is he having a scheme

560
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,580
against Jing Kan?

561
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,580
Any proof?

562
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,980
No.

563
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,580
That's why I'm talking to you here.

564
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,740
To me?

565
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,900
You think I can figure it out?

566
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,380
For eating and drinking,

567
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,420
I may give you some advice.

568
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,740
But judging people...

569
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,460
I failed once, you know.

570
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,820
Let's leave it there.

571
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,180
How have you been lately?

572
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,040
Me?

573
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,340
I'm fine.

574
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,980
You can still drink that much?

575
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,380
I can always drink that much.

576
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,900
Why do you ask?

577
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,220
Nothing.

578
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,660
I just want to get some evidence

579
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,260
through your drinking.

580
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,820
Come on, No. 357.

581
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,780
The longer I know you,

582
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,860
the more I think people are scheming.

583
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,260
Fine. I'll just get to the point.

584
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,060
I'm thinking

585
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,420
if you can drink with Uncle

586
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
and get him drunk.

587
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,100
Then, I'll ask him something.

588
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,740
Let me be frank.

589
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
I've never lost

590
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,660
at drinking wine.

591
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,740
Come on.

592
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,820
Speaking of drinking...

593
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,780
The wine at home is the best.

594
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,460
It is, huh? I totally agree.

595
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,460
Recently, I've been drinking all alone.

596
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,780
Now, you're back, Nanfeng.

597
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,500
I finally have a drinking partner.

598
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,220
Grandaunt,

599
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,580
don't say that.

600
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,940
Whenever you want to drink,

601
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,340
let me know.

602
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,180
All right.

603
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,300
But now,

604
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,500
I'm getting old.

605
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,900
I can't drink

606
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,180
as much as before.

607
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,100
When we drink,

608
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Grandaunt,

609
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,180
hope you'll go easy on me.

610
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,380
Don't say that.

611
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,620
We're a family.

612
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,260
How about this?

613
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,060
I'll finish it in one gulp.

614
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,380
You'll finish it in two.

615
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,100
All right.

616
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
How about this?

617
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,420
I have one drink in one gulp

618
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,700
and you have two?

619
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,500
No problem. Let's drink.

620
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,940
Oh no. How much did she drink?

621
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,420
Mingnan.

622
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,060
Where's Uncle?

623
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,980
He said

624
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,620
they didn't enjoy enough wine.

625
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,470
So, he went out

626
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,620
to drink with his friends.

627
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,740
All right. I get it.

Are you all right?

631
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,660
How many drinks can I have in one gulp?

632
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,340
She's so drunk.

633
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,660
Let's go.

634
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,340
Get back to sleep.

635
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,100
Come on, let's go.

636
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,340
Come on.

637
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,380
It makes my eyes sting.

638
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,940
Come on. One, two, go.

639
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,460
Be careful.

640
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,940
Move, move.

641
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
Be very careful.

642
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,340
Oh my goodness.

643

00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,820
I'm fine.

645
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,940
What have you got from him?

646
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,940
This guy is

647
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,260
unfathomable,

649

I'm going to the privy.

654
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,980
When you're drunk, you have a rhyme.

655
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,300
Can you go alone?

656
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,420
- Be careful.
- Rise.

657
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,340

Yes.

search for new teas,

and write a Book of New Tea.

Will you go with me?

706
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,660

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,140
I have true feelings for you.

766
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Kidnapping, killing,

767
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,500
and scheming.

768
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,180
You call that "true feelings"?

769
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,620
But I did all those things

770
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,300
just for you.

771
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,220
Enough.

772
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,140
From this day on,

773
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,620
you must not

774
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,180
enter this shop.

775
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,620
If Cuiying hadn't pleaded for you,

776
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,980
you would still be in prison.

777
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,180
Now, get out.

778
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,780
Out.

779
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,300
Where are you going?

780
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,580
Who said you could touch me?

781
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,020
What happened?

782
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,460
None of your business.

783
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,460
Why are you so angry for no reason?

784
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
I bought you breakfast.

785
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,540
Let's go and have it.

786
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,500
Don't touch me.

787
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,420
Don't follow me.

788
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Do you understand?

789
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,380
Do not follow me.

790
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,180
I made you soup for dinner.

791
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,420
Come back early for it.

792
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,900
Why do you laugh?

793
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,060
Why do you make soup for me?

794
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,180
And you try to be cute.

795
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,740
You must be insane!

796
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,180
What are you looking at?

797
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,140
No one shall tell others.

798
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,580
- Yes.
- Yes.
