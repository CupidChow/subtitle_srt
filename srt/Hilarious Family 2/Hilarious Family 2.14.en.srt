What are you doing here?

You're awake, huh?

28
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,650
I'm not.

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,230
What do you want?

30
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,680
This is what I want to ask you.

31
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,260
Without saying a word,

32
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,680
you came over to me.

33
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,610
A mother needn't say anything

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,490
before visiting her daughter.

35
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,400
It makes sense.

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,580
When you left your daughter

37
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,830
to travel around the world,

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,120
you didn't say a word, either.

39
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,050
I didn't?

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,770
I didn't say a word?

41
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,650
Are you out of money again?

42
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,960
Don't say that.

43
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,170
This time, I really missed you.

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,720
I really did.

45
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,800
You missed me?

46
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,170
Come on.

47
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,610
Your...

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,830
Your sweetheart.

49
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,050
Mr. Guo, right?

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,680
Where is he?

51
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,960
You said he was one in a million.

52
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,300
What happened?

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,240
Did you break up?

54
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,080
Guo...

55
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,680
He's a nice man.

56
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,520
But he isn't romantic.

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,420
Instead of hairpins or tassels

58
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,890
that are sold everywhere,

59
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,560
he bought me a pair of socks.

60
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,420
People want their lives

61
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,070
to be romantic and exciting.

62
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,010
Don't you think so?

63
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,890
Look at you.

64
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,070
You look really plain.

65
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,490
How could you come out like this?

66
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,350
Have you never tried

67
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,460
rouge, makeup powder,

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,390
or eyebrow paint

69
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,330
since you were born?

70
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,280
How is that possible?

71
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,120
Look at his. And this.

72
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,280
What are you trying to say?

73
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,930
Give me some money.
I'll buy them for you.

74
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,930
Mai Youyou.

75
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,490
Let me make this clear.

76
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm no longer doing

77
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,640
the inn business.

78
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,280
I have no money for you.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,700
That's good.

80
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,020
You've married a rich man.

81
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,650
Don't always stay out there.

82
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,510
How did you

83
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,050
meet Mr. Jing?

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,240
Don't be so curious.

85
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,550
I'm not curious.

86
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,010
I'm caring for you.

87
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,330
What was your bride price?

88
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,250
Nothing.

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,150
Don't lie to me.

90
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,910
I think you only care about money.

91
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,520
I only care about you.

92
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,820
Or why didn't I ask others

93
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,960
about their bride price?

94
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,560
Let me say something intimate.

95
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,890
Have a baby soon.

96
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,150
Then you'll stick in this family

97
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,520
and I'll be relieved.

98
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,300
Right.

99
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,240
Good idea.

100
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,720
I'm going to have some babies now.

101
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,130
Where can I have breakfast?

102
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,250
In Yushi Chamber.

103
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,690
Yushi Chamber.

104
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,760
You.

105
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes, you.

106
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,400
Yes. Come over here.

107
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,880
Who are you?

108
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,840
Let me introduce myself.

109
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,360
I am

110
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,960
Jing Kan's mother.

111
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,770
Here's the thing.

112
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,520
You're a maid here, right?

113
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,360
Yes, huh?

114
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,030
Later, go to the South Market

115
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,180
and buy me two fruit-stuffed jelly cakes

116
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,090
and sugared ice cream balls.

117
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,030
Remember. Two spoons of sugar.

118
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,500
A bit more or less isn't fine.

119
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,450
Western sugar, please.

120
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,150
Besides,

121
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,620
if there is extra rouge, makeup powder,

122
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,790
and eyebrow paint,

123
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,110
give me some.

124
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,160
If there isn't, buy me some.

125
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,320
Thank you for that.

126
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,600
Is that the place for breakfast?

127
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,150
Forget it. It's nothing.

128
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,280
I'll make my way around.

129
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,440
Bye.

130
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,480
Jing Kan's mother?

131
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,480
How many mothers does he have?

132
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,240
Madam.

133
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,490
Chief,

134
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,650
I've found out what Jing Kan cares for.

135
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,240
What is that?

136
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,890
A man.

137
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,930
Who?

138
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,360
Oh, my head hurts.

139
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,360
Ruan Ling.

140
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,130
It's all over the tea plantation.

141
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,420
Because his subordinate

142
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,130
gave Ruan Ling a few more bowls of food,

143
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,770
Jing Kan flew into a rage.

144
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,110
What does that mean?

145
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,050
It means...

146
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,240
Get to the point.

147
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,600
It means they have a thing

148
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,010
with each other.

149
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,680
What thing?

150
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,720
Anyway, he cares for Ruan Ling.

151
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,210
Why would he care for Ruan Ling?

152
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,400
Because he's flattering.

153
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,380
Ruan Ling

154
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,210
is rather smooth-tongued.

155
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,570
He always flatters people.

156
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,330
So, he is...

157
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,730
A pleaser.

158
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,960
Shouldn't he be a flatterer?

159
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,130
Everybody knows this word.

160
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,260
I want to be the man

161
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,010
who surprises people.

162
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,380
I can't believe

163
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,160
Jing Kan hit me so hard.

164
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
Then I'll make him

165
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,620
care more about the man he cares for.

166
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,740
I'd like to see

167
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,860
what's special about this guy

168
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,570
he's caring for.

169
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,440
Somebody come.

170
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,210
Bring me the pleaser.

171
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,930
Yes.

172
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,010
Mr. Jing wanted to see you.

173
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,500
I'm not going.

174
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,470
If he wants to talk,

175
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,410
he can come here.

176
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,490
Get him.

177
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,770
What are you doing?

178
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,090
Plenty to do, huh?

179
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,570
It's really a lovely room.

180
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,240
Chief, here he is.

181
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,960
Where's your master?

182
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,050
Master?

183
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,240
Don't tell me it's Jing Kan.

184
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,450
You're showing off.

185
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,500
Oh, look. Your intention

186
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,440
is quite obvious.

187
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,810
Yes. We'll mess with Jing Kan.

188
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,050
But sadly,

189
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,960
you have no time to inform him.

190
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,050
There must be some mistake.

191
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,990
If you want to mess with Jing Kan,

192
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,290
just go ahead.

193
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,990
If you want to slap him,

194
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,170
I can even do that for you.

195
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,050
He's trying to warn Jing Kan, right?

196
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,890
You don't seem to listen.

197
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,640
He's a perfect pleaser.

198
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,020
Pleaser?

199
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,120
A man who pleases people.

200
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,880
Why did you slap me?

201
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,720
Because we don't like Jing Kan.

202
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,410
Then you should slap him!

203
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,740
As his pleaser,

204
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,960
you have to pay a price, too.

205
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,840
Don't call me that!

206
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,660
This is too much.

207
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,500
It really is.

208
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,450
How about this?

209
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,840
You let me go

210
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,860
and I can help you

211
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,120
to lure Jing Kan here.

212
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,000
Try to get a helper, huh?

213
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,530
Fine. You need your master.

214
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,950
How about this?

215
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,430
If you bark like a dog several times,

216
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,530
I'll go get your master.

217
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,840
Isn't it funny?

218
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,480
It's so humorous of you.

219
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,880
Did I say you could laugh?

220
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,320
Go ahead.

221
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,530
Bark.

222
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,090
Bark.

223
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,370
I...

224
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,430
- You...
- Ruan Ling.

225
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,370
Bark.

226
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,210
His master is here for him.

227
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,800
What are you doing?

228
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,050
Slapping your servant.

229
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,530
You're being humorous again.

230
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,600
That's going too far!

231
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,500
Sit back.

232
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,540
We sit too close.

233
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,430
Sit back there.

234
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,600
I don't want this.

235
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,710
Sit back.

236
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,830
Let me stay away from him.

237
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,770
Just sit back.

238
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,840
You used to be fierce, huh?

239
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,330
Quite impressive.

240
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,290
Ares of the Privy, right?

241
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,330
Previously,

242
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,880
you made a fool of me.

243
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,360
I'll chop off your hand each.

244
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,690
Is it too much?

245
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,130
Take both of my hands.

246
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,170
But let him go.

247
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,600
Are you insane?

248
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,000
Wait a minute.

249
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,570
Did you figure it out?

250
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,600
Chief, what do they mean?

251
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,720
I'll kill both of you, then.

252
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,880
What's the noise?

253
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,780
Who was that?

254
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,720
I don't know.

255
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,050
Go lock the door.

256
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,200
Alright.

257
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,070
Don't move.

258
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,950
- Head in hands!
- Squat.

259
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,800
I'm talking to you.

260
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,350
Don't move. Head in hands.

261
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,260
Get down.

262
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,120
Behave.

263
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,760
How dare you keep weapons illegally?

264
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,330
You think I'm dead?

265
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,740
We're saved.

266
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,110
Take all these guys away.

267
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,360
Take them away.

268
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,720
Don't move!

269
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,380
Are you blind?

270
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,640
We're the victims!

271
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,380
It's you again.

272
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,480
Sir, we were just joking.

273
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Don't worry.

274
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,710
I'm here. You're safe.

275
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,880
- Alright.
- Come on.

276
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,190
- Mr. Jing.
- Thank you.

277
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,130
Come, please.

278
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,830
- He's still there.
- Let's go.

279
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,990
Mr. Lei.

280
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,360
I'm still here!

281
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,260
Behave!

282
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,200
Mr. Lei.

283
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,480
Don't touch me!

284
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,000
You're the pleaser!

285
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,650
Sir, untie me, please.

286
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,000
Here, Mr. Jing.

287
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,640
Thank you for helping me out.

288
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,960
I didn't do that for nothing.

289
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,240
You're the eldest child
of Jinyu Tea, right?

290
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,170
Yes.

291
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,600
I've been in this field for a long time

292
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,600
and had many friends
in the tea business.

293
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,050
They have a lot of fancy tea leaves.

294
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,290
The quality is guaranteed.

295
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,120
They just don't know how to sell them.

296
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm wondering if you can sell the tea

297
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,570
in your own shop.

298
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,570
Give it a name as you wish.

299
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,410
The profits will go fifty-fifty.

300
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,930
No need.

301
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,250
I'll take 20 percent.

302
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,210
Please buy better food

303
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,140
for the workers

304
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,110
in this tea plantation

305
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,120
with the other 30 percent.

306
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,290
Impressive.

307
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,770
Impressive, indeed.

308
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,120
Since you agree to sell the tea,

309
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,570
you'll be contributing.

310
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,740
I'll reduce your time.

311
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,680
You can leave tomorrow.

312
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,470
I can leave tomorrow?

313
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,410
Why would I lie?

314
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,480
The tea leaves can't wait.

315
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,930
Supervisor Lei,

316
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,360
I have another condition.

317
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,880
Not on the price.

318
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,170
No.

319
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,720
I want to take Ruan Ling away.

320
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,660
I don't know

321
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,210
how Jing Kan is doing there.

322
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,250
Come on.

323
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,930
Be careful.

324
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,050
Come on. Put it over here.

325
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,530
Right over here.

326
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,330
Alright. We should go.

327
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,430
Whose halter tops?

328
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,720
Why are they here?

329
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,960
Who do you think owns them?

330
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,780
You?

331
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,620
Your mother.

332
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,560
Your...

333
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,770
My mother?

334
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,120
Where is she now?

335
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,320
In Yushi Chamber.

336
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,620
She got herself a welcome banquet

337
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,690
and invited everybody over.

338
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,710
Sixteen dishes.

339
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,690
Two menus, actually.

340
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,530
Come on. Move aside.

341
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,080
Let's drink.

342
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,180
This is a family

343
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,410
of widows.

344
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,810
Mother, what are you doing here?

345
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,500
What's the fuss?

346
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,840
Greet them.

347
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,960
Grandmother. Auntie.

348
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm terribly sorry.

349
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,900
This is my mother, Mai Youyou.

350
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,830
She always

351
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,780
talks very casually.

352
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
Sixi,

353
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,050
you and Jing Kan
have been married for so long.

354
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,330
We didn't see your mother until today.

355
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,360
It's your fault.

356
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,470
Yeah.

357
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,020
Sixi, your mother

358
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,000
is insightful from traveling around.

359
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,570
And she's humorous.

360
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,640
Let's have a deal.

361
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,240
Without my permission,

362
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,530
you must not leave.

363
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,430
Come on, My Lady.

364
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,310
I can't stay at my son-in-law's place.

365
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,050
That's not appropriate.

366
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,760
Now sit.

367
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,470
You're well prepared.

368
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,310
When have I ever

369
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,250
disgraced you?

370
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,960
You must be Jing Kan's mother.

371
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,710
Who's she?

372
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm meeting you at last.

373
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,050
Fine.

374
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,470
- Come on.
- Alright.

375
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,070
- Be seated.
- Alright.

376
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,110
You don't have to do this.

377
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,810
We haven't met before.

378
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,360
That's Madam's spot.

379
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,880
It doesn't make a difference.

380
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,930
Come on.

381
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,000
She must be your personal maid.

382
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,360
She's really diligent.

383
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,480
You've trained her very well.

384
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,130
Ms. Luo,

385
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,760
I should drink for our first meeting.

386
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,530
Oh, Mother.

387
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,930
I suddenly remember

388
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,380
I have something to deal with.

389
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,320
I'll take my leave.

390
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,310
What could be more important

391
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,470
than meeting Sixi's mother?

392
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,360
- Yeah.
- Sit down and drink.

393
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,710
Sit now.

394
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,480
It's fine. She doesn't have to drink.

395
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,880
Just make yourself comfortable.

396
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,360
Come on.

397
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,190
Let's drink.

398
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,590
Come on. The two of us

399
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,020
and this younger lady

400
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,880
shall wish Old Lady longevity.

401
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,050
Raise your cup.

402
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,040
Who's the younger lady?

403
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,400
You.

404
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,770
Wow, you think I'm younger?

405
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,290
No one else has ever seen it.

406
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,100
I thought you were younger than me.

407
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Others think I'm older

408
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,920
because my husband is the eldest son.

409
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,840
Come on.

410
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,780
Here.

411
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,780
Let's wish her

412
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,360
a harmonious and prosperous family.

413
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,490
Glad to hear that.

414
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,240
I feel so good.

415
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,640
You're Sixi's mother-in-law.

416
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,780
They wouldn't exist without you.

417
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,970
They should respect you.

418
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,770
And we should

419
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,840
take good care of you, My Lady.

420
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,650
Mother,

421
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,330
in this family,

422
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,600
there are always rules.

423
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,360
One must behave

424
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,120
very properly.

425
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,490
I'm sorry.

426
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,680
Put them back.

427
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,240
On my shoulders.

428
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,680
Someone can finally drink with me

429
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,300
and we can finally laugh.

430
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,770
Does it bother you?

431
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,530
Ms. Luo,

432
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,360
another toast to you.

433
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,770
Thank you

434
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,870
for raising Jing Kan.

435
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,400
He's a great son-in-law for me.

436
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,770
Oh, I remember.

437
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,430
I have something important to handle.

438
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,730
Mother, enjoy the food.

439
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,040
I'll take my leave.

440
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,130
What's wrong with her?

441
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,880
Jing Kan isn't her biological son.

442
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,970
You should have told me.

443
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,100
Ignore her.

444
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,190
Let's drink.

445
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,020
- Come on.
- Let's enjoy ourselves.

446
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,290
Cheers.

447
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,340
Do you feel happy?

448
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,280
I do.

449
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,020
(Vast and Clear)

450
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,970
Drink slowly.

451
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,190
Auntie,

452
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,670
this is the amber bracelet

453
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,640
from my mother.

454
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,120
And this is the treasure pot

455
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,920
from my father.

456
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,540
This is the black-dragon incense

457
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,480
from my grandparents.

458
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,260
And here's some goat-milk pastry.

459
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,530
Who is it from?

460
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,050
It's from me.

461
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,330
Don't worry. No lard is in it.

462
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,020
My mother finally told me

463
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,400
you didn't eat anything with lard.

464
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,400
Why didn't you tell me before?

465
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,150
It was an old habit.

466
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,010
I occasionally eat some now.

467
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,340
You can just tell me

468
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,770
about something like this.

469
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,290
Don't endure discomfort.

470
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,670
Aji,

471
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,710
you had a long trip.

472
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,970
Go back for some rest.

473
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,340
Off you go.

474
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,280
Alright.

475
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,290
Am I interrupting, Ms. Luo?

476
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,880
You must be Jing Kan.

477
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,930
I'm not.

478
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,090
So, he's your son.

479
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,600
You look alike.

480
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,760
Don't be ridiculous.

481
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,090
This is my auntie.

482
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,650
What a woman.

483
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,400
Aji, have a good rest.

484
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,190
Go check

485
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,340
if his room is ready.

486
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,280
Yes.

487
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,890
I...

488
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,500
I really thought it was your son.

489
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,400
The two of you look alike.

490
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,090
What do you want me for?

491
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,120
Ms. Luo,

492
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,840
I talked carelessly

493
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,160
and offended you.

494
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,580
Don't take it personally.

495
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,770
I'm here to apologize.

496
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,040
It's nothing.

497
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,120
But remember.

498
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,330
Aji isn't my son.

499
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,840
He's my nephew.

500
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,200
I'll keep that in mind.

501
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,640
I'm just straightforward.

502
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,730
Anything else?

503
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,440
If you don't mind,

504
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,930
please leave.

505
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,920
Ms. Luo, we'll be friends.

506
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,820
If anything bothers you,

507
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,780
let me know.

508
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,120
I'll comfort you.

509
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,330
Nothing bothers me.

510
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,640
But you, Ms. Mai.

511
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,250
When you have time,

512
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,770
you can go out for a stroll.

513
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,190
You don't need

514
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,640
to be stuck in this house.

515
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,850
I get it.

516
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,490
Cuiying, see her out.

517
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,060
She isn't even here.

518
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,530
Why did you call her?

519
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,090
I'll see myself out.

520
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,680
You don't have to playact.

521
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,760
Bye.

522
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,010
What an ignorant woman.

523
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,200
What's wrong with you?

524
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,490
You can't even buy a ticket.

525
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,160
My Lady,

526
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,540
too many people were there today.

527
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,530
So what?

528
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm old, all right?

529
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,160
How many more times

530
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,880
can I watch Yunzhu's opera?

531
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,650
My Lady.

532
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,580
There you are.

533
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,770
What's going on?

534
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,020
I was sent

535
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,630
to buy a ticket for Yunzhu's opera,

536
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,680
but I failed.

537
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,960
Yunzhu?

538
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,330
The opera singer?

539
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,600
Yes.

540
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,680
Don't laugh.

541
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,950
Here's your tea.

542
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,890
Thank you.

543
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,240
Youyou,

544
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,640
where have you been all these years?

545
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,970
After we rowed a boat on Shigui Lake,

546
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,440
I lost contact with you.

547
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,500
In these dozen years,

548
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,010
I've been thinking of you.

549
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,890
Youyou,

550
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,280
who is this?

551
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,680
The owner of Huichun Opera House.

552
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,770
My Lady,

553
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,290
I'm Chen from Huichun Opera House.

554
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,540
Chen.

555
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,570
Let me be frank.

556
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,190
Try to get some tickets

557
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,680
for Yunzhu's opera.

558
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,680
But...

559
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,050
Youyou, to be honest,

560
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,990
it's really hard

561
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,970
to have Master Yunzhu sing

562
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,770
at my place.

563
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,060
So, the tickets...

564
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,000
Fine.

565
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,440
The door is over there.

566
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,970
You may leave now.

567
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,170
Youyou.

568
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,890
Let me think.

569
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,890
Oh, I remember.

570
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,290
I do have one ticket.

571
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,580
I had planned

572
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,360
to keep it
for Magistrate Meng's daughter.

573
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,090
I'll give it to you, then.

574
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,540
Alright.

575
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,480
No.

576
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,000
I need two.

577
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,090
Two...

578
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,910
Will you let her

579
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,850
go there alone?

580
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,020
She needs

581
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,160
a companion.

582
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,240
Fine.

583
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,250
I'll find another way.

584
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,570
Besides,

585
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,160
the seats must be adjacent.

586
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,870
If you get the tickets ready,

587
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,400
come here for lunch tomorrow.

588
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,640
If you fail,

589
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,840
you won't see me ever again.

590
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,520
Don't.

591
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,130
Fine.

592
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,260
I will try hard

593
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,680
to have lunch here tomorrow.

594
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,610
I'm on it now.

595
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,870
I'll take my leave, My Lady.

596
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,010
I'm on it now.

597
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,330
Mingzhen.

598
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,520
See...

599
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,760
Chen.

600
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,290
See Mr. Chen out.

601
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,130
This way, please.

602
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,960
Youyou.

603
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,290
Why is he so obedient to you?

604
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,820
You can totally

605
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,810
manipulate him.

606
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,730
Impressive, indeed.

607
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,820
We were friends years ago.

608
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,760
It's not worth telling.

609
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,260
Don't worry

610
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,200
if he offers no tickets.

611
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,970
We'll go straight to Yunzhu.

612
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,520
Who?

613
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,570
Yunzhu.

614
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,050
You even know him?

615
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,250
Do you really adore him that much?

616
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,850
I do.

617
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,640
Look, I'm old.

618
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,050
I love his operas most.

619
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,640
I want this house to be lively.

620
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,290
Don't laugh at me.

621
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,200
I won't.

622
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,290
You're just trying to be happy.

623
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,360
Oh, look.

624
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,880
It's so sweet of you.

625
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,810
Since you like Yunzhu that much,

626
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,920
I'll invite him over for lunch.

627
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,290
Are you sure?

628
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,010
My Lady,

629
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,090
we need some fun in the house.

630
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,050
Think about Ms. Luo.

631
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,810
She always pulls a long face.

632
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,880
Doesn't it upset you?

633
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,640
You mean Zhusi?

634
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,970
It upsets me.

635
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,400
So, I don't look at her.

636
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,090
Do you know why she does this?

637
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,250
Because she looks down on people.

638
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,330
I don't like it

639
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,360
when she remains domineering.

640
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,290
You're wrong, My Lady.

641
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,410
Think about it.

642
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,600
She's no longer young

643
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,390
and has lost her husband for years.

644
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,530
No man is around her.

645
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,570
Nobody could be happy in this condition.

646
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,330
I don't care.

647
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,760
My point is,

648
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,250
she needs to see a man.

649
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,620
(Jing Residence)

650
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,680
Ms. Luo,

651
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,920
you need feeding up.

652
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,600
Men like women with rosy cheeks.

653
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,150
Look at your face.

654
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,580
Sallow, indeed.

655
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,570
Who would like you?

656
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,840
What are you talking about?

657
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,400
I don't need feeding up.

658
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,570
You should eat more.

659
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,930
Besides,

660
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,810
my face isn't sallow.

661
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,410
Zhusi.

662
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,680
Youyou is right.

663
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,250
You really need

664
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,440
feeding up.

665
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,120
You should be more open-minded.

666
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,230
We're all single women.

667
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,260
Life can be comfortable.

668
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,390
But as time goes by,

669
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,770
you may feel uncomfortable.

670
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,810
What do you mean by that?

671
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,920
Have you thought about it?

672
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,920
You've been sad all the time.

673
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,300
If you have someone

674
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
to care for you,

675
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,400
won't you feel better?

676
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,050
Youyou, you have a point.

677
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,100
It makes sense.

678
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,050
It really does.

679
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,530
This is Chen.

680
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,330
I forgot to introduce him.

681
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,330
He's the owner of Huichun Opera House.

682
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,200
He also owns two private banks.

683
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,640
We've been friends for a dozen years.

684
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,340
I know him very well.

685
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,480
Why don't you get acquainted?

686
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,810
Oh, he's Mr. Chen.

687
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,290
He's obviously a nice guy.

688
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,130
Mr. Chen.

689
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,200
A very good young man.

690
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,400
Alright. Today is a good day.

691
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,250
You two should get acquainted.

692
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,000
Alright.

693
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,850
Chen,

694
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,330
let's get acquainted.

695
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,290
Where do you live?

696
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,920
How old are you?

697
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,570
Are you married?

698
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,260
- Youyou.
- Are your parents alive?

699
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,440
Do you have any children?

700
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,430
Youyou, this...

701
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,950
This should be a banquet.

702
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,920
Why do you make it a blind date?

703
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,200
(Blind date? You don't deserve it.)

704
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,780
You...

705
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,970
You can't have preconceptions.

706
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,530
Don't assume anything.

707
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,050
Get along with her.

708
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,780
If you hit it off, great.

709
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,470
If you don't, just be friends.

710
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,540
- Right?
- Fine.

711
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,740
Get along with her.

712
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,710
If you hit it off, great.

713
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,990
If you don't, just be friends.

714
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,990
It's no big deal.

715
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,330
Just get along with her.

716
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,500
How can I?

717
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,670
She's bad-tempered.

718
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,540
Her face is sallow.

719
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,430
And she isn't young.

720
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,300
I can't...

721
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,240
Who do you mean?

722
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,300
Her, right?

723
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,400
Old and sallow-faced.

724
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,500
Youyou,

725
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,440
you need feeding up.

726
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,430
Men like

727
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,810
rosy cheeks.

728
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,150
Mother, I'm full.

729
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,160
I'll take my leave.

730
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,670
You guys get along.

731
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,090
Keep having a nice time.

732
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,050
(I think you make a perfect match.)

733
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,970
How could she be so impolite?

734
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,570
Shut up now.

735
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,680
Come on.

736
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,500
Let's eat.

737
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,820
- Enjoy the food.
- Let's eat.

738
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,950
- Youyou, eat.
- Come on.

739
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,330
Get me some braised pork.

740
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,340
Madam, you invited Young Madam's mother

741
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,050
so early in the morning.

742
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,060
I've never seen you

743
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,640
have a friend in this family.

744
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,950
She isn't a friend.

745
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,920
Don't be ignorant.

746
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,470
She isn't?

747
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,490
But yesterday, I saw you
talk nicely to her.

748
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,040
Come on.

749
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,470
You've served me for years.

750
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,640
Why haven't you been smart yet?

751
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,780
Then why did you invite her over

752
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,720
in such a hurry?

753
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,740
Sixi's mother

754
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,340
appears to be straightforward.

755
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,600
But actually, she's shrewd.

756
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,990
She has realized

757
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,200
Sixi's mother-in-law

758
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,730
is a difficult woman.

759
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,910
So, she is

760
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,440
clearing obstacles for her daughter.

761
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,530
She's trying to marry Zhusi

762
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,810
to someone.

763
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,330
That's hilarious.

764
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,920
I thought she was just enthusiastic.

765
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,020
Don't bother to think.

766
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,400
You won't understand.

767
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,230
But Ai Sixi's mother

768
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,600
isn't smart enough.

769
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,330
I should remind her.

770
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:26,060
(Vibrant and Splendid)

771
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,060
It's a really nice chamber

772
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,400
for tea tasting.

773
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,890
Of course.

774
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,670
We're the supplier

775
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,200
of tribute tea, after all.

776
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,730
Take your seat.

777
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,890
Have some tea.

778
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,840
Mingxia, go get some snow water.

779
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,930
Yes.

780
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,770
Snow water?

781
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,200
What for?

782
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,530
For making tea.

783
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,500
Different kinds of water

784
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,160
are used for different types of tea.

785
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,970
You're even

786
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,440
so meticulous about tea.

787
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,580
Sixi is so lucky

788
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,970
to have married Jing Kan.

789
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,020
As the saying goes,

790
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,730
destiny brings people together.

791
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,500
We're destined

792
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,120
to be a family.

793
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,330
Think of Zhusi.

794
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,160
Sometimes, she's moody

795
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,490
and oversensitive.

796
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,530
But think of Sixi.

797
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,910
Sometimes, she behaves

798
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,160
without manners.

799
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,230
So, just as you can see,

800
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,170
she and Zhusi...

801
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,160
I'm quite worried.

802
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,390
I'm saying this

803
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,010
because I take you for a real friend.

804
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,090
I know.

805
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,190
So, Ms. Xue, I request you

806
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,640
to watch over Sixi.

807
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,870
If she behaves improperly,

808
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,720
criticize her.

809
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,780
I will.

810
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,630
She's like my own child.

811
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,570
Indeed.

812
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,850
Youyou.

813
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,970
You know what?

814
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,330
As for the blind date for Zhusi...

815
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,300
I totally support you.

816
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,530
We're on the same page.

817
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,260
Think about it.

818
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,470
A woman like her

819
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,050
needs a man.

820
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,870
When restrained,

821
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,530
she may behave better.

822
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,680
What do you think?

823
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,640
You're right.

824
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,720
Then tell me.

825
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,840
Who can be her man?

826
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,840
Don't be mad at what I'm going to say.

827
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,400
Last time,

828
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,530
Mr. Chen...

829
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,530
He's hopeless.

830
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,670
He can't attract Zhusi at all.

831
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,570
What kind of man fascinates her?

832
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,050
Someone like Kan's father.

833
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,640
Literate and talented.

834
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,090
Literate and talented?

835
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,480
That's not hard.

836
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,020
But if Ms. Luo

837
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,160
marries someone,

838
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,630
the burden of this family

839
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,640
will fall on you.

840
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,430
Won't that be too hard?

841
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,150
No, no. Not at all.

842
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,400
It won't be hard.

843
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,890
It's my responsibility.

844
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,060
By then, I'll ask Sixi

845
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,260
to share your burden.

846
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,430
She's like my own child, you know.

847
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,530
I won't rely on anyone but her.

848
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,300
I'm relieved

849
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,240
to hear that.

850
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,640
You may rest assured.

851
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,250
Have some tea.

852
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,440
Let me introduce him.

853
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,530
This is Master Yunzhu.

854
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,880
You don't need to.

855
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,400
Everyone here

856
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,090
knows him.

857
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,910
Please be seated,

858
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,850
Master Yunzhu.

859
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,330
Master Yunzhu,

860
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,680
please take that seat.

861
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,680
Close to Zhusi.

862
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,760
You can talk, then.

863
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,040
Where's Youyou?

864
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,250
Here I am.

865
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,760
Yunzhu,

866
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,330
how did you meet Youyou?

867
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,060
I used to sing Kun Opera

868
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,090
in a small town

869
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,530
and I wasn't very famous.

870
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,770
There was one time

871
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,600
when Youyou traveled to Songxi County

872
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,830
and heard me warm up

873
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,060
by the river.

874
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,720
She then recommended me to Mr. Yang

875
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,490
of Jiayun Opera House,
Anning Prefecture.

876
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,200
That's how I've come this far.

877
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,770
So,

878
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,200
Youyou not only helped me

879
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,600
but also improved me.

880
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,270
In this case,

881
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,530
you were discovered by Youyou.

882
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,450
You flatter me.

883
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,390
He was really competent

884
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,270
and talented.

885
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,370
He was hard-working, too.

886
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,060
Just like you,

887
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,680
I like operas.

888
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,990
He can sing really well.

889
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,160
So, I recommended him to my friend.

890
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,750
Let me introduce her.

891
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,090
This is Ms. Luo.

892
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,020
She's in charge of Jinyu Tea.

893
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,760
"Graceful businesswoman"

894
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,410
is a perfect word for her.

895
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,470
Why do you

896
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,490
keep nagging like that?

897
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,970
Master Yunzhu didn't ask at all.

898
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,660
I just want them

899
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,760
to communicate more.

900
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,620
Yunzhu, make yourself at home.

901
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,560
Help yourself.

902
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,200
Nice to meet you, My Lady.

903
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,890
Nice to meet you, madams.

904
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,310
My Lady

905
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,680
and Youyou,

906
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,850
thanks for inviting me over.

907
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,280
You're welcome.

908
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,870
Wow, he looks handsome

909
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,120
and he's so polite.

910
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,800
Don't you think so, Zhusi?

911
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,720
- Why?
- Muyun,

912
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,050
you have been babbling

913
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,280
all the time.

914
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
Master Yunzhu

915
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,410
is Mother's honored guest.

916
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,990
Save more time

917
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,910
for Mother

918
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,970
to talk with him.

919
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,430
Yunzhu,

920
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,310
will you sing a bit

921
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,280
to get us excited?

922
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,560
Great.

923
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,120
This is great!

924
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,640
Mother,

925
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,280
let him eat something first.

926
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,280
Perfect timing to sing before eating.

927
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,960
Terrific.
