00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,510
I won't run away.

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,670
See?

28
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,320
Who would cheat people

29
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,080
unless he had to?

30
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,280
You turn out to be a good son.

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,880
Why didn't you get a decent job?

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,000
You have no idea.

33
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,500
The treatment per day

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,600
costs one tael of silver.

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,680
And her treatment can't be slowed.

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,720
I had no choice but to...

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,920
Life is really hard for you.

38
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,600
It's my destiny.

39
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,340
Get in and say hello to her.

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,280
What?

41
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,880
I said, get in and say hello.

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,860
Or how can I believe

43
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,920
that's your mother?

44
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,440
How could you be so cold-blooded?

45
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,120
Illness tortures her every day.

46
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,200
Finally, she's asleep.
Don't disturb her.

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,620

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,640
Go ahead.

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,080
Mother,

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm such a bad son.

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,040
Sixi, let's go.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,440
Wake her up.

53
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,720
She's in a coma.

54
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,960
She won't wake up.

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,040
If she does,

56
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,640
it will be a miracle.

57
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,200
But you said she wanted some fish soup.

58
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,240
Yes, before she fell unconscious.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,060
Come on, Sixi. Let's not push him.

60
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,940
Let's get out of here.

61
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,880
No.

62
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,680
Who are you guys?

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh, Physician Zhou.

64
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,340
Hi, ma'am.

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,760
What is her problem?

66
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh, her.

67
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,760
Vessel blockage.

68
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,620
(Vessel blockage.
Blocked meridians & stagnant qi and blood)

69
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,560
Vessel blockage.

70
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,880
What is that?

71
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,000
She has that problem?

72
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,160
Yes.

73
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,280
My mother has that.

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,740
His mother has that.

75
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,040
Come on. Let's go.

76
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,720
Feels so good now.

77
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,840
What are you doing here?

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,120
This is your mother?

79
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,880
Mother, you're finally awake.

80
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,080
Who are you?

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,040
Let's talk after we go out.

82
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,360
Vessel blockage, huh?

83
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,880
How could you still laugh?

84
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,760
Mother, I miss you!

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,360
What's he doing again?

86
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,800
I don't know.

87
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,880
Fine.

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,960
That woman

89
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,160
isn't my mother.

90
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,680
So, who is your mother?

91
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,440
My mother...

92
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,200
She passed away.

93
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,480
You're such a liar.

94
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,440
She died on that sickbed.

95
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,660
Three.

96
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,600
When I was little,

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,520
I lived a life of privation.

98
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,380
Two.

99
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,480
Stop counting.

100
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,920
Wait, Sixi.

101
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,080
Will we really send him to jail?

102
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,400
He's Mr. An's disciple.

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,680
Then give back my money.

104
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,980
Hey.

105
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,840
We had wanted him to assist us.

106
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,560
How about this?

107
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,720
Let's do this.

108
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,900
He'll work for us to pay off his debt.

109
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,040
Are you insane?

110
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,040
He isn't a nice guy.

111
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,720
But I think he's cunning.

112
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,880
So?

113
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,400
So, businessmen are cunning.

114
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,680
I don't mean he can cheat people.

115
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,220
I just think Mr. An speaks highly of him

116
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,100
and we can try him.

117
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,840
If he fails, we can send him to jail.

118
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,100
What's the saying again?

119
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,400
Try, whatever the result is.

120
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,880
We'll use him.

121
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,560
Mother!

122
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,640
I miss you.

123
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,740
Do you know

124
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,220
what you will suffer

125
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,560
if we send you to yamen?

126
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,740
I'll be flogged and imprisoned.

127
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,760
If you don't want that,

128
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,240
we can give you a chance.

129
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,420
What is it?

130
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,580
Go to our tea shop

131
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,800
and sell tea for us.

132
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,740
I deceived you.

133
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,860
How could you still trust me?

134
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,180
We don't trust you,

135
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,320
but Mr. An.

136
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,540
So, he sent you.

137
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,480
Yes.

138
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,040
And you managed to cheat me.

139
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,340
It proves you have a knack.

140
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,320
It's easy to cheat you.

141
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,560
Jing Kan.

142
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,760
Is this all you can do?

143
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,460
Don't get cocky.

144
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,360
We're giving you a rightful offer.

145
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,400
Rightful offer?

146
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,080
To sell tea?

147
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,720
How?

148
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,880
One liang at a time?

149
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,980
Yeah.

150
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,100
It's just like how you walk.

151
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,400
One step at a time.

152
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,640
Let me tell you something.

153
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,280
I was learning from my master,

154
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,000
word by word.

155
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,760
But overnight,

156
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
I was swindled

157
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,120
out of all my money.

158
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,160
Now, when I think about it,

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm quite grateful to the swindler.

160
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,800
Thanks to him,

161
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,600
I avoided detours for dozens of years.

162
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,640
How were you taken in?

163
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,980
I was taken in

164
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,160
the way I fooled him.

165
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,580
But you...

166
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,520
Just listen.

167
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm not going.

168
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,460
(Taiping Government)

169
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,800
Have you made up my mind?

170
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,320
Stop trying to persuade me.

171
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,720
Forget it. Let him go.

172
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,380
You'll either go

173
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,840
the wrong or the right way.

174
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm quite familiar

175
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,640
with this place.

176
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,900
What are you doing here?

177
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,780
Where's your milord?

178
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,700
We request to see him.

179
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,640
Guys.

180
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
(Taiping Government)
Calm down.

181
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,540
What do you want?

182
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,020
Milord, have you caught

183
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,960
that swindler?

184
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,240
Not yet.

185
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,960
We've sent more constables.

186
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,280
You know, we're always short of men.

187
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,480
So, you can also look for him.

188
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,140
He even cheated people like us.

189
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,180
How inhumane!

190
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,020
Yeah.

191
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,940
The moment he shows up, we'll kill him!

192
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,000
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

193
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,580
You can kill him.

194
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,940
But don't do it here.

195
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,960
We're busy enough.

196
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,320
Kill him!

197
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm going to kill him!

198
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,160
- What's wrong??
- Kill him!

199
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,360
Nothing.

200
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,500
I just thought about your offer.

201
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,880
It sounds attractive.

202
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,720
So, they're looking for you.

203
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,780
Let's focus.

204
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,620
Where's your shop?

205
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,460
Let's go take a look.

206
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
Come on. Let's go.

207
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,460
This way, huh?

208
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,760
Kill him! We'll kill him!

209
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,820
(Jinyu Tea Plantation,
Anping Bridge Shop)

210
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,440
We've brought you back.

211
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,460
But it doesn't mean

212
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,040
we won't notify the government later.

213
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm not scared.

214
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,680
I want to make things right.

215
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,060
When it's being boiled,

216
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,040
bubbles will be like crabs' eyes.

217
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,480
You liar.

218
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,940
Sixi. I've got the addresses

219
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,100
of those fruit vendors.

220
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,040
Good.

221
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,120
Why?

222
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,040
This is the offer you're giving me?

223
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,960
Here. The IOU.

224
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,440
Sign it and add your fingerprints.

225
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,440
And...

226
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,880
Your salary is one tael.

227
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,160
That's a lot.

228
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,940
You're quite generous.

229
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,960
That's not very low pay.

230
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,180
Ninety percent of the money

231
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,380
will be used to pay us

232
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,880
and the fruit vendors we saw.

233
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,220
How could you do this?

234
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,340
For Mr. An's sake,

235
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,440
we offer board and lodging.

236
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,060
Can't I live at my own place?

237
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,560
We no longer trust you.

238
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,740
In this case,

239
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,590
just let me go.

240
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,600
Guiwei, go get the vendors.

241
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,480
Hey, don't.

242
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,900
Anyway,

243
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,180
we can grow to trust each other.

244
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,320
Let's try harder and harder.

245
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,000
Good. Very good.

246
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,880
Let me introduce you guys.

247
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,340
The man behind you

248
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,660
is Guiwei, the manager

249
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,800
of Anping Bridge Shop.

250
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,820
And this one

251
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,440
will be our shop assistant.

252
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,160
I'll take good care of you.

253
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,160
Tu Master.

254
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,540
Guiwei,

255
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,940
he'll be your responsibility.

256
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,640
Keep a very close eye on him.

257
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,620
If he escapes,

258
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,660
break one of his legs

259
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,580
and ask the vendors
to break his other leg.

260
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,520
Then he'll be in jail.

261
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,540
Yes.

262
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,600
Hey, this is ridiculous.

263
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,080
Jing Kan.

264
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,120
Can't we negotiate?

265
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,800
There's no wiggle room?

266
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,880
Hey, man.

267
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,380
Aren't you way too close?

268
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,320
Not at all.

269
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,800
Please don't.

270
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, guys. I...

271
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,340
I'm sorry, all right?

272
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,840
Don't leave me here alone.

273
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,020
Look at this guy.

274
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,200
He's insane, isn't he?

275
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,920
He looks a bit abnormal.

276
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,120
Be quiet when you eat.

277
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,400
How's Ruan Ling doing lately?

278
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,480
Not bad.

279
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,960
Since he came,

280
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,160
our shop has been much cleaner.

281
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
That's good.

282
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,320
It means he's hard-working.

283
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,540
He isn't.

284
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,520
He's rather fussy.

285
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,040
Fussy?

286
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
He takes three or four baths a day.

287
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,900
Then does he have time for work?

288
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,460
Yeah. He's busy fetching water.

289
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,600
I do all the work.

290
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,440
Oh, Ruan Ling.

291
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,900
What if he escapes

292
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,840
when you have breakfast?

293
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,040
He won't. Don't worry, Kan.

294
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,900
Why?

295
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,320
I've been observing for days.

296
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,680
Now, he's in the situation

297
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,400
where everybody spits at him.

298
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,800
Even if you let him out,

299
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,360
he'll avoid his enemies.

300
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,300
That's good, then.

301
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,500
It's not bad to be a neat guy.

302
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,200
We sell some kind of drink, after all.

303
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,080
The cleanness in his body

304
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,240
can't cover up the flaws

305
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,680
in his virtue.

306
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,980
Good point, Guiwei.

307
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,520
You sound more cultured.

308
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,920
The egg is too salty.

309
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,680
That's my cup.

310
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,380
Fine, it's your cup.

311
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,560
So what? I'm healthy.

312
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,980
Let me wipe it, then.

313
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,520
I didn't mean to blame you.

314
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,760
How could you blame me?

315
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,000
I...

316
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,800
Jiao'e.

317
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,920
Don't call me that.

318
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,320
I'm a lady.

319
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,400
A respected lady.

320
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,600
Don't be so impolite.

321
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,880
I...

322
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,240
I'm here to tell you something.

323
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,300
The Old Lady dug out

324
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,380
some fancy vests,

325
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,560
and pearl headbands.

326
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,320
You deliver them to Great-grandaunt.

327
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,160
Great-grandaunt. Who's that?

328
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,920
Great-grandaunt.

329
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,800
The Old Lady's aunt, of course.

330
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,180
Do you even need to ask?

331
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,820
- Why don't you go?
- I'm busy.

332
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,700
With what?

333
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,640
I...

334
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,180
I don't need

335
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,720
to tell you what I'm busy with.

336
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,160
Ridiculous.

337
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,200
Jiao'e.

338
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,400
Join us for breakfast.

339
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,160
What a flatterer.

340
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,900
So, you have

341
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,020
a great-grandaunt?

342
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,040
She must be very old.

343
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,260
She isn't, actually.

344
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,200
Just the seniority.

345
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,600
Then where is she?

346
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,180
I heard she married

347
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,840
a silk shop owner in the west of town.

348
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,040
Haven't seen her for ages.

349
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,020
She and Luo Zhusi

350
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,240
don't get along at all.

351
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,640
She even fought Cuiying once.

352
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,280
That's really a brave woman.

353
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,520
I must meet her.

354
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,360
Madam,

355
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,980
why did you take out

356
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,920
this agate bracelet again?

357
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,160
This is the first present

358
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,200
Beishui gave me.

359
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,560
I remember that.

360
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,860
Back then, you gave him a jade ring

361
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,880
in return.

362
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,240
The Old Lady said

363
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,540
the two of you loved each other

364
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,720
and she was relieved
when you got married.

365
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,600
Tell me.

366
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,280
If we could live again,

367
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,660
would Beishui still marry me?

368
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,580
Of course.

369
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,700
You and Master

370
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,660
were a perfect match.

371
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,660
I'm afraid

372
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,060
he cared more about Qin Baoyi.

373
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,180
Qin Baoyi is nothing.

374
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,660
Red agate symbolizes eternity.

375
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,260
If he hadn't cared about you,

376
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,180
why would he give you this?

377
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,620
Eternity.

378
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,500
Now,

379
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm alone for all eternity.

380
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,260
Don't assume anything.

381
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,420
Today is your birthday.

382
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,380
Look.

383
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,140
These are presents

384
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,420
from our staff in Jinyu Tea.

385
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,380
And this is from Mr. Wang.

386
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,300
It looks superior, obviously.

387
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,100
So many people have sent presents.

388
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,820
But people in this family

389
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,900
act as if they didn't remember at all.

390
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,980
You should be used to that.

391
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,660
In their eyes,

392
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,380
Qin Baoyi is more important.

393
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,820
Who cares?

394
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,100
Master loved you.

395
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,620
And that matters most.

396
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
Tell me.

397
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,940
Did Beishui and I

398
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,780
fail to have a child

399
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,940
because of Aji?

400
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
That's impossible.

401
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,500
Don't be silly.

402
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,380
According to Physician Zhou,

403
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,620
you didn't have a child

404
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,620
because of mental exhaustion.

405
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,940
Did Aji write to me?

406
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,660
I think so.

407
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,420
The letter is being delivered, I guess.

408
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,060
He only remembers his mother's birthday.

409
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,620
How would he remember

410
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,540
his auntie's birthday?

411
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,500
Madam.

412
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,660
What's up?

413
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,900
The Old Lady invited Madam to lunch.

414
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,580
A lot of dishes are served.

415
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,900
(Yushi Chamber)

416
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,140
There you are.

417
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,300
Look, Madam.

418
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,740
Isn't that the jade bracelet

419
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
you gave her?

420
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,980
I saw it.

421
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,140
Mother.

422
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,340
Greetings, Mother.

423
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,700
Take your seat.

424
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,180
Be seated, please.

425
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,660
Today is a big day.

426
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,460
We should celebrate it.

427
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,380
That's right.

428
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,460
Go to Fu's Restaurant

429
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,660
and buy two jars of Furong Wine

430
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,620
that Mother loves.

431
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,420
Yes. I'm on it.

432
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,700
It's so thoughtful of you.

433
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,060
It's thoughtful of you, Mother.

434
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,900
You don't need to do this.

435
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,060
I do.

436
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,660
Today is the day

437
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,500
when Beishui called me Mother
for the first time.

438
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,740
Old Lady,

439
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,220
what did you just say?

440
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,060
The day when Beishui

441
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,460
called me Mother for the first time.

442
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,060
At this time 53 years ago,

443
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,100
Beishui was only five months old.

444
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,220
It was blowing hard that night.

445
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,620
My husband got out of bed
to close the window.

446
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,260
Beishui sat on the bed,

447
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,500
looked at me,

448
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,300
and called me Mother.

449
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,780
He was so smart,

450
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,460
so thoughtful,

451
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,300
and so short-lived.

452
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,500
He died at a young age

453
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,620
and that wasn't my fault.

454
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,020
Old Lady,

455
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,260
do you only care

456
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,180
for your son

457
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,700
instead of his wife?

458
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,580
Watch your tone.

459
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,420
How rude.

460
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,460
What are you talking about?

461
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
Today is Madam's birthday.

462
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,180
So many dishes are served.

463
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,740
I thought you'd celebrate her birthday.

464
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,380
Your birthday?

465
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,940
Before, you always remembered

466
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,460
to celebrate Concubine Qin's birthday.

467
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,380
You...

468
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,700
- Why?
- Not another word.

469
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,060
Why did I never forget Concubine Qin?

470
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,260
Because she was devoted

471
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,820
to the tea business.

472
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
What about you guys?

473
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
I know very well

474
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,980
what you're up to.

475
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,980
Look.

476
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,940
Concubine Qin

477
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,820
bought this for me

478
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,220
at my 70th birthday.

479
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,220
She cared for me.

480
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,700
Have you ever cared for me?

481
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,860
She bought it for you?

482
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,060
But...

483
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
I actually bought it.

484
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,020
Even if you don't remember

485
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,980
how much I care for you,

486
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,540
you shouldn't

487
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,140
thank someone else

488
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,660
for what I've done for you.

489
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,180
I need respect, too.

490
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,660
You need nothing.

491
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,980
You need respect?

492
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,980
Do the two of you respect me?

493
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,900
You yelled at me.

494
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,100
I know

495
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,460
you never like me.

496
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,220
Back then,

497
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,540
when I married Beishui,

498
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,460
everyone else

499
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,060
looked happy.

500
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,980
But you didn't like me.

501
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,980
You even said my cheekbones were high

502
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,060
and I looked ruthless.

503
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,860
I...

504
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,420
Do I have high cheekbones?

505
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,020
Nonsense.

506
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,220
Was I wrong?

507
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,780
Your face shapes your heart.

508
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,380
Look at you.

509
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
You're exactly

510
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,700
revengeful and narrow-minded.

511
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,980
What's wrong with the Old Lady?

512
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,740
I think she's against Ms. Luo.

513
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,300
Of course, she is.

514
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,540
It's Ms. Luo's birthday.

515
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,740
Since this morning,

516
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,500
dozens of guys came for it,

517
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,140
but none of them greeted the Old Lady.

518
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,180
They showed no respect at all.

519
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,060
- I see.
- I'll tell Grandmother

520
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,980
what she did to me.

521
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,300
Calm down.

522
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,460
What did Ms. Luo do again?

523
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,740
This morning,

524
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,020
I treated Tea Guild members
at Fu's Restaurant.

525
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,980
When I was going to pay,

526
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,620
the waiter didn't put it on the account.

527
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,860
He said,

528
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,620
"Chief Luo ordered us.

529
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,580
Anyone from the Jing clan

530
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,540
should put the bill on his own account."

531
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,820
- That's reasonable.
- Not at all!

532
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,700
If she wanted this,

533
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,740
she should have told me.

534
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,460
- She fooled me!
- Keep your voice down.

535
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,580
I was so embarrassed then!

536
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,500
Come on, calm down.

537
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,860
Calm down, please.

538
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,060
Dear, it's nothing.

539
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,460
It's just nothing, right?

540
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,420
Since when can an outsider

541
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,380
take charge of this family?

542
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,780
- Keep your voice down.
- Why?

543
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,780
Grandma is still alive!

544
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,420
She isn't a Ms. Jing, either.

545
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,260
Fine. You're sophisticated.

546
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,380
You've been around.

547
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,300
You're impressive.

548
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,500
Of course.

549
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,100
I'm far more experienced

550
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,500
than you.

551
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,180
Yes. You've seen far more things

552
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,460
than I have.

553
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,660
Sounds like they're fighting.

554
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,820
Rather fiercely.

555
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,420
You know what?

556
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,940
Very well.

557
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,940
Luo Zhusi, since you

558
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,580
turn your back on me,

559
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,980
I will

560
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,740
make your trouble worse.

561
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
Dear, what are you going to do again?

562
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,780
(Tong Residence)

563
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,700
Is it here?

564
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,540
Yes, as I remember.

565
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,380
What shall we do?

566
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,180
Knock or...

567
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,380
Someone's out.

568
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,180
Who do you want to see?

569
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,980
Excuse me. We're from the Jing clan.

570
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,580
We were sent to deliver something

571
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,500
to my great-grandaunt.

572
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,700
The Jing clan?

573
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Good. I have something

574
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,420
to tell you.

575
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,900
Your great-grandaunt

576
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,300
has been divorced.

577
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,660
Divorced?

578
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,900
A daughter-in-law like her

579
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,020
showed no respect,

580
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,340
slacked off for food,

581
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,780
kept drinking too much wine,

582
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,940
and talked rudely.

583
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,500
Anyone who has this kind of lazy wife

584
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,700
will be cursed

585
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,220
for millions of years.

586
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,500
Ma'am,

587
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,100
watch your mouth.

588
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,380
Don't bother to comment.

589
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,500
Then where is

590
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,660
our great-grandaunt?

591
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,580
We sent her to Yuanyang House.

592
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,180
(Tong Residence)

593
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,540
Yuanyang House.

594
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,460
Will we really break into Yuanyang House

595
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,780
to save Great-grandaunt?

596
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,980
Or what?

597
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,300
Her ex-husband
didn't give a guarantee letter.

598
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,160
We can't let her stay

599
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,260
and be tortured to death.

600
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,540
Shall we tell Grandmother about it?

601
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,860
I told her this afternoon.

602
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,100
She quarreled with Luo Zhusi

603
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,020
and fainted from anger.

604
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,740
She's fine.

605
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,580
Physician Zhou said

606
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,500
she was just agitated.

607
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,420
Medicine will help.

608
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,300
Luo Zhusi.

609
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,940
Will you or will you not go with me?

610
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,980
Are you actually scared?

611
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm not.

612
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,660
I've been planning this.

613
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,700
No one could take me there.

614
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,020
Then get changed.

615
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,020
Go ahead.

616
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,100
You sit down here

617
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,020
and I'll do it there.

618
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:03,980
Don't peek.

619
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,900
I won't.

620
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,700
What are you doing?

621
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,980
What are you waiting for?

622
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,420
Don't be shy and get changed.

623
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,540
Turn around.

624
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,700
Alright.

625
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
I'll turn around.

626
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,620
Don't act like an outsider.

627
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,140
It breaks my heart.

628
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,380
I've seen everything.

629
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,340
Do it quick.

630
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,220
What are we doing here?

631
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Don't say anything.

632
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,780
Get in there.

633
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,900
I'll cover you.

634
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,140
Don't laugh.

635
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,260
I didn't laugh.

636
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,380
Stop pretending.

637
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,620
You look pretty.

638
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,340
Don't say that.

639
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,860
Handsome, I mean.

640
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Why must I wear this?

641
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,900
Men aren't allowed in here.

642
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,460
Stop it, or I'll leave.

643
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,420
I'll leave now.

644
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,580
Come on. I was wrong.

645
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,140
I really was.

646
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,580
I won't laugh anymore.

647
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,500
I swear.

648
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,260
It's dangerous.

649
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,060
"Wei Junyi is so cunning.

650
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,140
She's old

651
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,260
and lame.

652
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,940
How could a muddle-headed woman

653
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,940
take charge of this family?

654
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,860
Breathing is

655
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,260
all she can expect.

656
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,820
In a few years,

657
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,180
she might even pass away."

658
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,220
She...

659
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,180
Did she really say that?

660
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,420
She said something even worse.

661
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,580
I...

662
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,740
I'm too embarrassed to repeat it.

663
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,980
She thinks I'm old and lame.

664
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,260
So, she doesn't respect me at all.

665
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,460
You're right.

666
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,380
Grandmother, I defended you.

667
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,180
But just when I started,

668
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,220
her face reddened

669
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,700
with rage.

670
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,860
Grandmother, you must protect me.

671
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,820
Go tell her.

672
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,670
If she still wants

673
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,660
a peaceful life in this family,

674
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,860
she must hide

675
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,780
all her schemes!

676
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,340
Expect me to pass away?

677
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,380
I'll even live longer than her!

678
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,340
Go.

679
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,500
Go tell her

680
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,260
what I just said, word for word.

681
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,020
That's all?

682
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180
Are you afraid?

683
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,260
No, of course.

684
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,540
I'm going now.

685
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,500
Grandmother, calm down.

686
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,260
Calm down. I'm on it.

687
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,180
Old Lady.

688
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,630
- Calm down.
- Oh no.

689
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,020
This isn't scolding.

690
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,820
Calm down. Health matters most.

691
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,660
Pat on my back.

692
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,900
Alright.

693
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,260
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

694
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,860
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

695
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,780
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

696
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,180
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

697
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,860
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

698
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,100
I won't fight back when...

699
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,020
Stop!

700
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,980
From you on...

701
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,060
Keep walking forward.

702
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,980
And you.

703
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,380
Wait.

704
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,140
Why are you wearing men's boots?

705
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,380
Why do you have an Adam's Apple?

706
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,060
I'm a woman.

707
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,380
You think I'm blind?

708
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,780
Come on.

709
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,660
How did you do that?

710
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,580
I'll teach you later.

711
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,780
Today, I did a poor job.

712
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,700
I was defenseless

713
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,180
and I never practiced.

714
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,100
So, she caught me off guard.

715
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,300
When she said "nothing",

716
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,780
you should have called her old rascal.

717
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,420
Right. I should have said that.

718
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,380
She's terrible.

719
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,340
She's the old...

720
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,220
No.

721
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,780
I shouldn't call her that.

722
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,860
You can.

723
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,540
You should have cursed her like that.

724
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,420
Don't say that.

725
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,500
Don't be silly.

726
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,420
Maids were around us.

727
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,540
If it got out,

728
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,940
it would be indecent.

729
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,780
Think about it.

730
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,340
She's my mother-in-law.

731
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,620
I shouldn't be rude to her.

732
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,420
Go prepare some Furong Wine.

733
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,710
Yes.

734
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,420
Ms. Luo,

735
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,660
here's a message from Grandmother.

736
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,420
What message?

737
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,420
What else did she say?

738
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,420
Grandmother also said,

739
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,340
"Luo Zhusi is a terrible woman.

740
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,180
No wonder nobody likes her.

741
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,420
She turns out to be

742
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,180
very ungrateful.

743
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,500
I wish she would fall

744
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,300
and get choked by food or water.

745
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
Unless she

746
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,660
treats Zhenzhu better,

747
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,180
I'll go sweep her tomb

748
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,220
during the coming Qingming Festival."

749
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,980
I think you're stirring up trouble.

750
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,460
Not at all.

751
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,580
I'm just a messenger.

752
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,540
If you don't believe,

753
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,820
go ask Grandmother.

754
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,380
She said something else.

755
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,660
She said, "Zhusi

756
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,700
wasn't as good as Concubine Qin."

757
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,100
Madam,

758
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,340
it's your new birthday present.

759
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,620
What is wrong with the Old Lady?

760
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,380
I used to respect my mother-in-law.

761
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,900
But now,

762
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,820
I don't need to do that.

763
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,900
Auntie, now you know.

764
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,140
In Grandmother's heart,

765
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,020
you've always been

766
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,740
an outsider of this family.

767
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,140
But Concubine Qin is different.

768
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,260
She's virtuous, gentle, and amiable.

769
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,300
You have no idea.

770
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,140
Do you know

771
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,020
what she did?

772
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,060
Don't argue with her.

773
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,900
Cuiying,

774
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,660
sort out all the things

775
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,580
Mother gave me

776
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,260
including the hairpins and jewels.

777
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,860
Return them to her.

778
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,100
Go tell Mother.

779
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,580
I won't take her as Mother anymore.

780
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,420
Ask her to ignore me, too.

781
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,180
From this day on,

782
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,820
we're totally finished.

783
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,780
Go check over there.

784
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,300
Busy, huh?

785
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,740
Governesses.

786
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,700
Yeah. A few lashes to go.

787
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,340
Alright.

788
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,580
You may continue.

789
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,500
Alright.

790
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,780
Something's not right.

791
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,540
Help!

792
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,140
- Somebody!
- Don't run.

793
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,380
Help! Thief!

794
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,580
Somebody help! Thief!

795
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,500
Help! Somebody help!

796
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,200
Later,

797
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,370
you go get Great-grandaunt

798
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,580
and I'll lure away the others.

799
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,420
Then we'll meet

800
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,340
where we climbed over.

801
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,420
Did you get it?

802
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Understand?

803
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,140
Yes.

804
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,380
I'll go alone?

805
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
Or what?

806
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,220
Make the bed thicker later.

807
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,860
Move.

808
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,820
Is the hot water ready?

809
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,500
Please drink it.

810
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,420
Chief will be sleeping here.

811
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,340
Go away.

812
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,780
Drink it, please.

813
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,300
Great-grandaunt.

814
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,420
Great-grandaunt.

815
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,220
Great-grandaunt.

816
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,540
Great-grandaunt.

817
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,180
Oh, Great-grandaunt.

818
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,820
It's you, Kan.

819
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,660
Why are you dressed like this?

820
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,780
Were you also sent in here forcibly?

821
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,460
My wife and I came to save you.

822
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,540
Go with me.

823
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,380
Somebody come!

824
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,540
What took Jing Kan so long?

825
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,500
Sixi.

826
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,420
Don't say my name.

827
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,300
What...

828
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,540
It feels so good

829
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,580
to be trusted.

830
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,380
This is your great-grandaunt?

831
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,540
Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming.

832
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,060
Let me introduce you. This is my...

833
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,300
It's not good timing.

834
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,620
Let's get out of here first.

835
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,940
That's right. Come on.

836
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,380
That's right.

837
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,980
Listen.

838
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,940
You get down, and I'll go up on you.

839
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,860
Alright.

840
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,900
Let me do it.

841
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,170
- No. I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

842
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,010
I will do this.

843
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,380
I said, I'll do it.

844
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,260
Either of you will do.

845
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,900
You go ahead, then.

846
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,620
- I'll tread on you.
- Wait.

847
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,460
Tie up your dress.

848
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,320
That's right.

849
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,620
- Here I go.
- Alright.

850
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,100
Come on. Three, two, one.

851
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,340
Go.

852
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,140
Are you holding it?

853
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,020
Yes.

854
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,100
Tight?

855
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,500
Yes.

856
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,940
Alright. I'll go.

857
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,460
Why is it you?

858
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,500
- It's me.
- Jing Kan.

859
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,540
This is your wife?

860
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,260
Great-grandaunt.

861
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,140
Governesses, come!

862
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,500
Someone's running away!

863
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,220
- Come! Someone's escaping!
- Sixi, you...

864
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,380
Oh, no. I can't hold it.

865
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,340
Governesses, come!

866
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,060
Governesses! Governesses!

867
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,140
Someone's running away!

868
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,540
Governesses, wake up!

869
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,660
Someone's running away!

870
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,260
Go get her back.

871
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,220
Jing Kan, let's go.

872
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,100
But...

873
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,020
She's still up there.

874
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,740
No. 357.

875
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,740
Someone's escaping.

876
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,180
Get down here.

877
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,100
Come down.

878
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,020
Get down here.

879
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,420
No. 357,

880
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,180
I'll always hate you.

881
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,340
Get down here.

882
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,060
Come down.

883
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Hey, let me go.

884
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,300
What was happening?

885
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,020
Your family totally sucks.

886
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,940
What do you mean?

887
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,160
Do you remember I told you

888
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,020
when I was there,

889
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,140
someone framed and told on me.

890
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,400
Yes.

891
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,740
Guess who that evil woman is.

892
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,620
My great-grandaunt?

893
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,940
Exactly.

894
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,260
But now she's caught.

895
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,460
Will she be tortured more?

896
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,980
Tortured?

897
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,260
Why don't you think

898
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,220
about how I was tortured

899
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,380
when she framed me?

900
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,380
Right.

901
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,500
Who framed you

902
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,820
deserves to be tortured.

903
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,300
She must scream,

904
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,020
suffer,

905
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,940
and repent.

906
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,660
But anyway, she was nice to me.

907
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,700
She even defended me.

908
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,340
None of my business.

909
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,860
She was divorced

910
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,060
and has nowhere to go.

911
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,940
If we leave her alone,

912
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,580
she... she'll be doomed.

913
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,340
Gentlewoman.

914
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,420
Great woman.

915
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,940
Super awesome woman.

916
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,340
Gorgeous woman.

917
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,980
Don't try that!

918
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,340
Super...

919
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,500
I'll stop.

920
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,660
Oh, governess.

921
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,500
Ran away, huh?

922
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,220
Ran away.

923
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,740
Governess, I was wrong.

924
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,340
Ran away, huh?

925
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,500
Ran away.

926
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,020
I was wrong. I really was.

927
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,740
I just won't.

928
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,380
You're a cunning woman.

929
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,740
You pretended to be obedient.

930
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,500
So, you were trying to run away.

931
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,460
Governess, wait!

932
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,500
Wait, governess.

933
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,180
Let me explain all this.

934
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,300
Go ahead.

935
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,540
Think about it.

936
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,020
After I make one more contribution,

937
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,460
- I can go out, right?
- Yes.

938
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,620
Then why did I escape?

939
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,460
Yeah. Why...?

940
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,260
- Someone tricked me.
- Who?

941
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,420
The woman who looks

942
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,980
like a stone lion, No. 357.

943
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,820
No. 357?

944
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,710
Yes.

945
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,620
How dare you shift the blame!

946
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,460
I'm not shifting the blame.

947
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,780
She really came back

948
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,300
and egged me on to escape.

949
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,620
She egged you on?

950
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,100
Yes.

951
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,340
No one

952
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,340
dares to come back here.

953

I'm telling the truth.

954
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,860
Really?

955
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,420
Yes.

956
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,100
When she asked you to run,

957
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,060
you ran away, huh?

958
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,260
You failed to reject her

959
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,340
and that was still your problem!

960
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:52,940
No. 357.

961
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,380
Flog!
