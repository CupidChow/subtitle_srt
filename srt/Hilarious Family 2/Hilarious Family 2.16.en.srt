25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,180
I was wondering

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,860
why you had been

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,180
so flamboyant,

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,900
just like a blossoming peacock.

29
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,060
Yunzhu is still young.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,420
What about you?

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,820
How could you flirt with him?

32
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,580
You've totally disgraced

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,820
our family.

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,500
I...I...

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,380
I didn't know what happened to me.

36
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,100
I just...

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,100
All of a sudden,

38
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,260
I got that urge

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,940
as if I were possessed.

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,060
Oh, I see.

41
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,940
During Yunzhu's first visit,

42
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,540
Muyun nagged all the time.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,420
So, she wanted to marry him.

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,980
But the other day, you came to my room,

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,540
saying you would get Zhusi

46
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,740
a good husband.

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,420
How come you want this man instead?

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,140
You care so much about me

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
and I'm really grateful.

50
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,980
It's not my idea to match-make

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,260
Zhusi and Yunzhu.

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,540
Whose idea is that?

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,980
It's...

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,140
Confess.

55
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,260
Sixi's mother egged me on.

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,820
I...I was misguided.

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,660
Go.

58
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,740
Get Sixi's mother here.

59
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,660
Yes.

60
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,980
Ms. Mai.

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,140

68
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,020
She isn't in there.

69
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,380
Where has she gone?

70
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,860
I don't know.

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,220
She just left a letter.

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,980
guessed it right.

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,660
My mother kept her pan-firing method

76
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,580
in that poem.

77
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,980
Mother is really impressive.

78
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,420
One clue leads to another.

79
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,100
We need smart brains.

80
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,380
I'll be able to remake Banfang Tea.

81
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,260
Thanks to you, Sixi.

82
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,140

83
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,020

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,020

85
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,340

86
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,660

88
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,060
Stay away. I'll poke him.

93
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,740

anything unusual?

99
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,380
No.

100
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,820
I smelled a fragrance

101
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,060
and then I fell unconscious.

102
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,260
Kan,

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,230
don't you think it's unlucky

104
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,090
to sleep alone?

105
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,380
He had a bed, and it happened.

106

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,140
Guiwei,

108
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,500
you recited like,

109
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,740
"The first bowl dries the throat.

115
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,180
The third..

116
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
The third bowl will stop you?

117
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,060
What is that?

118
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,860
Kan, I've been reading a novel.

119
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,620
Then, I remember it wrong.

120
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,300
It's all right. I'll think about it.

121
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,140
Guiwei, this is very important.

122
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,240
We think this poem has

123
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,500
the pan-firing of Banfang Tea.

124
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,420
Oh,

125
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,060
Sixi and I will go out.

126
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,220
Aren't you going to find out

127
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,380
who burned the painting?

128

We are, of course.

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,820
I think this guy

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,500
is just around me.

132
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,300
I can't investigate

133
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
in a flagrant way.

134
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,140
Or they would be defensive.

135
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,340
Defensive.

136
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,060
Let's also be defensive.

137
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,420
Are you saying

138
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,420
we'll do one thing
under the cover of another?

139
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,220
You'll take care of the shop.

140
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,740
Oh, Guiwei.

141
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,940
You'll move to Jing Residence.

142
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,620
Check if anyone acts suspiciously.

143
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,900
Alright.

144
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,140
Anyway, Guiwei

145
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,340
recall the poem as soon as possible.

146
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,180
Alright, Kan.

147
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,140
Count on me.

148
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,100
The first bowl dries the throat.

149
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,020
The second bowl kills loneliness.

150
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,620
This world is filled

151
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,500
with scenes and plots.

152
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,860
The closer you get to success,

153
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,620
the closer they'll get to you.

154
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,140
Thank you

155
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
for comforting us.

156
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,300
I thought you would satirize us.

157
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,980
I was about to satirize you

158
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,180
after comforting you.

159
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,500
Considering your current state,

160
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,300
even if the painting hadn't been burned,

161
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,540
you might not manage

162
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,860
to remake Banfang Tea.

163
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
I have a junior brother

164
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,020
who has recently traveled here.

165
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
In the early years,

166
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,340
he was famous all over the world

167
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,580
for Songluo Tea,

168
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,980
known as a pan-firing master.

169
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,420
Are you talking about Tea-gold?

170
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,380
You know him?

171
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,220
What's so great about him?

172
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,580
The tea he pan-fires

173
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,900
is as precious as gold.

174
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
So, people call him Tea-gold.

175
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,300
Mr. An,

176
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,580
I can't believe

177
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,500
Master Tea-gold is your junior brother.

178
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,340
You never talked about him before.

179
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,780
During our apprenticeship days,

180
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,140
he was active while I was quiet.

181
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,380
I didn't know

182
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,620
he would be a monk.

183
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,540
But I assisted your grandfather

184
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,860
in building Jinyu Tea.

185
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,660
You're really generous

186
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,080
to introduce him to us.

187
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,060
I'm not.

188
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,460
Getting to know him won't help.

189
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,620
Only his guidance in skills

190
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,140
will be beneficial

191
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,980
to develop fancy tea

192
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,740
and even remake Banfang Tea.

193
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,860
Mr. An,

194
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,740
can we get guidance

195
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,140
from Master Tea-gold?

196
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,220
There's a chance.

197
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,180
But you can't go

198
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,340
just like this.

199
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,140
Shall we prepare

200
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,060
some gifts?

201
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,780
It's not about gifts.

202
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,380
People drink tea.

203
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,220
All in all,

204
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,620
tea leaves matter most.

205
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,300
Jing's Tea Plantation

206
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,260
has many tea trees, huh?

207
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,740
Jing's Tea Plantation

208
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,140
has long failed.

209
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,380
In the past years,

210
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,660
to get early tea leaves,

211
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,580
the Jing Clan

212
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,620
has always been the first
to pick tea buds.

213
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,340
When the vitality is stifled,

214
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,980
tea leaves certainly
lost their spiritual energy.

215
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,060
To prevent

216
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,620
other plants from getting nutrients,

217
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,020
all the other plants

218
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,380
have been uprooted.

219
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,580
From afar,

220
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,540
only tea leaves
and brown earth can be seen,

221
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,460
layer by layer.

222
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,100
In this environment,
tea leaves have lost

223
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
their charm.

224
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,020
Without charm,

225
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,620
spirit, or wildness,

226
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,700
how can a tea tree produce

227
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,460
the best tea leaves?

228
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,460
Mr. An,

229
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,300
what you said

230
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,380
totally enlightened me.

231
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,340
Then, where can we find

232
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,580
a tea tree

233
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,980
which is still wild?

234
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,340
Grandfather.

235
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,980
I'll help you more, then.

236
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,020
My grandchild, An Wanqing.

237
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,500
She's familiar with nearby tea hills.

238
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,020
(An Wanqing, Mr. An's grandchild)
She'll take you

239
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,340
to Beiyuan Mountain.

240
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,580
Be careful.

241
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,820
Hurry up.

242
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,340
I can't walk anymore.

243
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,860
- I just can't.
- Neither can I.

244
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,820
I need a break.

245
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,260
How could you be so slow?

246
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,140
How could you be so fast?

247
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,180
- Climbing slowly is more tiring.
- Is it?

248
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,340
Let's move on.

249
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,300
Leeches are here.

250
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,220
Leeches?

251
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,580
Where are they?

252
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,260
Why are you so scared of them?

253
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,740
One bit me when I was little.

254
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,700
Here, right?

255
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,820
How do you know?

256
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,100
You cried to your mother.

257
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,380
- You...
- I was beside you.

258
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,940
You're the braided girl who laughed.

259
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,500
Now you remember me, Crybaby.

260
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,980
I didn't expect you to be prettier

261
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,260
after all these years.

262
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,980
But you're not my type.

263
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,020
Don't be silly, childhood sweetheart.

264
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,140
Sixi, look.

265
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,080
That mountain is high.

266
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,940
We must hurry up.

267
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,060
When it gets dark,

268
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,900
it'll be dangerous.

269
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,820
I'll explore the way.

270
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,620
So, you're childhood sweethearts.

271
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,100
Grandfather told me,

272
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,380
or I wouldn't recognize him.

273
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,220
He's uglier now.

274
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
He used to be adorable.

275
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,060
Really?

276
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,260
But I think he's handsome.

277
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,500
Love makes you blind.

278
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,420
Stop chatting. Catch up.

279
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,620
The scenery here is good.

280
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,540
Let's go.

281
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,420
Leeches are here.

282
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,340
Let's go.

283
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:44,780
(Balmy and Soothing)

284
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,180
Someone's coming.

285
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
That guy is tall.

286
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,580
It's not him.

287
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,180
It's not her.

288
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,460
It's not her.

289
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,980
What are you doing here?

290
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Chatting?

291
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,940
- She...
- Send it now.

292
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,980
She's gorgeous.

293
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,060
What are you doing?

294
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,220
Don't get distracted.

295
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,740
(Rising Sun)

296
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,180
Great martial arts.

297
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,940
Not him.

298
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,340
Not her.

299
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,580
Who did this?

300
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,140
Who misplaced the broom again?

301
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,660
What happened to the rules?

302
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
It happens all the time.

303
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,900
If I catch you again...

304
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,900
Even when she gets angry,

305
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,980
she still looks gorgeous.

306
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,300
What is your problem?

307
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,020
Kan has faith in you,

308
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,060
but what are you doing?

309
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,900
Don't get distracted.

310
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,140
Just don't get distracted.

311
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,140
Luo Zhusi must be behind this.

312
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,740
I should check at her place.

313
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,980
Where does Luo Zhusi live?

314
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,540
(Vast and Clear)

315
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,460
Madam.

316
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,380
Ai Sixi's cousin

317
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,900
is hiding in our yard.

318
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,740
I don't know what's wrong with him.

319
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,340
He's muttering something

320
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,780
about height

321
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,340
and great martial arts.

322
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,980
I think he's looking for someone.

323
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,900
How did he already know

324
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,980
we were behind this?

325
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,860
In this case,

326
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,740
we're naturally suspected.

327
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,980
Since he is here,

328
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,020
he won't leave empty-handed.

329
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,340
Did you alert him?

330
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,460
That guy

331
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,580
looks insane.

332
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,340
We're afraid to approach him.

333
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,180
Around Taiping County,

334
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,660
only the tea trees on Beiyuan Mountain

335
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,740
grow in the best condition.

336
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,540
Beiyuan Mountain

337
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
has a different climate

338
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,740
from other places.

339
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,140
The valleys here remain moist

340
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,620
all year round.

341
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,660
It's still cold at noon.

342
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
So, it's perfect

343
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,740
for the growth of tea trees.

344
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,260
You really know a lot about tea leaves.

345
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,220
Mr. An is her grandfather.

346
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,620
She certainly knows this much.

347
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,460
Don't think

348
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,500
you're inferior

349
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
because she knows more.

350
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,980
I'm not thinking like that.

351
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,380
You are.

352
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,980
I'm not.

353
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,020
Then why did you say that?

354
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,980
You definitely...

355
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,020
How about this, An Wanqing?

356
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,100
You go over there.

357
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,340
Sixi and I will search here.

358
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,780
You...

359
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,140
What are you doing?

360
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,740
She's out here to help us.

361
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,980
Treat her more nicely.

362
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,220
Why would I?

363
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,740
She's really not my type.

364
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,500
What are you talking about?

365
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,500
Come on.

366
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,620
There's nothing between us.

367
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,620
Who said there was a thing?

368
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,340
What are you covering up?

369
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
Nothing.

370
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,220
Is there really a thing between you?

371
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,220
How could it be?

372
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,380
Your look quite stiff now.

373
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,340
Me?

374
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,300
Taking it seriously?

375
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,260
Stop playing cool.

376
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,100
Come on.

377
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,460
Whether there's a thing between you,

378
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,780
don't call her by her full name.

379
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,700
That's impolite.

380
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,980
Ai Sixi!

381
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,220
I found

382
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,380
a really good tea tree.

383
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,860
You guys come up here.

384
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,740
Alright.

385
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,580
See?

386
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,620
She also calls you that.

387
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,540
Don't always compete.

388
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,060
- Coming.
- Hurry.

389
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,220
- Where is it?
- It's here.

390
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,260
Look.

391
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,340
Jing Kan, come over.

392
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,220
Is this it?

393
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,860
He needs to see this.

394
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,780
This is it, huh?

395
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,180
Move faster.

396
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,540
Is this it?

397
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,180
Yes.

398
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,500
Why do you look

399
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,940
like this wasn't it?

400
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,140
Thank you, Wanqing,
for leading us to this tree.

401
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,580
In this case,

402
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,660
we're going to see Master Tea-gold.

403
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,940
Goodbye.

404
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,780
Let's go.

405
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,300
Do you know where he is?

406
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,490
- Didn't Mr. An tell us?
- No.

407
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,220
Grandfather asked me to take you there.

408
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,660
Is that necessary?

409
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,420
Please take us

410
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,620
to see him, then.

411
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,700
Fine.

412
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,860
Since you begged coquettishly,

413
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,140
I might as well

414
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,180
take you there.

415
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,460
Alright.

416
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,780
I begged?

417
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
When did I?

418
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,620
She's ridiculous.

419
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,500
Enough.

420
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,820
That's not a problem.

421
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,380
Don't get hung up on details.

422
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,500
Let's move.

423
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,820
Why do you also think I begged?

424
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,540
(Vast and Clear)

425
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,980
Cuiying.

426
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,420
You were asked
to give the soothing incense to Muyun.

427
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Why is it still here?

428
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,060
Did you forget that?

429
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,140
I delivered it to her.

430
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,940
But the door of her room was closed.

431
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,900
And...

432
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,020
I heard a man

433
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,020
talking in there.

434
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Afraid to disturb them,

435
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,620
I just came back.

436
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,660
Ridiculous.

437
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,580
How dare you gossip

438
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,900
about Ms. Xue?

439
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,420
You just forgot that.

440
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,380
Deliver it again when you have time.

441
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,540
Yes.

442
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,900
Ms. Xue?

443
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,300
You were scolded again?

444
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,460
Is it kept carefully?

445
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,060
What's wrong?

446
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
I love to sit here.

447
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,780
Let's go.

448
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,700
Alright.

449
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,020
Here we go.

450
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,580
Crybaby...

451
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm Jing Kan.

452
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,420
Please call me Jing Kan.

453
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,300
Fine. Kan, do you remember we...?

454
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,500
Jing Kan. It's Jing Kan.

455
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,580
Call me Jing Kan,

456
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
just like how I call you,

457
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,500
An Wanqing.

458
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,540
Fine, Jing Kan.

459
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,580
Do you remember why I called you that?

460
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,700
No, no, no.

461
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,660
I knew you wouldn't.

462
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,620
We were sitting together

463
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,700
and playing cat's cradle,

464
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,540
when you suddenly...

465
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,140
I remember it now.

466
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,220
You do, huh?

467
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,780
But was I braided at that time?

468
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
I can't remember.

469
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,700
I'm sleepy.

470
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,500
How come I'm so sleepy?

471
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,180
I'll get some sleep.

472
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,860
I'll sleep.

473
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,660
You know what? That was weird.

474
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,980
We were playing cat's cradle.

475
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,900
Suddenly, a snake

476
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,940
darted out in front of me.

477
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,140
- I was scared.
- You were?

478
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,020
But it didn't bite me.

479
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,060
It crept past me

480
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,900
to bite him.

481
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,780
He was so scared

482
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,100
and cried really hard.

483
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,620
How soon will we arrive?

484
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,220
We'll arrive soon.

485
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,540
Sleep now. I'll wake you up then.

486
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,220
Go on with that.

487
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,820
He held me tight immediately

488
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,900
and his head

489
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,020
pressed against my face.

490
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,620
That was annoying.

491
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,060
Then, I didn't know why,

492
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,940
but he put his legs

493
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,220
on me like this.

494
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,340
I feel really bad.

495
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,140
It's too bumpy. Let's switch seats.

496
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,980
Come on.

497
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,020
It's too bumpy here.

498
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,580
What happened later?

499
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,540
Be quiet, will you?

500
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,740
I feel terrible.

501
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,700
I get motion sickness.

502
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,860
Your mother sent me

503
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,140
to get some money from you.

504
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,380
But I sent her some last month.

505
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,380
She said your brother
was expecting a promotion soon

506
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,300
and more money was needed.

507
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,860
So, she sent me to get more.

508
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,940
Do all of you think

509
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,460
I'm a cash cow?

510
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,540
You keep asking for money.

511
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,500
When your brother gets promoted,

512
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,820
you'll be proud, too.

513
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,140
I've been hearing this
since I was little.

514
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,460
For him, I got married.

515
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,100
For him, I can't get remarried.

516
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,180
So far,

517
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,100
has anyone cared

518
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,380
if I'm living a good life?

519
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,820
If the promotion fails,

520
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,180
tell him to stop dreaming.

521
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,860
But...

522
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,220
How much do they want?

523
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,380
Your mother

524
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,780
wanted you

525
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,580
to get her a thousand taels.

526
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,140
A thousand?

527
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,700
What's he going to be,
Grand Secretariat?

528
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,780
Yeah.

529
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,220
The officials in the Capital

530
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,380
are really greedy.

531
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,300
They don't accept

532
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,100
a small amount.

533
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,380
I have no money.

534
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,140
Tell my father

535
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,460
to have another child.

536
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,420
Don't squeeze me alone.

537
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,100
You should go back.

538
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,060
I know of it.

539
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,620
Ms. Xue does have problems.

540
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,900
Mother,

541
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,780
did Mr. Wu ask you for money again?

542
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,220
No, no.

543
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,940
Don't deny it.

544
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,220
You know perfectly.

545
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,060
Every time he comes, he wants money.

546
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,940
Why don't you

547
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,060
just give me the money?

548
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,260
I can let you see

549
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,340
how I spend it.

550
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,820
But if you give it to them,

551
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,180
you'll lose the money

552
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,460
and the gratitude.

553
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,620
Come on.

554
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,620
How could you not respect them?

555
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Can I count on you

556
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,700
when I'm old?

557
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,100
I'm just angry.

558
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,120
Why does Grandfather favor Uncle

559
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,060
instead of you?

560
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,220
A family should help each other.

561
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,860
A soft heart ruins good luck.

562
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,260
Madam.

563
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,740
What's up?

564
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,260
When Mr. Wu came this afternoon,

565
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,820
I saw Guiwei eavesdrop by the corner.

566
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,380
Then I asked Mingnan about it.

567
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,460
He...

568
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,580
What must be kept from me?

569
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,980
What?

570
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,660
Luo Zhusi wants to pass

571
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,580
the blame to me?

572
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,500
What blame?

573
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,780
So, it's really her

574
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,860
who burned Kan's painting.

575
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,420
She wants me to be the scapegoat.

576
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,380
For what?

577
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,020
Why are you always so ignorant?

578
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,380
Look at your mother.

579
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
I have all kinds of problems.

580
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,180
Life is so hard for me.

581
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,820
I'm just worried about you.

582
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,860
You don't need to.

583
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,740
Madam,

584
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,540
we do have many secrets.

585
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,580
What if Guiwei hears us?

586
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,460
What secrets?

587
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,100
What secrets do you have?

588
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,380
Don't be annoying.

589
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,140
First, at Old Lady's birthday party...

590
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,820
Oh no. Shut up.

591
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,140
Other maids will stop

592
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,420
when their masters wink.

593
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,620
But you slip out everything.

594
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,460
Don't be Mingxia.

595
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,580
Be Ms. Loose-lipped.

596
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm not loose-lipped.

597
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,900
Get out of here.

598
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,060
She's just ignorant.

599
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
Don't be angry with her.

600
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,460
Or it may drive you mad.

601
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,660
Mother, if you ask me,

602
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,180
when Luo Zhusi can

603
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,700
shift the blame on us,

604
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,420
we can also shift it.

605
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,740
On whom?

606
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,260
The one

607
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,860
she cares most about.

608
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,620
She cares most about?

609
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,860
Who?

610
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,780
Come on.

611
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,300
Oh no.

612
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,180
I thought you knew it.

613
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,340
You sound so confident
as if you knew everything.

614
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,220
Here we are, at last.

615
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,180
Yeah.

616
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,140
You guys get in.

617
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,500
What about you?

618
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,780
I want to poop.

619
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,220
How about you do it in there?

620
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,340
There should be a privy.

621
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,460
This is our first visit.

622
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,340
That'd be offensive.

623
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,220
Yeah.

624
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,740
When you're near, I'll be worried.

625
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,180
Embarrassed, I mean.

626
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,420
Umm...

627
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,940
Shall I get in there

628
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,980
and introduce you guys?

629
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,620
No, no. Better let you go.

630
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,620
Take the letter of introduction.

631
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,100
My grandfather wrote it. I should go.

632
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,580
Alright. Stay safe.

633
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,860
Don't be nervous.

634
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,300
Let's go.

635
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,420
Is...Is that Master Tea-gold?

636
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,860
It doesn't seem likely.

637
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,420
Let me ask him.

638
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,860
Excuse me.

639
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,940
Is this where Master Tea-gold lives?

640
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,860
How can I help you?

641
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,420
This is the place.

642
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,340
Sorry to disturb you.

643
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,380
Here's the thing.

644
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,260
We're here

645
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,580
to see Master Tea-gold.

646
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,340
Please tell him about it.

647
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,860
What do you want?

648
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,980
Mr. An told us to come here.

649
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,620
This is his letter of introduction.

650
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,180
It's for Master Tea-gold.

651
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,620
I am Tea-gold.

652
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,180
Oh, he really is.

653
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,620
I'm a man

654
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,860
with a poor memory.

655
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,620
I only remember a few people.

656
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,020
My senior brother is included.

657
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,420
That's really great.

658
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,860
Thank you, Master Tea-gold.

659
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,820
Then shall we...?

660
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,380
How can I help you?

661
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,580
He's being way too forgetful.

662
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,020
Here's the thing.

663
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,940
Mr. An told us to come here

664
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,460
for you, Master Tea-gold.

665
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,740
My senior brother?

666
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,380
Any proof?

667
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,420
A letter from Mr. An.

668
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,980
What letter?

669
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,790
- It's...
- In your robe.

670
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
I'm a man

671
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
with a poor memory.

672
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,140
I only remember a few people.

673
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,620
My senior brother is included.

674
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,020
Come in, please.

675
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,980
Alright.

676
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,660
I'll keep the letter.

677
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,620
Let me keep it.

678
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,300
Alright. Come on.

679
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,500
You...

680
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,380
Mr. An sent us here.

681
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,860
Here's the letter.

682
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,220
I know.

683
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,220
I'm just asking

684
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,180
if you want some tea.

685
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,460
Yes, yes.

686
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,420
This is great.

687
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,420
Here's the thing.

688
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,380
Master,

689
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,300
I'm Jing Kan from Jinyu Tea.

690
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,620
I want to make Banfang Tea

691
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,140
for this year's Tea Contest.

692
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,300
So, we visit you,

693
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,020
hoping you can give us a hand.

694
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,820
Well...

695
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,540
Because my wife died,

696
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,700
I became a monk

697
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,460
and stayed away from the world.

698
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,940
Later, due to my poor memory,

699
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,940
the abbot advised to come back

700
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,060
and improve myself.

701
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,620
But as for myself,

702
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm no longer obsessed
with the victory thing.

703
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,060
So, I'm afraid

704
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,180
I'll make your trip

705
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,140
for nothing.

706
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,860
But we...

707
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,900
I can't offer too much.

708
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,860
Here's just some tea.

709
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,100
Thank you for coming all the way here.

710
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,540
Enjoy it, please.

711
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,060
Say something.

712
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,300
Anything.

713
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,500
Master,

714
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,980
I've never seen anyone

715
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,140
make tea with this tea set.

716
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,900
I use whatever is convenient.

717
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,300
Also...

718
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,140
We don't

719
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,620
make tea.

720
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,380
It should be "pour".

721
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,900
Pour some tea.

722
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,820
- Pour?
- Pour?

723
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,180
Let's taste it.

724
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,420
Alright.

725
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,260
Poured.

726
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,780
I have to say.

727
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,140
This is the best tea

728
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,620
I've ever tasted.

729
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,380
Yunlan Cangsong.

730
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,500
It's tea that people say

731
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,540
as precious as gold.

732
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,620
Master,

733
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,380
why does it taste so fresh?

734
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,180
The tea leaves are fresh.

735
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,100
The way to pour it matters too.

736
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,700
The Sage of Tea
has a saying of three boils.

737
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,860
The first boil is like fish eyes.

738
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,220
There's a little sound.

739
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,380
The second boil
is like gushing spring water.

740
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,380
The third boil is like surging waves.

741
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,460
But the tea buds

742
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,540
are way too delicate.

743
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,700
The tea won't taste fresh

744
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,020
until the water stops boiling

745
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,100
before the boiling point.

746
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,380
Master,

747
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,380
I want to learn to make tea.

748
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,660
Please instruct me.

749
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,380
What are you doing?

750
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,860
I told you I wouldn't interfere.

751
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,100
Master,

752
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,340
don't bother to teach him a lot.

753
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,020
Just teach him to make Banfang Tea.

754
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,380
He doesn't do this for himself.

755
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,540
He wants to regain his mother's glory.

756
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,460
Yes.

757
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,980
Fine, then.

758
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,940
For your mother's sake,

759
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,020
I won't reject you.

760
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,380
Before you learn,

761
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,300
you must read some books.

762
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,660
Well, you wait here.

763
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,620
I'll fetch them for you.

764
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,940
Alright.

765
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,740
There's hope.

766
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,460
You know what? No one

767
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,660
but Master Tea-gold

768
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,620
makes Yunlan Cangsong.

769
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,620
So, now you believe, huh?

770
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,540
It must be him.

771
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,460
We're right.

772
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,900
He's back.

773
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,580
Who are you guys?

774
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,420
What? We...

775
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,740
Why are you kneeling here?

776
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,100
- We...
- Get out.

777
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,940
Take out the letter.

778
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,340
Who are you? Get out.

779
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,100
- Sixi, I'm back.
- Let me read it.

780
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,660
You're back. Here, Master.

781
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,620
Master, huh?

782
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,300
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Wen?

783
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,220
You're back.

784
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,460
I'm not.

785
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
I'm Mr. An's grandchild.

786
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,580
My name is An Wanqing.

787
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,860
He must be mistaken.

788
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,220
I'm sorry.

789
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,140
You look

790
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,700
like my late wife.

791
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,340
Sorry, I have the wrong person.

792
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,940
It's alright. I'm honored.

793
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,260
I really am.

794
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,220
Stand there.

795
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,380
Who are they?

796
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,500
- Why here?
- Letter.

797
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,100
Get out of here.

798
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,620
- I'll explain to you.
- Get out.

799
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,620
Let me explain!

800
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,820
I'll explain to you.

801
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,140
Fine. You get some rest.

802
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,180
She's coming out.

803
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,660
Wanqing, how was it going?

804
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,500
Don't worry. He'll teach you.

805
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,700
Brilliant.

806
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,300
Thank you, Wanqing.

807
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,980
Without you, our trip would be in vain.

808
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,220
Thank you.

809
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,460
I nearly slapped him.

810
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,500
Yeah. Look.

811
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,020
- What's wrong?
- High five.

812
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,420
What high five?

813
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,700
Nothing.

814
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,860
Luo Zhusi.

815
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,140
Xue Muyun.

816
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,700
Old Lady.

817
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,580
They're in this position.

818
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,460
And I...

819
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,140
This is me.

820
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,380
Yes. This is my position.

821
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,940
Do you know

822
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,340
a painting in Anping Bridge Shop

823
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,460
was burned the other day?

824
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,060
I know, of course.

825
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,900
So, what exactly happened?

826
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,660
I can tell you,
but don't tell anyone else.

827
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,780
I won't tell anyone.

828
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,900
Young Master Aji

829
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,220
has been back recently.

830
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,940
That night,

831
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,060
I saw him come back really late.

832
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,300
And he burned something.

833
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,420
Do you think he's...?

834
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,540
Walls have ears.

835
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,660
Let's talk over there.

836
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,660
Luo Aji?

837
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:46,140
(Fu's Restaurant)

838
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,940
Waiter, the bill, please.

839
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,780
Down there.

840
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,820
Do you know what I did

841
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,780
last night?

842
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,900
You know what?

843
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,100
I can't

844
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
be very nice to her.

845
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,980
She offended me.

846
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,940
What should we men be like?

847
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,180
- What?
- What?

848
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,100
Sugarcane.

849
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,620
Sugarcane?

850
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,100
First sweet,

851
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,900
and then unfaithful.

852
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,500
Sweet and then unfaithful.

853
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,460
Indeed.

854
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,100
- Very wise.
- Sweet and unfaithful.

855
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Luo Aji.

856
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,420
Why are you here?

857
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,020
You said you had something to do.

858
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,100
So, it's drinking with them?

859
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,980
Yes.

860
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,300
Isn't it important?

861
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,180
Do you know when you're here,

862
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,580
you'll disgrace me?

863
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,700
You have to do this, huh?

864
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,660
What do you want, then?

865
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,100
Come out. Let's talk.

866
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,020
I'm not going.

867
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,820
Can't you see I'm drinking?

868
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,660
You don't come out, huh?

869
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Believe it or not,

870
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,580
I'll drown myself now.

871
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,060
Aji,

872
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,300
will you go check on her?

873
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,420
Ignore her.

874
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Is it appropriate?

875
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,180
What if she really...?

876
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,260
It's alright. Don't bother.

877
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,420
No, no, no.

878
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,540
I'll go check on her.

879
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,580
If she really dies,

880
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,540
there will be problems.

881
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,460
I should go.

882
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,740
What's his hurry?

883
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,300
That's really unnecessary.

884
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,140
Let's go on drinking.

885
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,060
Cheers.

886
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,540
How shameless.

887
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
You don't have feelings

888
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,420
for him anymore, do you?

889
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,620
I'm actually here for you.

890
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,940
I know.

891
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,100
That's why I came out.

892
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,460
But when on earth will you

893
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,500
break up with him?

894
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Zeng.

895
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,020
Wait a bit longer.

896
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,820
I just want you

897
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,500
to know

898
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
I have feelings for you.

899
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,820
I certainly know.

900
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,100
I just...

901
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,620
It's too hard for you.

902
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,460
There's always one trick for women.

903
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,620
Which trick?

904
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,140
Do nothing...

905
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,260
Do nothing...

906
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,180
Until she calms down.

907
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,340
Do nothing until she calms down.

908
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,140
Brilliant.

909
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,260
You're quite insightful.

910
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,060
Here. A toast to you.

911
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,700
I chased but lost track of her.

912
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
I knew it.

913
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,580
She's always like that.

914
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,980
Come on. Let's drink.

915
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,060
Come on.

916
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,780
No more wine.

917
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,420
Waiter, another pot of wine.

918
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
I'll go get it.

919
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,260
- No.
- You just sit here.

920
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,500
- Waiter.
- It's alright.

921
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,700
- Waiter.
- I'll go get it.

922
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,580
There must be sufficient wine.

923
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,380
Isn't it wine?

924
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,660
Actually,

925
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,780
it's not that I don't like her.

926
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,100
But I want to give her a lesson

927
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,420
and she'll know she can't mess with me.

928
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,420
Smart guy.

929
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,740
I get it now.

930
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,140
I can't bear it.

931
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,180
I'll break up with him!

932
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,020
Don't be so impulsive.

933
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,140
If you really break up with him,

934
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,790
who else will give us money,

935
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,660
right?

936
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,980
So, this is how you treat me.

937
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,020
Let me tell you.

938
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,340
Zeng likes me, too.

939
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,180
If you don't want me,

940
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,060
I'll be with him.

941
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,060
Honey,

942
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,300
don't try to piss me off.

943
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,540
I was just kidding.

944
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,020
Stop being angry,

945
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,340
will you?

946
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
I'm going up there.

947
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,260
What took him so long?

948
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,620
The wine is served really slowly.

949
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,170
Come on, Aji.

950
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,020
Let me fill your cup.

951
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,980
Here.

952
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,980
- Come on.
- Here, Zeng.

953
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,660
