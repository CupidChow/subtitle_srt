Kan.

26
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,920
This place is a bit remote.

27
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,640
You don't understand.

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,310
Masters like them

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,320
basically live in places like this.

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,360
Where is it?

31
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,070
Is anyone here?

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,920
Where are your manners?

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,110
Tea Master, nice to meet you.

34
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,950
I came unannounced.

35
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,410
The door wasn't properly closed.

36
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,350
So...

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,040
Thank you.

38
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,920
When boiling water,

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,640
if bubbles appear like shrimp eyes,

40
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,760
the water is boiling but not overcooked.

41
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,480
Cai Junmo believes

42
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,880
overcooked water
isn't fit for brewing tea.

43
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,830
As expected of the Tea Master.

44
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,320
You're clearly an expert.

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,830
I feel he's a bit pretentious.

46
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,270
Masters are like that.

47
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,550
Put down Tao Baowen.

48
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,640
That's the teacup you took.

49
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,880
If you break it,
you can't afford to compensate.

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,360
This even has a name?

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,010
The Song people named

52
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,380
twelve tea utensils

53
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,390
based on official titles,

54
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,480
so they are called the 12 Courtiers.

55
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,080
The one you took is Tao Baowen.

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,190
Kan, can you understand this?

57
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,890
Tea Master,

58
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,010
I came unannounced today

59
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,990
because I have a request.

60
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,920
Meeting is fate.

61
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,320
Since you came
while I was boiling water,

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,760
you're my guest.

63
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,060
When it comes to whisking tea,

64
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,360
though the techniques differ,

65
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,950
the principles are the same.

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,880
If the stirring is weak

67
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,230
or the amount of water is insufficient,

68
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,270
the tea won't mix properly,
and the fragrance disperses.

69
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,560
If the water is too much

70
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,220
or the wrist movement is not rounded,

71
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,470
the tea's strength is lost,
and froth forms easily.

72
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,240
Tea has true fragrance,

73
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,760
but it must be steamed and pressed,

74
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,830
dried and ground,

75
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,880
and ground finely and whisked.

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,350
Only then can its clear aroma spread,

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,350
and its harmony and beauty be complete.

78
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,350
Thank you.

79
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,840
Taste it.

80
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,660
How is it?

81
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,680
This tea is indeed

82
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,600
quite ordinary.

83
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,350
Let me try.

84
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,250
It's drinkable.

85
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,190
Right?

86
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,350
Tea Master,

87
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,080
we are not saying your tea is bad.

88
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,930
But we are not very familiar

89
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,880
with whisking tea.

90
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,470
Usually, the tea we drink

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,220
is brewed.

92
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,280
Yes.

93
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,440
You're forgetting the tradition.

94
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,950
Though brewing is convenient,

95
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,670
does it have

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,800
any aesthetic value?

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,560
Tea whisking

98
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,950
is traditional

99
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,560
and has a deep history.

100
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,580
Even people from Ryukyu

101
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,680
study our method.

102
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,980
How can we

103
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,710
forget it so easily?

104
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,710
You are right.

105
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,300
We can't forget our tradition.

106
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,660
But not everyone has the conditions

107
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,510
to sit down quietly

108
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,680
and whisk a cup of tea.

109
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,000
I think if tea is to develop well,

110
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
more people need

111
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,200
to experience its quality

112
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,680
in a simpler way.

113
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,910
It seems you know quite a lot

114
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,150
about tea.

115
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,840
Tea Master, here's the thing.

116
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,000
May I ask if you have

117
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,410
any of the finest

118
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,080
pan-fired tea?

119
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,550
Why?

120
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,780
We want to get a batch

121
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,800
to sell in our shop.

122
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,670
No.

123
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,020
Actually, we...

124
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,960
I don't have any.

125
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,080
Sorry to trouble you.

126
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,560
Guiwei, let's go.

127
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,790
Kan...

128
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,000
You didn't even respect Jinyu Tea,

129
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,590
and you're the Tea Master?

130
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,120
Don't say that.

131
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,840
Wait.

132
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,560
You are from Jinyu Tea?

133
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,750
Yes.

134
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,350
Jinyu Tea

135
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,120
is famous for pan-fired tea.

136
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,240
Actually, pan-firing has existed

137
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,470
since ancient times,

138
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,250
but it was popularized

139
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,610
by Monk Da Fang,

140
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,590
who made Songluo Tea.

141
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,780
I've heard of him.

142
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,920
My mother told me about him.

143
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,350
I have five jin of the finest bud tea.

144
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,300
It is pan-fired using the secret method

145
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,600
of Monk Da Fang's Songluo Tea.

146
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,640
I wonder

147
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,120
if you are interested.

148
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,720
Of course.

149
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,440
Then I will reluctantly

150
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,000
sell some to you.

151
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,270
Kan, do we want it?

152
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,000
Actually, I have some connection

153
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,800
with Jinyu Tea.

154
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,810
Consider it my way of repaying a favor.

155
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,520
Repaying a favor?

156
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,700
Don't ask.

157
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,640
Guiwei, don't ask.

158
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,490
Everyone has some

159
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,760
unpleasant past.

160
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,430
We respect that.

161
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,730
We respect that.

162
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,780
Kan, I didn't want to ask.

163
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,720
Even if you did,

164
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,380
I wouldn't tell.

165
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,460
But I have two conditions.

166
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,100
First,

167
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,300
if you don't sell it

168
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,780
within three days,

169
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,300
I will take the tea back.

170
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,860
Second,

171
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,580
pay first.

172
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Kan,

173
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,460
100 taels for five jin of tea,

174
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,220
and it must be paid first.

175
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,540
You agreed so easily?

176
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,930
It seems Tea Master

177
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,880
doesn't quite understand

178
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,180
his influence in the tea world.

179
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,740
What do you mean?

180
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,300
I don't just want the Songluo Tea

181
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,740
but also his reputation.

182
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,460
Beiju Master, Nan Master, and he

183
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,020
are top figures in the tea world.

184
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,480
People would pay 200 taels

185
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,820
for the five jin of tea,

186
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,180
let alone just 100 taels.

187
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,260
Really?

188
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,740
I want to shock those

189
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,300
who look down on me.

190
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Alright, Kan.

191
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,260
Good that you're confident.

192
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,180
I also realized
you really know a lot about tea.

193
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,180
I've been influenced since childhood.

194
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,340
I will study seriously.

195
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,500
I won't let you

196
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,420
and my cousin down.

197
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,700
Trust me.

198
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,820
Guiwei,

199
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm really relieved by this.

200
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,540
Do you have 100 taels of silver?

201
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,300
Hurry, we need it now.

202
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,080
I'm afraid he will regret it.

203
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,820
We must finalize this deal first.

204
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,900
So, you don't have money?

205
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,340
After this deal is done,

206
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,020
I'll give you 150 taels.

207
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,300
No, it's not about 150 taels.

208
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
You now...

209
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,020
You are the shop manager.

210
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,180
We need to work together

211
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,900
to make it big and strong, right?

212
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,820
Besides,

213
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,060
I've already said it.

214
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,660
If my shop fails in three months,

215
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,700
it will close.

216
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,580
Will you still be able to manage it?

217
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,660
Can I pay back the money

218
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,580
I owe your cousin?

219
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,700
What can we do then?

220
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,620
Sell fish like that kid?

221
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,540
I won't sell fish.

222
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,020
I only have a few taels of silver.

223
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,300
But my cousin's money is with me.

224
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,000
How much does your cousin have?

225
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,900
It should be enough.

226
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,100
Every time I needed help the most,

227
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,940
it was Sixi who helped me.

228
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,260
Thinking about it, I really miss her.

229
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,620
Run?

230
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,940
You wanted to run?

231
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,540
Now, you know better?

232
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,060
When you go out,

233
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,860
will you uphold a wife's duty,

234
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,020
respect your husband,
and be grateful to your in-laws?

235
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,180
Move.

236
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,900
Why is he here?

237
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
He's even at the door.

238
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,420
Sixi.

239
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Sixi?

240
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,980
Here!

241
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,740
Quiet!

242
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,540
Sixi.

243
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,180
Sixi.

244
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,180
Mr. Jing.

245
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,540
Here.

246
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,340
Well.

247
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,300
What's that sound?

248
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,540
Someone is slaughtering a sow.

249
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,300
We'll eat pork knuckles for lunch.

250
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,420
Pork knuckles for lunch?

251
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,460
Why not join us?

252
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,380
I'll pass.

253
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,140
I just want to see Sixi.

254
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,420
Bad timing.

255
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,020
Sixi went to arrange flowers.

256
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,940
Why not join us?

257
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,780
No need.

258
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,660
Is she doing well?

259
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,540
She's eating well,

260
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,940
gaining some weight.

261
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,020
That's good.

262
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,200
By the way, I brought Sixi

263
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
her favorite lotus pastries

264
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,660
and lotus root pudding.

265
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,420
Please give them to her.

266
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,820
- Okay.
- This is for you.

267
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,900
A little gesture.

268
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,220
I have some, too?

269
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,320
Please take it.

270
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,620
You are too kind.

271
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,540
Mr. Jing.

272
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,620
By the way,

273
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,500
there's one more thing

274
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,460
to tell Sixi.

275
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,380
Well.

276
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,020
I borrowed the 100 taels

277
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,940
she left with Guiwei.

278
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,300
You're being silly.

279
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,180
Her money is your money.

280
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,420
Just use it.

281
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,380
How sensible of you.

282
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,860
Quiet.

283
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,140
Shut up!

284
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,820
Quiet.

285
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,140
Is that the sound of a sow?

286
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,340
A wild boar.

287
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,220
A wild boar?

288
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,180
No wonder it sounds so lively.

289
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,620
Then I won't disturb you.

290
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,860
I'll take my leave.

291
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,980
Take care.

292
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,900
Pork for lunch.

293
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,100
How nice.

294
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,820
Take care, Young Master.

295
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,940
Alright.

296
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,260
You want to call, huh?

297
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,820
You want to call?

298
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,100
Let her shout.

299
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,140
He's already far away.

300
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,860
Desperate?

301
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,460
The one you love was at the door,

302
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,860
but you couldn't see him.

303
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,660
What did you say?

304
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,660
I said

305
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,980
he couldn't use the money.

306
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,180
You haven't learned anything at all.

307
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,620
You're married to him.

308
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,900
Forget about the money.

309
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,100
I want...

310
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,260
You want what?

311
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,380
I want to bite you.

312
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,660
Hold on, Zhu.

313
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,140
Stop it!

314
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,980
You, little brat.

315
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,060
How dare you bite me?

316
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,180
(Jinyu Tea)

317
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,340
Why hasn't Tea Master's tea

318
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,460
arrived yet?

319
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,180
Kan.

320
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,700
Kan, something's wrong.

321
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,420
What happened?

322
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,340
The tea...

323
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,740
I went to the Tea Master's courtyard
to urge the tea,

324
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,660
but

325
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,060
it was empty.

326
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,900
What?

327
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,820
I...

328
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,500
Kan, hurry.

329
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,900
There's nothing left.

330
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,580
The Tea Master

331
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,600
turns out to be a fraud.

332
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
Kan, do you think

333
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,340
he was the true Tea Master?

334
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,100
Not good.

335
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,500
We've been scammed.

336
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,860
Guiwei,

337
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,060
look around and see

338
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,660
if we can find this fake Tea Master.

339
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,680
I'll go find that fish-selling kid.

340
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,540
The fish-selling trickster.

341
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,940
See, you're so anxious.

342
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,500
Go.

343
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,060
Fish boy.

344
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,700
He even believed a kid.

345
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,140
He's so gullible.

346
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,060
I knew long ago
that the Tea Master was a fraud,

347
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,740
so I used it.

348
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,700
Do you know what this trick is called?

349
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,340
It's called the trick of a kid.

350
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,580
Who's he?

351
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,380
He's the kid.

352
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,660
I mean,

353
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,580
why are you laughing here?

354
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,940
Without me, could you have done this?

355
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,180
Yes, yes.

356
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,540
Liu,

357
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,140
did you do the thing

358
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
you promised me?

359
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Don't worry.

360
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,300
We've avenged your sister.

361
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,340
Ai Sixi, who fooled your sister,

362
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,780
has been sent to Yuanyang House.

363
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,540
Cuiying arranged for someone

364
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,380
to take care of her.

365
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,540
Now, she's probably dying.

366
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Let's have a drink.

367
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,340
- Cheers.
- What did you say?

368
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,140
What happened to Sixi?

369
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,060
This...

370
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm just a kid.

371
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,580
They made me do it.

372
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,860
Mother!

373
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,780
(Yuanyang House)
Discipline yourselves.

374
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,860
Pay attention to your words.

375
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,820
Sixi.

376
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,740
Who are you?

377
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,620
Sixi.

378
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,940
Breathe.

379
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,220
So hot.

380
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,420
It's gone.

381
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,380
All my money is gone.

382
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,380
Still alive.

383
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,300
Not dead yet.

384
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,140
Not dead.

385
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,660
She scared me to death.

386
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,340
Sixi.

387
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,820
Mr. Jing.

388
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,660
Sixi, Sixi.

389
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,260
Untie her!

390
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,900
- Okay.
- I can leave?

391
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,860
I can leave?

392
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,500
Sixi.

393
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,860
So thirsty.

394
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,140
- I'll take you out.
- I want water.

395
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,180
- I want water.
- Sixi.

396
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,820
Jing Kan.

397
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,220
Sixi.

398
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,580
Give me back my money.

399
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,300
Money? Not now.

400
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,660
Just wait.

401
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,760
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

402
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,620
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

403
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,860
I won't talk back...

404
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,700
I'll fight you!

405
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,420
Sixi,

406
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,540
you're awake.

407
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,580
Guiwei.

408
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,460
There really is hell in this world,

409
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,820
and it's just two streets away.

410
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,060
Sixi, are you feeling better?

411
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
Where's my money?

412
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Tell me.

413
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,060
Sixi.

414
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,940
Sixi.

415
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,280
Don't worry.

416
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,220
I already sent someone

417
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,560
to deliver the approval documents

418
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,300
from Grandmother.

419
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,100
Rest well at home.

420
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,020
No one will hurt you.

421
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,300
Don't think about anything else.

422
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,220
Don't overthink.

423
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,660
Sixi, what do you need?

424
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,020
I need to leave here immediately.

425
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,700
Get up first.

426
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,700
Sixi.

427
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,940
I didn't expect that Luo Zhusi

428
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,660
had arranged things in Yuanyang House.

429
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,940
Don't worry.

430
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,420
I will not spare her.

431
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,140
Please spare me first.

432
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,060
I beg you.

433
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,540
Guiwei,

434
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,900
give me back my money.

435
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,820
Sixi,

436
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,620
we were scammed.

437
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,980
The money's gone.

438
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,220
All gone?

439
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,020
Sixi, sit for a moment.

440
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,060
Give it back to me.

441
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,540
That's my life's savings.

442
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,420
Give it back to me!

443
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Give it back now.

444
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
From now on,

445
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,340
our paths are separate.

446
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
Your foot injury hasn't healed yet.

447
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,620
Don't add a new one.

448
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,860
Please, give it back.

449
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,220
Give it back.

450
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,180
Here.

451
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,900
Just 30 wen.

452
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,660
Sorry, Sixi.

453
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,500
It's really

454
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
my fault.

455
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,340
I aimed too high.

456
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
I was too ambitious.

457
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,100
And I failed to protect you.

458
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,780
You didn't have

459
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,740
to leave.

460
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,740
- Sixi.
- Sixi.

461
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,140
Sixi...

462
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,380
Don't follow me.

463
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:10,500
(Jing Residence)

464
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,260
Ma'am,

465
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,760
do you need a sedan chair?

466
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,620
Come on.

467
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,740
Take it slow.

468
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,300
Ma'am, where are we going?

469
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,180
Leave first.

470
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,100
Alright.

471
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,380
Kan, she left.

472
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,660
Why didn't you stop her?

473
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,900
What right do I have?

474
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,260
How did I end up like this?

475
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,060
No money to spend,

476
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,620
nowhere to go,

477
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,620
and no home to return.

478
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,340
Sixi,

479
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,180
I didn't mean to give him the money.

480
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,780
I thought you two were close.

481
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,340
Close my foot.

482
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,980
Sixi, wipe it off.

483
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Go away.

484
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,340
I think Kan is very good.

485
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,580
I think he's sincere with you.

486
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,140
How much is sincerity worth?

487
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,820
It can't even get me half a bun.

488
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,780
Why am I so unlucky?

489
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
What were you thinking?

490
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,620
I don't know.

491
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,900
At that moment, I just gave him

492
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,940
the money somehow.

493
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,140
I've saved it for so long,

494
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,740
and it's gone

495
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
in no time.

496
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,420
Then why did you give it to me?

497
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,340
I...

498
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,260
Even your death won't calm my anger.

499
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,420
Go ahead, beat me.

500
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,980
It's all my fault.

501
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,380
(Anping Bridge)

502
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,140
(Jinyu Tea)

503
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,740
Sir,

504
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,120
do you have Yunjiaojin Tea?

505
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,380
Sorry, no.

506
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,180
Isn't this Jinyu Tea?

507
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,500
We mainly sell Jinyu Tea,

508
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,420
not tea.

509
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,700
We have all kinds of teas,

510
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,620
except for those from Jinyu Tea.

511
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,220
They're all there. Pick yourself.

512
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,740
Forget it.

513
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,860
You look so down.

514
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,740
Who'd buy tea from you?

515
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,660
Sixi.

516
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,540
Sixi, you...

517
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,660
It's good that you're back.

518
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,940
Guiwei.

519
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,060
Your IOU.

520
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,420
Give it to me first.

521
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,060
I'll sign it later.

522
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,340
I still want to leave,

523
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,460
but you owe me money,

524
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,020
so leaving now would be a loss.

525
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,660
Totally understood.

526
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,260
I heard from Guiwei

527
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,920
that you borrowed money from Grandmother

528
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,620
to buy the tea.

529
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,900
Yes.

530
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,500
Why didn't you borrow before?

531
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,220
I had sworn

532
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,120
never to use a cent
of the family's money.

533
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,660
Now, I see I was naive.

534
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,500
You swore never to use it,

535
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,540
not never to borrow.

536
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,420
Right.

537
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,380
I only realized this

538
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,420
after I met you.

539
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,980
Sixi,

540
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,540
please stay by my side

541
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,700
and teach me.

542
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,300
Don't give me that.

543
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,620
But indeed,

544
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,700
Luo Wuchang controls the tea plantation

545
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,620
and won't give us tea.

546
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,620
This shop, then, is like an empty shell.

547
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,400
Half of the three-month bet period

548
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,220
has already passed.

549
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,820
If I don't go get some tea from outside,

550
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,020
won't that be giving up already?

551
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,220
Kan,

552
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,140
why not just

553
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,320
report her to the Old Lady?

554
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,540
Wouldn't that make it look

555
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,380
like I'm helpless?

556
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,740
Aren't you already helpless?

557
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,660
Alright.

558
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,260
Jing Kan has a point.

559
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,120
So what if we report her?

560
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
She could secretly mix in

561
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,380
inferior leaves.

562
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,600
We can't guard against it all.

563
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,380
If you ask me,

564
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,380
not getting tea
from the Jing tea plantation

565
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,380
is actually a good thing.

566
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,740
A couple thinks alike.

567
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,820
It's just running a shop.

568
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,260
What's so difficult?

569
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,340
Sixi,

570
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,980
with you here, I feel at ease.

571
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,420
Sixi, we'll follow your lead.

572
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,620
Just tell us what to do.

573
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,700
What to do?

574
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,900
We'll start from the first step.

575
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,260
Okay.

576
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,660
What is

577
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,580
the first step?

578
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,660
Know our enemy.

579
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,500
(Jinyu Tea Plantation)

580
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,460
Next month,

581
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,500
as long as each of you puts in

582
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,940
10% more effort than this month,

583
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,660
then your income will...

584
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,980
Increase by 10%?

585
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,820
No, it will be especially stable.

586
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,020
(Sweet and Fragrant Tea)

587
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,380
Stretch out your hands.

588
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,900
Clench your fists.

589
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,980
Shout our slogan.

590
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,420
Jinyu Tea looks green.

591
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,340
Jinyu Tea looks green.

592
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,580
And tastes better.

593
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,260
And tastes better.

594
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,580
Jinyu Tea looks green.

595
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,020
Jinyu Tea looks green.

596
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,260
And tastes better.

597
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,780
And tastes better.

598
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,700
(Jinyu Tea)
Jinyu Tea looks green and tastes better.

599
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,780
Get to work.

600
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,980
Mr. Yu, Mr. Yu.

601
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,780
Don't rush to leave yet.

602
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,820
Mr. Yu, Mr. Yu.

603
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,780
What do you want to say?

604
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,800
Wait.

605
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,160
Mr. Yu.

606
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,110
What do you want to say?

607
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,060
Let's chat.

608
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,460
Why leave just after arriving?

609
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,380
Ask him.

610
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,300
Well, Mr. Yu wants

611
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,500
to buy Yunjiaojin at five qian per jin.

612
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,540
Why didn't you say how much I need?

613
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,020
Mr. Wang,

614
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,940
as you know,

615
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,260
I used to use

616
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,820
Longwochun from Laolongtan.

617
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,100
Your Yunjiaojin

618
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,540
can't compare with Longwochun,

619
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,620
- but we're friends, right?
- Right.

620
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,460
I'm here to help your business.

621
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,260
You don't even let me have five qian.

622
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,580
That's unfair.

623
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,140
Mr. Yu.

624
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,860
Look, we've always sold

625
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,340
Yunjiaojin

626
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,220
at one tael per jin.

627
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,340
You offer five qian?

628
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,780
You're making things hard for us.

629
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,660
Just five qian per jin.

630
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,860
No more.

631
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,740
I'll go to Laolongtan then.

632
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,660
Wait a moment.

633
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
Mr. Yu,

634
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,660
how about this?

635
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,700
I can't decide

636
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,300
the price,

637
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,100
but if you buy ten jin,

638
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,140
I'll personally give you

639
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,660
five boxes of tea snacks.

640
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,220
The festival is coming.

641
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,820
It's perfect

642
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,740
for visiting relatives.

643
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,340
- Right?
- That's true.

644
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,260
Besides,

645
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,180
our tea snacks

646
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,580
aren't cheap.

647
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,440
Mr. Wang,

648
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,460
you can't give them away.

649
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,100
We must give them!

650
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Don't worry about cost.

651
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,900
Go, wrap them for Mr. Yu.

652
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,760
- Okay.
- Hurry.

653
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
Later,

654
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,540
I'll send you some

655
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,220
of our newly developed tea.

656
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,260
You can try it first.

657
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,660
It can't be bought anywhere else.

658
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,420
Give me your feedback.

659
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,060
Wang,

660
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,380
you are

661
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,740
such a good friend.

662
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,340
When my new tavern opens,

663
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,900
I'll still use your tea.

664
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,450
Thank you.

665
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,340
We're friends.

666
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,260
Your tea snacks.

667
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,340
The tea snacks are good.

668
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,260
See you next time.

669
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,620
Goodbye.

670
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,060
Mr. Yu, take care.

671
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,980
Take care.

672
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,100
Mr. Wang.

673
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,460
That batch of tea snacks
has been stored for a long time.

674
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,380
They might be spoiled.

675
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,580
Does it say when they were made?

676
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,700
No.

677
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,500
Then it's fine.

678
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,820
(Wonton)

679
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,540
So, that's how tea is sold.

680
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,060
You said we should know our enemy.

681
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,900
Could it be you want

682
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,420
to poach Mr. Wang?

683
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,500
Sixi, we have a manager now.

684
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,740
Why poach him?

685
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,100
He works for Luo Zhusi.

686
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,940
Poaching him would be like inviting...

687
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,180
A wolf into the house.

688
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,780
Exactly, that's what I mean.

689
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,700
I'm telling you.

690
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,620
This man is deceitful.

691
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,700
Stay away from him.

692
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,180
But on the other hand,

693
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,940
we do need a manager

694
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,220
who knows how to run a shop.

695
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,020
Kan, I can run a shop.

696
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,460
Indeed, talent is rare.

697
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,550
Isn't it running poorly now?

698
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

699
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,140
- I...
- The rain is getting heavier.

700
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,620
I can do it, Sixi.

701
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,940
- Let me.
- You two...

702
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,860
Let's go.

703
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,180
Why is the rain so heavy?

704
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,620
Wait for me, you two.

705
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,620
(Noodles, Anping Bridge,
Jinyu Tea Plantation)

706
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,540
What to eat?

707
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,740
Anything is fine.

708
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,640
Sir, three bowls of noodles.

709
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,620
All with eggs.

710
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,040
I'll have one more meatball.

711
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,960
Alright.

712
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,140
Sixi, shall we change seats?

713
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,340
It's too sunny over there.

714
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,140
No need, I'm fine.

715
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,500
What is this?

716
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,220
I was

717
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,380
just thinking.

718
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,740
If we want to run this shop well,

719
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,860
there are two things to do.

720
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,060
First, we need to learn

721
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,380
how to sell tea.

722
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,660
Second, we must have

723
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,380
better tea than others.

724
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,020
But where can we find

725
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,940
better tea?

726
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,940
The tea we currently stock

727
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,300
is basically the kind

728
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,780
all tea shops in Taiping County sell.

729
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,020
Good tea

730
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,140
is usually sold exclusively.

731
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,380
We now have the Jinyu Tea sign,

732
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,060
so there's no chance for cooperation.

733
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,460
But we shouldn't be discouraged.

734
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,580
At least we learned today

735
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,140
that the enemy isn't very strong.

736
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,020
Alright.

737
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,260
Two bowls of noodles, enjoy.

738
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,180
Thank you.

739
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,420
(Retired and Principled)

740
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,800
Though we're inexperienced
in running the shop,

741
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,640
our shop is finally open.

742
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,900
We have to thank you for your support.

743
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Really.

744
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,620
Mr. An, you truly give us

745
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,020
a second life.

746
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,340
This term isn't used like that.

747
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,260
It's meant that way.

748
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,060
Not calling me old man?

749
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,580
With your talent,

750
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,940
how could I call you old man?

751
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,540
I'm surely not a smooth talker.

752
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,460
Really.

753
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,420
Mr. An,

754
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,060
look at this Gongchun teapot.

755
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,580
It was left by my mother.

756
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,420
I heard Da Bin made it.

757
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,860
In the past hundred years,

758
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,340
teapots were made of silver,
tin, and porcelain,

759
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,300
but Yixing pottery was still preferred,

760
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,660
because Yixing local clay

761
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,660
brings out the true fragrance of tea

762
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,060
and allows tea not to spoil overnight.

763
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,180
As for whether it was made by Da Bin,

764
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,540
it's said

765
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,820
that Da Bin's teapots

766
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,420
are marked by a thumbprint
on the handle.

767
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,740
It really is.

768
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,860
Mr. An,

769
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,900
I have long admired your talent.

770
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,260
Though I'm average,

771
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,580
I sincerely hope

772
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,660
to study with you

773
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,300
the art of running a tea business.

774
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,420
Mr. An, please accept me

775
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,820
as your disciple.

776
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,900
Jing Kan,

777
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,180
why are you so polite?

778
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,540
Mr. An isn't a stranger.

779
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,380
He was close to your mother.

780
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,780
He'll definitely accept you, right?

781
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,500
Hurry and kneel.

782
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,420
Yes, yes.

783
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,100
Sit, sit.

784
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,060
Have a seat.

785
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,140
We'll sit first.

786
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,060
Alright.

787
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,380
I've had

788
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,540
my final disciple.

789
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,780
Besides,

790
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,220
I don't have anything to teach you.

791
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,580
Mr. An, you're too modest.

792
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,660
I've heard

793
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,460
about Jinyu Tea's first order.

794
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,500
You sold

795
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,500
200 jin of tea

796
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,420
in just two hours.

797
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,780
Mr. An, please help us.

798
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,740
Mr. An, please.

799
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,900
Please.

800
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,700
Your teamwork

801
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,780
is putting me in a hard position.

802
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,940
Mr. An,

803
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,260
if you're willing to help us,

804
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,900
Jing Kan will serve you diligently.

805
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,220
Fine.

806
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,940
Sincerity can move even metal and stone.

807
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,620
Since you two are so sincere,

808
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,500
I will personally cook dinner

809
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,580
for you tonight.

810
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,540
Dinner is good.

811
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,620
What about accepting Jing Kan?

812
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,820
- Yes.
- But I can't have

813
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,940
so many final disciples.

814
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,700
I can't embarrass myself.

815
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Is there no room

816
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,460
for negotiation?

817
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,940
That's not entirely true.

818
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,780
Mencius said,

819
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,460
"To educate the gifted"

820
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,020
"is a great joy for a gentleman."

821
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,500
So...

822
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,180
So, I can only bless you.

823
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,940
Give it here.

824
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,860
Let's go, Jing Kan.

825
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,700
If you younger ones

826
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,580
can't handle even a small setback,

827
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,300
how will you do great things?

828
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,900
This is just

829
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,260
a small test for you.

830
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,160
- A test.
- A test.

831
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,740
Sit, sit.

832
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,660
I know, I know.

833
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,780
Unfortunately, you didn't pass.

834
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,540
Forget about being

835
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,860
my disciple.

836
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,860
Let's go.

837
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,740
Don't look back, go.

838
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,860
Wait.

839
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,140
Old man, I'll trust you one last time.

840
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,060
Leave the teapot.

841
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,780
I can help you.

842
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,860
How?

843
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,340
My final disciple

844
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,980
can help you.

845
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,900
Go find him.

846
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,500
Give it to me.

847
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,660
That's true.

848
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,140
His name is Ruan Ling.

849
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,980
Very clever.

850
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,900
Trust me.

851
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,640
Trust him one more time.

852
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,340
At the end of the alley, the black gate.

853
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,340
This should be it.

854
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,860
Who's there?

855
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,460
Coming.

856
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,260
This voice sounds

857
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,580
a bit familiar.

858
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,380
You are...

859
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
Sorry to disturb you...

860
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,860
It's you?

861
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,220
(Ruan Ling, Mr. An's final disciple)

862
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580
What do you mean?

863
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,420
He pretended

864
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,260
to be the Tea Master
and scammed me for money.

865
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,060
Sir,

866
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,760
you must've mistaken me
for someone else.

867
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,180
We've never met.

868
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,260
We've never met?

869
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,680
Wasn't it you who whisked tea

870
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,700
at Yinyu Alley last time?

871
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,140
Yinyu Alley?

872
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,780
I understand.

873
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,180
Seems there's another victim.

874
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,460
I am that victim.

875
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,660
Don't get worked up.

876
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,780
It's a long story.

877
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,100
Come on, go inside and sit.

878
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,720
I'll go buy some food and be right back.

879
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,720
Please.

880
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,020
Come in.

881
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,940
No.

882
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,660
(Free from Desires)
Let go of me.

883
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,580
You...I...

884
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,500
Free from Desires?

885
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,280
Where did you steal it from?

886
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,420
What?

887
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,300
Listen, you're trespassing.

888
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,900
Aren't you the Tea Master?

889
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,260
Where's my money?

890
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,260
What Tea Master?

891
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,160
Listen, if you don't leave,
I'll call for help.

892
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,180
You'll call for help?

893
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,160
No, don't. I won't.

894
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,700
Wait, let me think.

895
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,620
Let me think.

896
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,780
I seem to remember a bit.

897
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,140
I remember.

898
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,380
You want my brother.

899
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,180
We are twins.

900
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
He is the Tea Master.

901
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,300
I am the Tu Master.

902
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,820
You should be looking for him.

903
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,260
No, Tao Baowen is real.

904
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,380
Don't break it.

905
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,700
Return the money you cheated out of him.

906
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,820
See? I already told you.

907
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,860
That was my brother.

908
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,420
You should ask him for it.

909
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,020
Your brother?

910
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,340
I...

911
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,340
I...No, no, it's mine.

912
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,420
Return it to me.

913
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,940
I spent it.

914
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
You spent it?

915
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,220
I didn't mean to.

916
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,300
Jing Kan, report it.

917
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,100
No, no, no.

918
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,120
Listen to me for one sentence.

919
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
Just one.

920
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Actually,

921
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,620
I didn't mean to scam you.

922
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,980
I had my reasons.

923
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,300
Continue your performance.

924
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,220
Go ahead.

925
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,300
My mother is sick.

926
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,500
You think we'd believe you?

927
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,620
Yes.

928
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,340
I know you won't believe me.

929
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,300
I understand your hatred for me.

930
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,100
But before you turn me in,

931
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,100
could you let me

932
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,900
bring fish soup to my mother
one last time?

933
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,700
Fish soup?

934
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,100
It's over there.

935
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,760
Very fresh.

936
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,860
Come on, if you're hungry,

937
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,820
untie me and I'll buy some food for you.

938
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,780
Stop wasting time.

939
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,500
Fine.

940
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,940
I'll continue.

941
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,220
Actually, my mother

942
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,340
is now lying in the clinic.

943
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,620
She doesn't have many days left.

944
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,340
She loves fish soup the most,

945
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,180
and she can only eat

946
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,260
the soup I make.

947
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,000
You're not tricking us again, right?

948
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,220
Who would joke

949
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,140
about their mother?

950
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,620
I'm not lying.

951
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
