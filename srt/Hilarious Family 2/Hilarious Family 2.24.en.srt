25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,280
Sorry, Grandmother.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,280
Sixi's case was urgent.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
Before I could discuss with you,

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,920
I told them how to make

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Banfang Tea.

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,640
After Sixi came back,

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
she apologized in my room.

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,840
Actually, neither of you

33
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,880
should apologize for this.

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,800
You exchanged that

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
for Sixi's innocence.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,440
It's worth it.

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,400
But anyway,

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,320
Zhusi will have to work harder.

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,080
Mother, don't say that.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm the chief manager of Jinyu Tea.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
I should always do my best.

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
Those guys in Laolongtan Tea

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
are quite vicious.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,240
Why did our success slip

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,080
through our fingers to theirs?

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
Yeah, Jing Kan.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,040
You told them how to make

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,880
Banfang Tea.

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Then, will you still
enter the Tea Contest?

50
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
Yes, of course.

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,440
Grandmother,

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,920
after this incident,

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
I realized I had

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
a deeper understanding of tea.

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,480
Now, I have a knack

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
for tea-making.

57
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,640
What did I tell you?

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,520
Don't be so confident.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
You should allow for error.

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
Mother,

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,960
I think it's good for Jing Kan

62
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
to think like that.

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,760
And after this incident,

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,520
I feel quite relieved.

65
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,680
We have a worthy successor now.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,760
Jing Kan, I have faith in you.

67
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,080
You'll work hard.

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,280
I will, of course.

69
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,400
Jing Kan, you can sit.

70
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,480
Zhusi,

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
don't flatter Jing Kan like that.

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,920
He's had some achievements.

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,280
But he's still far

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,640
from cutting the mustard.

75
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
My Lady and Ms. Luo,

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,600
Mr. Wang is here.

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,040
What's he doing here?

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,360
I don't know.

79
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
He said he had something urgent.

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,040
Get him in here.

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,400
All right. Thank you.

82
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,280
My Lady.

83
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,300
Chief Luo.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,140
Ms. Xue.

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
What's up?

86
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
What's the hurry?

87
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,440
I just got the news

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
Laolongtan Tea would open a shop

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,600
beside each of our shops.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,440
Obviously, they'll squeeze us out.

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,000
Is the news reliable?

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
Yes.

93
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,320
I confirmed it

94
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,160
with some landlords.

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,720
They're from Laolongtan Tea.

96
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,720
Oh no.

97
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
What do we do?

98
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
My Lady and Chief Luo,

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
I demand we punish

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,640
the leaker of Banfang Tea.

101
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,360
Now, our tea shops

102
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,200
have a hard time.

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
He...

104
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,640
He's making things worse.

105
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,520
Mr. Wang,

106
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,960
don't panic yet.

107
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
There's always a way out.

108
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,480
I believe

109
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,480
Jing Kan will make

110
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,560
better tea than Banfang Tea.

111
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,680
Seriously?

112
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,790
What's wrong with you?

113
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,630
Chief Luo,

114
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm thinking of you.

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,840
All these years, for Jinyu Tea,

116
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,640
you've been hard-working and anxious.

117
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,920
You've finally come this far.

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
But he ruined it all.

119
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
And he's incompetent.

120
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,800
You're going too far!

121
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,800
Anyway, I'm just trying

122
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,720
to remind everybody

123
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
not to put your hope

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
on this guy.

125
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,520
Shut up.

126
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,650
Chief Luo.

127
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
Take him away.

128
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,800
- Yes.
- I just don't want us

129
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
to be ruined...

130
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm loyal to Jinyu Tea

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,400
from the bottom of my heart.

132
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,240
Leave!

133
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
I'll walk myself.

134
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,320
Let go of me.

135
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,160
He is really arrogant.

136
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,960
Who sent him?

137
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
Is it you, Zhusi?

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
Mother,

139
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,320
my loyalty is true.

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
I'll prove Mr. Wang is wrong.

141
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,190
Why were you

142
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,120
(Jinyu Tea)
impulsive?

143
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,840
Madam's face was flushed with anger.

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,200
I was just worried about Zhusi.

145
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,320
Zhusi?

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,920
Yes.

147
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
Zhusi.

148
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,120
What's wrong?

149
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,480
I can't hold it anymore,

150
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
so what?

151
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,560
I'm worried about her,

152
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
so what?

153
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,240
Are you insane, Wang?

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
Come on, Mr. Wang.

155
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,160
You must remember who you are.

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
I don't want to remember.

157
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,520
Why would I?

158
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,320
Think about it.

159
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,120
Why does Zhusi have to fix

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,200
everybody's mess?

161
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,640
Why has she endured for so many years?

162
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,960
She... She just doesn't get married.

163
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,960
Do you know
how dangerous it is to say this?

164
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
How about this?

165
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,680
I won't tell anyone

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,840
about what you said.

167
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
Hope you won't say it again.

168
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,080
Why can't I say it again?

169
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,760
All these years,

170
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,760
I've been accompanying Zhusi.

171
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Ruicao Tea

172
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,600
offered triple pay

173
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,520
to poach me,

174
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,680
but I refused.

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Why?

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,240
Because I worry about her.

177
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,800
Now, she's desperate.

178
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
But nobody around her

179
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,240
can help her.

180
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,480
That's not true!

181
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,120
I've been helping her.

182
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
How?

183
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,560
How could you even say that?

184
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,940
The spy

185
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,860
you sent to Jing Kan...

186
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,680
Do you know how much he helped Jing Kan?

187
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,700
Without him,

188
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,200
Jing Kan wouldn't
have remade Banfang Tea.

189
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
- What?
- What?

190
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,040
Wang Bufan!

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,720
I won't argue with you.

192
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll pretend

193
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,720
I didn't hear anything today.

194
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,120
Hope you'll extinguish your desire

195
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,520
as soon as possible!

196
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
This is for your own good!

197
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,760
You must be insane!

198
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Zhusi,

199
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,040
it's too hard for you.

200
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Come on. Try our new spring tea.

201
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
All right.

202
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,680
Ruan Ling!

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,680
You liar!

204
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,700
You...

205
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,030
Sorry, but I won't buy any.

206
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,790
Come on. Don't go.

207
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,000
You're alone?

208
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,440
What do you want?

209
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,600
I want you to leave this shop!

210
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Leave this shop?

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Why?

212
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,400
I sent you here as a spy,

213
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,360
but you helped them remake Banfang Tea.

214
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,480
Now, our people

215
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,440
are fearful.

216
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,080
And you ask me why?

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,440
You really overestimated me.

218
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,960
I wasn't me

219
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
who made Banfang Tea.

220
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
You contributed, anyway!

221
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,080
Is that a compliment?

222
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,600
That's a scold.

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,310
You mean I made it easier for them, huh?

224
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,200
Yes, yes. That's right.

225
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
You little brat.

226
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,320
If I hadn't put in a word for you

227
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,160
in front of Madam,

228
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,720
you think you could easily get away

229
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,640
from your fraud

230
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,240
in Baita Bridge Shop?

231
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,240
I warn you.

232
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,840
Within three days,

233
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,160
you must leave this shop.

234
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
Otherwise...

235
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,960
Otherwise what?

236
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
Otherwise,

237
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,800
I will tell your friends

238
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
you're a spy!

239
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,640
Go. Go ahead now.

240
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,640
And you know what?

241
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,040
I'm very confident

242
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,080
of our friendship.

243
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,640
If you tell them, be very specific,

244
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,880
in case I have to add details

245
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
when they ask me.

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,320
All right. Good for you.

247
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm going to tell them now!

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm... I'm so pissed off!

249
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,800
You're really going?

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
Cuiying. Cuiying.

251
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
I was just kidding.

252
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,040
Don't go.

253
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,360
I want to develop a new kind of tea

254
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,680
before the Tea Contest.

255
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Please help me, Master.

256
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,800
I've taught you

257
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,960
all I could.

258
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
As the saying goes, a master teaches

259
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,960
while a disciple practices.

260
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,280
I can't accompany you

261
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,640
all the way to the end.

262
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,680
But this contest matters

263
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
too much to me.

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,600
When you reach a certain stage in life

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,480
and look back,

266
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,200
you will realize

267
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
something isn't

268
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,600
as important as you think it is.

269
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
When I was in the temple,

270
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
I often saw

271
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,360
dying people pray to the gods.

272
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,160
But none of them

273
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,680
felt sorry

274
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,400
for losing a game.

275
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,840
What they regretted

276
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
was having spent little time

277
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
with their families.

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,640
Do you know

279
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,200
the biggest regret

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,080
of Lu Yu, the Sage of Tea?

281
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
No.

282
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
In his life,

283
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,920
his achievements in tea

284
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,560
have reached the peak.

285
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
But he didn't have a family.

286
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,480
He was an orphan.

287
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,400
He didn't get married, either.

288
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,720
He was born alone

289
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
and he died alone.

290
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,160
Everybody only cared

291
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,200
about his achievements.

292
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,920
Nobody cared whether he was tired.

293
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,360
That was pitiful enough.

294
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,120
Tomorrow,

295
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm going back home.

296
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,120
The death anniversary

297
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,320
of my late wife is a few days away.

298
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,440
I want to stay with her.

299
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm saying all this

300
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,640
as my last lesson

301
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,560
for you.

302
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,960
Take care of yourself at home.

303
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
An,

304
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,540
have a nice journey.

305
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,400
What?

306
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,480
It's you who will leave.

307
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Me?

308
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,300
Where am I going?

309
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,760
They've fixed your house.

310
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,840
You'll go back home.

311
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,280
Fixed?

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
But it looks all right.

313
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,040
What the...

314
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,640
Wanqing.

315
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Talk to him.

316
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,560
Master,

317
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,680
your wife's anniversary.

318
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,720
You should go now.

319
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,880
Well, everybody.

320
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
Goodbye, then.

321
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,580
Master.

322
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,680
Come this way.

323
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,880
He really forgot.

324
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,720
See you, Master.

325
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,160
Bye, Master.

326
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,360
Wanqing, settle him down and come back.

327
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,840
Jing Kan.

328
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,960
What did you say to him yesterday?

329
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
Why did he suddenly leave?

330
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
I want to develop a new kind of tea

331
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,560
before the Tea Contest.

332
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,880
New tea?

333
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,760
Do you have enough time?

334
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,680
Yes.

335
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
But our top priority

336
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
is to find a new tea tree.

337
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,080
But anyway, don't worry, Sixi.

338
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,080
I have a strong feeling.

339
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
I will make it.

340
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,720
What do you think, Mr. An?

341
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,280
What gives you this confidence?

342
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
Mr. An, please trust me.

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,280
It's not as hard to make new tea

344
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,960
as we think it is.

345
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,960
As long as we understand

346
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,800
how each step works

347
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,640
on the tea-making,

348
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,520
I believe

349
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,720
you will also

350
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
develop new tea

351
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
just like I did.

352
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,880
Is that so, Mr. An?

353
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,000
Perhaps.

354
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
Jing Kan,

355
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,800
go beg Mr. An to...

356
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,640
No need.

357
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,000
Now,

358
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm no longer what I was.

359
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
Ordinary guys can't understand that.

360
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,600
Why did you just go?

361
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,220
(Jinyu Tea)

362
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,480
Come and taste it.

363
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,120
This is the new tea I've made.

364
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,380
Make some comments.

365
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,240
Be straightforward.

366
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,840
So good?

367
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,760
Let me try some.

368
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,840
You should offer

369
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,760
some practical advice

370
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,000
for my improvement.

371
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,480
Why the act, guys?

372
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
Or what if you didn't taste any?

373
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,160
Kan,

374
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,280
something so bitter I had last time

375
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,170
was the decoction.

376
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,200
Let me taste it.

377
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
It's not bitter.

378
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,400
It's just astringent.

379
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,720
Don't be so exaggerated.

380
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,360
Then, you finish all the rest.

381
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,160
Let's talk business.

382
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,080
Forget about the tea.

383
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,340
Guiwei, go dump it.

384
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,200
Jing Kan,

385
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,440
how about you get back Master Tea-gold?

386
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,760
Seriously,

387
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,840
forget the Tea Contest.

388
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,840
Even if you dump it

389
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,920
and someone picks it up,

390
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,160
boils with honey, osmanthus,

391
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,460
orange peel, and brown sugar,

392
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,300
and even pastries,

393
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,480
he won't swallow it.

394
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
Is this really necessary?

395
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,480
The first step is always hard.

396
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,360
Yes.

397
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
Kan, are you being conceited

398
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,680
after you have made

399
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,240
Banfang Tea?

400
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
Nonsense.

401
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
This failure

402
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,760
didn't surprise me at all.

403
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,920
Do you know why?

404
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,080
The first step is hard.

405
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
Because of An Wanqing.

406
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,760
An Wanqing

407
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
escorted my master away

408
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,640
and hasn't been back.

409
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,800
So, no one controls the firing.

410
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,000
In this case,

411
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,870
the tea leaves

412
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,280
were a little bit...

413
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,360
Well, they were...

414
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,840
Defective.

415
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,360
But it's all right.

416
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,640
When she's back,

417
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,240
I will make some tea leaves

418
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,840
that amaze all of you.

419
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,920
Jing Kan, you're what you used to be

420
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,320
when we first met.

421
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,740
Indeed, right?

422
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,800
Tell them what I did.

423
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,560
You bragged a lot.

424
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,360
You guys just remember.

425
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,000
You'll wait and see.

426
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm just kidding, Jing Kan.

427
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,700
- Kan.
- He's angry.

428
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,560
Go get the umbrella.

429
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,800
Be careful.

430
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,560
Why are you so quiet today?

431
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,520
Are you available?

432
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
Tonight?

433
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,720
Not at all. It's something else.

434
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,560
I told them

435
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,320
I would help them one last time

436
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,600
in the Seven Bowls of Tea case.

437
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
But now, they just won't.

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,930
They just won't.

439
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
They forced me to leave our shop.

440
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,120
So, you told them

441
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,560
about the painting.

442
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,860
I didn't know it was

443
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,160
so important to Jing Kan.

444
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,560
And I really didn't know

445
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,920
Luo Zhusi would destroy it.

446
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,560
But luckily,

447
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,760
they managed to remake Banfang Tea.

448
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,040
Otherwise,

449
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,280
I would

450
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,160
feel guilty.

451
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,800
Then, tell them.

452
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,840
We're friends.

453
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,800
We don't need secrets.

454
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,960
Well, I have faith

455
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,160
in my friends.

456
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
But I don't have faith

457
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,320
in human nature.

458
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,980
Now, they trust me.

459
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,240
But if I tell them the truth,

460
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,600
I'll be a swindler again.

461
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,320
You're a swindler.

462
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,440
You swindled my love.

463
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,560
Not a good time for flirting.

464
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,360
I have true feelings for them.

465
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,280
When I was little, I was poor.

466
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,200
No one looked up at me.

467
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,960
Then, I traveled and deceived people.

468
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
No one around me

469
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
was trustworthy.

470
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,560
So, you can understand

471
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,200
how hard it is for me

472
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,280
to meet

473
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,120
these true friends.

474
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Some advice for you.

475
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,320
Guiwei has always wanted

476
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,440
to be the general manager.

477
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,840
Then, you can provoke him

478
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,640
so that he'll complain to Jing Kan.

479
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,680
This time, you should play along

480
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,520
and accept it.

481
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,440
Then, when you leave,

482
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,520
nobody will suspect you.

483
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,040
You know what?

484
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,080
It's a really good idea.

485
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,560
Think about Guiwei.

486
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
I can easily provoke him.

487
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Shuangxi, I didn't know

488
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,440
you were really wise.

489
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,720
No wonder we're friends.

490
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,240
Friends?

491
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,280
Yes.

492
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,200
Wait.

493
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,600
Make this clear.

494
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
It's perfect timing.

495
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,160
Tell me.

496
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,160
What on earth is

497
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,280
our relationship?

498
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,000
Friends, like I said.

499
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,760
What do you mean friends?

500
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,120
Don't pretend to be drunk,

501
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,960
will you?

502
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,240
I think

503
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,280
I can go have a drink.

504
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,200
Stop right there.

505
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,920
Only one question.

506
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,040
Are we

507
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,480
just friends?

508
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,520
When did I say

509
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
we were friends?

510
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
I said, intimate friends.

511
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,080
Intimate friends.

512
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,200
You...

513
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,880
Good, Wei Shuangxi.

514
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,080
Don't try to muddle through.

515
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,200
That's what you usually do.

516
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,640
Wait until I'm done with this.

517
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,520
Guiwei.

518
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
Ruan.

519
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,800
Working, huh?

520
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,320
Go on with it.

521
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,200
What are you doing?

522
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,880
Go.

523
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,080
Go wipe the shelf.

524
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,360
All right.

525
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,040
Can't you see the floor is dirty?

526
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Sweep it.

527
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,200
All right.

528
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,760
Are you expecting me

529
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
to wash the teacups?

530
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,520
But I was just...

531
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,960
All right, then.

532
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,760
Why are you wandering around?

533
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,760
Why?

534
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,040
Can't you wipe the shelf,

535
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,560
sweep the floor, and wash the teacups?

536
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,600
How?

537
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
Talking back, huh?

538
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,920
Are you?

539
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,480
You know what?

540
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm the general manager.

541
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,160
You should do

542
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,160
what I tell you to.

543
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Understand?

544
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,040
I'll do it.

545
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,800
Wait, wait.

546
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,580
Are you being defiant?

547
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,480
Tell me. Are you being defiant?

548
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
I'm not.

549
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
You can be defiant.

550
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,360
But I'm not.

551
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,360
Yes, you can.

552
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,320
If you think it's unfair,

553
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,240
complain to Kan.

554
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
Ask him to make you the general manager.

555
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,120
No, no, no.

556
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,480
Why?

557
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Ruan,

558
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,920
I used to be shallow.

559
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
But as I got along with you,

560
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,800
I realized

561
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,600
I was inferior.

562
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,000
And Kan is right.

563
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,920
You're indeed good at doing business.

564
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,560
I don't understand.

565
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,480
But Ruan, I admire you.

566
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,520
What?

567
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
This isn't right.

568
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
How could you be like this?

569
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,300
Sorry. Sorry, Ruan.

570
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
I won't do this anymore.

571
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,040
I used to be jealous of you.

572
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Because I didn't admit

573
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,960
you could do better

574
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,800
than me.

575
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,600
But I thought it through.

576
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,120
I can't make progress

577
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,760
unless I see others' excellence.

578
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,120
So, Ruan...

579
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,200
I...

580
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,440
I admire you.

581
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,760
What an unambitious man.

582
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,560
Ruan,

583
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,680
if someone I don't admire

584
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,000
complains about me,

585
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
I'll talk back hard.

586
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,320
But if I admire him,

587
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
I'll accept whatever he says.

588
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,220
Fine.

589
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Whatever you say.

590
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,000
You're getting the wrong model!

591
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,160
Wait.

592
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,860
Are you regretting it?

593
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,960
Are you?

594
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,000
I have a question.

595
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,000
Can I only wipe the shelf

596
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,240
when sweeping the floor?

597
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,240
If I have to wash the teacups,

598
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,720
I can't do them

599
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
at one time.

600
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
How silly!

601
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,440
I'm still not doing well enough.

602
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,680
Ruan.

603
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,320
Let me try.

604
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
Wash the teacups.

605
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,440
I can do it.

606
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,200
A bit more fire.

607
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,160
Le... Less.

608
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,160
A little bit less.

609
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,200
I made it.

610
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,720
How does it taste?

611
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,840
Good.

612
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Just ordinary tea.

613
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,720
It's still far

614
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,920
from being distinguished

615
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
or extraordinary.

616
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,200
You're better at idioms than fire.

617
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm making a comment.

618
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
What do you think is the problem?

619
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,600
Since I remade Banfang Tea,

620
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,440
I've realized

621
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
the pan-firing of tea

622
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
should be simple.

623
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,200
And tea-making techniques

624
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,840
will be simpler and simpler.

625
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,720
So, I simplified some steps

626
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,840
accordingly.

627
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,080
Which step?

628
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,200
Picking.

629
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,680
So, the stems remained.

630
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Your master said,

631
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,760
tea will taste clear without the stems.

632
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,280
It's the key to Songluo Tea.

633
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,130
But now, we are

634
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,480
developing something new.

635
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,520
So... So I want

636
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,360
to surprise people.

637
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,520
You made it.

638
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,600
You surprised me.

639
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,150
Is it that you can't

640
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,160
make anything new alone?

641
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,560
Impossible. I'm telling you.

642
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,360
Now, I'm just making some kinds of tea

643
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,250
very casually

644
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,120
to find the right way.

645
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,760
You better be.

646
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,760
From tomorrow on,

647
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,330
I will seriously develop

648
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,120
some excellent, extraordinary,

649
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,080
and astonishing tea

650
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,440
for you. Applaud if you understand.

651
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,000
I should go.

652
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,320
Oh no.

653
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,640
The Tea Contest, seriously?

654
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,900
(Tea: From Beginner to Master)

655
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
What are you doing?

656
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,080
Nothing. Just having a rest.

657
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,800
I thought you were reading a tea book.

658
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,760
I knew I was wrong.

659
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,360
You must know every word of the book.

660
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,640
Of course.

661
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,470
Today, in the street,

662
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,320
I met some managers

663
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,080
from other shops of Jinyu Tea.

664
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,970
They told me

665
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,700
they weren't really unsure

666
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,880
if Laolongtan Tea would crush us.

667
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,720
I said, "Impossible.

668
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,280
As long as Jing Kan is there,

669
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,000
Laolongtan Tea will never crush us."

670
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,600
I also told them

671
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,240
we would soon develop

672
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
a new kind of tea leaves

673
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
better than Luhuaxian.

674
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,840
Not... Not that soon.

675
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,760
No problem. Good luck.

676
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,360
Do you think

677
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,520
I often talk very confidently?

678
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
What happened?

679
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,640
I've heard that great people

680
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,000
usually keep things to themselves.

681
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,320
But I just slipped it out.

682
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Do you think it will hinder me

683
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,280
from doing something great?

684
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,960
Not at all.

685
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
One succeeds based on his strength.

686
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,700
You have strength.

687
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,760
Don't worry about that.

688
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Then, think about it.

689
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,200
Many people

690
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
hate it too much

691
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
because they don't want us

692
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,160
to succeed in this,

693
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,520
and will it stop me

694
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
from succeeding?

695
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,920
Have you stayed up too late

696
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,800
and had less energy?

697
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,760
Why can these messy things

698
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,680
disturb you?

699
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,240
How about this?

700
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
Tomorrow, I'll go to the temple

701
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,480
and get a rite for you.

702
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
Then, all these resentments on you

703
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,040
will be removed.

704
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
You just focus.

705
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,200
Think about it.

706
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Is it possible...?

707
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,920
Are you in trouble?

708
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,800
Who? Me?

709
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,320
Me?

710
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,200
Impossible.

711
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,200
Fine. I like it

712
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,480
when you sound so confident.

713
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
But you must remember.

714
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,440
Since you give people hope,

715
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,920
you must be responsible.

716
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,360
Keep it up.

717
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,760
Morning, Wang.

718
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,680
Come often.

719
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,520
Ruan, arranging flowers?

720
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,640
What's wrong?

721
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,080
Take your seat.

722
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Here's the thing.

723
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,360
You know Ruicao Tea, right?

724
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,280
A shop of Ruicao Tea

725
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,160
wanted to poach me.

726
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,800
They'll give me ten taels a month.

727
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,800
And I can see

728
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
they have kind attitudes.

729
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,720
And in this shop,

730
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,560
you can't offer me that much.

731
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
So, I'm thinking...

732
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,440
They can give you ten taels?

733
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,240
Fine.

734
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
I'll give you twelve.

735
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,560
I mean, ten taels at least.

736
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,600
And I don't think

737
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,960
you need

738
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,040
to keep up appearances.

739
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,880
How much do you want?

740
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,000
I think I deserve at least

741
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
fifteen taels.

742
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
Fifteen?

743
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,040
Fifteen.

744
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,080
In this case...

745
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,520
Good for you, Ruan Ling.

746
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,480
Fine, if you stay here.

747
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,120
I believe Jing Kan will also agree.

748
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,680
Have you understood what I said?

749
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,240
Fifteen taels for a month.

750
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,290
Do you know how much

751
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,600
you can profit every month?

752
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,400
And think about this.

753
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Look. Look all around.

754
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,560
The tea leaves...

755
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,960
They don't sell at all.

756
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,560
And Jing Kan can't develop new tea.

757
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,920
Don't you think staying here

758
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,440
will be a waste of time for me?

759
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,800
Indeed.

760
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,800
Have a vacation.

761
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,120
A paid vacation, all right?

762
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,000
Also, someone here and I

763
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
can't get along.

764
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,360
I've had enough of it.

765
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,480
Guiwei, come over!

766
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,160
You...

767
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,400
Did you mess with the general manager?

768
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,520
Sixi,

769
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,040
I've been behaving poorly.

770
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,600
I swept the floor and wiped the shelf.

771
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,880
I thought I couldn't wash the teacups.

772
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,800
I doubted Ruan.

773
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,000
But later, I realized...

774
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Actually,

775
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,320
I could do that.

776
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,840
How did you do that?

777
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,240
Then, did you apologize to him?

778
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
You...

779
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,560
Ruan,

780
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,440
I'm sorry.

781
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,600
I underestimated myself.

782
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,440
Thank you for improving me.

783
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,560
Without you,

784
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
I wouldn't be like this.

785
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,600
No, no. This is not what I mean.

786
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,440
Get up.

787
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,360
All right, Guiwei.

788
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,680
Go back and reflect.

789
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,240
To be honest with you,

790
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,440
I just want to quit.

791
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
Why?

792
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,280
No reason.

793
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
I'm fed up.

794
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
- Bored.
- Ruan Ling.

795
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,680
Wait.

796
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,840
Ruan Ling, I know.

797
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,320
We had many misunderstandings.

798
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,480
But recently, I've realized

799
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,360
you take us as your friends.

800
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,200
I've prepared the money.

801
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
It's your reward.

802
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,840
You can go anywhere

803
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,720
you're interested in.

804
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,720
But when you're tired of traveling,

805
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,480
if you want to come back,

806
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,880
you'll always be welcome here.

807
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,680
Come on, what are you doing?

808
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Why can't I leave without guilt?

809
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,680
I know.

810
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,440
You've been really stressed recently.

811
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,400
You'll have some good rest.

812
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,640
Ruan Ling,

813
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,040
Jing Kan paid back the money

814
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,640
to the fruit farmers for you.

815
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,520
If you really want to leave,

816
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,440
I think you should

817
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,680
tell your good friend

818
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,520
in his face.

819
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,360
My heart hurts.

820
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,280
It hurts in bursts.

821
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,240
Jing Kan.

822
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,880
Ruan Ling.

823
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,220
There you are.

824
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,080
Umm...

825
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,920
What do I do?

826
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,400
What do you mean?

827
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,520
I realized I couldn't make it.

828
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,600
I underestimated
the difficulty of new tea.

829
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,000
I remade Banfang Tea

830
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,840
because I tasted it.

831
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,520
I knew its color, smell, and taste.

832
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,720
So, I knew what to do.

833
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,520
But now, I have to develop

834
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,240
a totally new kind of tea.

835
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
I don't know what to do.

836
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
But I bragged.

837
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,240
I can't be too complacent.

838
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,320
Otherwise, life would slap me.

839
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
This is all that I can tell you.

840
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,560
You must not

841
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,600
tell anyone else about it.

842
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,120
Try to help me out.

843
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,440
Well,

844
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,960
you don't panic now.

845
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,360
There's always a way out.

846
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,640
Don't be ridiculous.

847
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,120
I'm totally desperate now.

848
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Come on, think of what I can do.

849
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,280
Do you think

850
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,360
it will be helpful

851
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
if I leave the shop now?

852
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,880
You'll help me here?

853
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,040
Then, no.

854
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,240
The shop needs you.

855
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,840
You... You go back.

856
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,960
Kan,

857
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,120
I know it's inappropriate

858
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
to say something this.

859
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,920
- But...
- But if I failed

860
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,760
in the end,

861
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
don't laugh at me.

862
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,600
Don't worry.

863
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,000
I won't be in the mood

864
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,160
at that time.

865
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,040
Thank you

866
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
for caring about my feelings.

867
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,480
Go back to the tea.

868
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I'll go back to work.

869
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Ruan Ling.

870
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,560
When you're back,

871
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,960
tell them I'm not going back.

872
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,760
If I go back there,

873
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,600
I can't face them.

874
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,400
All right.

875
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,840
Ruan Ling.

876
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,400
Umm...

877
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,400
Come and see me.

878
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,480
I will.

879
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,480
Now, Jing Kan

880
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,720
needs me.

881
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,960
I don't know how to tell him about that.

882
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,240
And Guiwei...

883
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,280
He's suddenly being nice to me.

884
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,000
He respects me a lot.

885
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,960
Whatever I ask him to do,

886
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,320
he just does it.

887
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,560
And Sixi...

888
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,680
She agreed to raise my pay.

889
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,320
However much I asked for,

890
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,680
she approved.

891
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,960
She even asked me to get good rest.

892
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,340
Seriously,

893
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,840
if they treated me worse,

894
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,120
even just a little bit worse,

895
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I would leave without guilt.

896
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,320
But now,

897
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,720
they treat me so nicely.

898
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,120
Oh my god.

899
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,880
Can't you punish me

900
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,160
in some other way?

901
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,440
Then, you just stay.

902
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,760
Under such circumstances,

903
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,120
do you think I can stay?

904
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,960
I...

905
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,040
I betrayed them.

906
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,280
Fine.

907
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,000
Even if I can

908
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
leave right away,

909
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,840
I just can't stand it.

910
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,360
I can't stand it

911
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,120
when they look at me

912
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,440
that way.

913
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,800
After you leave,

914
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
you won't be able to see them.

915
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
What if I dream of them?

916
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,520
How do they look at you?

917
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,720
As if they knew

918
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,600
their friend betrayed them.

919
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,080
Why can you never empathize?

920
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,560
And if one day,

921
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,160
I meet them, how can I face them?

922
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,120
How can I?

923
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,720
Let me be honest.

924
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,000
You don't need to go.

925
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,520
Why?

926
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,680
They have long known

927
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,640
you were a spy.

928
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,720
No way. When did they know that?

929
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,640
I told them.

930
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,360
When did you?

931
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,200
Shortly after you told me.

932
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,360
So,

933
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800
when I embarrassed Guiwei

934
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,840
and asked Sixi for more money,

935
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,360
they knew everything.

936
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,240
But they still tolerated me.

937
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,000
Don't be sad. Stop thinking.

938
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,760
Just stay.

939
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

940
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,600
You're making me

941
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,720
quite embarrassed.

942
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,760
They stopped me.

943
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,760
They said we should let go of the past

944
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,200
and never bring it up again.

945
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,240
I didn't know.

946
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,920
I really didn't know.

947
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,030
- Why?
- I swear to you.

948
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,280
I pledge my life

949
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
that I'll repay them!

950
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,720
Sixi, Guiwei,

951
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,040
wait for me.

952
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,480
Sixi.

953
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,640
Do you think Kan will make the new tea?

954
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,920
Get ready for the failure.

955
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,400
Don't bother him these days.

956
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,600
Why?

957
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
Don't you know him?

958
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,280
He's too proud.

959
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,120
Actually, I've realized

960
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,040
he can't even sleep

961
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,280
because he can't make new tea.

962
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,680
He's still pretending

963
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,640
in case I know it.

964
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,680
He is...

965
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,280
He's just too proud.

966
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,640
You're both here.

967
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,760
Ruan.

968
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,760
What's this?

969
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,920
The latest pastry from Careful Pastry.

970
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,360
The costliest Zhenzhu Cake.

971
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,640
I didn't put it on account.

972
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I paid for it.

973
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,520
Come on.

974
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,960
Why did you buy such costly cake?

975
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,800
Donglin often brings back some.

976
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,040
That's his business.

977
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
And this is mine.

978
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,600
It's my present for you.

979
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
Enjoy the cake. I'll go make tea.

980
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,440
Ruan.

981
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,080
What are you doing?

982
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,080
A general manager

983
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,960
shouldn't do this.

984
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,800
- I'll do it.
- No.

985
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,400
So what?

986
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,680
Can't I do something

987
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,520
just for you?

988
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,760
Guiwei, you just enjoy the food.

989
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,720
Me? I'm too embarrassed to eat.

990
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,020
- No. Don't yell.
- Today, I...

991
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,920
- I can't eat.
- No.

992
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,000
- Stubborn man.
- I'll do it.

993
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,120
Ruan Ling. Ruan Ling.

994
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Before my mother left,

995
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,160
he bought shoes for Guiwei

996
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,040
and Jing Kan.

997
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,880
Jing Kan said you lost one shoe.

998
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,280
So, he gave his to you.

999
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,440
I did such bad things to you.

1000
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,640
But you're still so nice to me.

1001
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,680
What did you do to us?

1002
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,840
Never mind.

1003
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,080
Fine. You call the shots.

1004
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,400
I'll stop.

1005
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,520
Let bygones be bygones.

1006
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,760
From this day on,

1007
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,880
if I can't make our shop

1008
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,000
the best shop in town,

1009
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,640
I'll slap myself in the face.

1010
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,280
Sixi, you got it wrong.

1011
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,960
These are not Kan's shoes.

1012
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,490
Kan's feet

1013
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,680
aren't as big as Ruan's.

1014
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,920
But Ruan's feet

1015
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,080
are as big as mine.

1016
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,520
So, I gave you

1017
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,480
this pair of shoes.

1018
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,360
Guiwei,

1019
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,800
you secretly tried on my shoes?

1020
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,560
It's no big deal.

1021
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,200
And I secretly told Kan

1022
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,720
you lost a shoe.

1023
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,920
Guiwei.

1024
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,280
What have I done?

1025
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm so terrible.

1026
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,440
All right, Ruan Ling.

1027
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
Glad you've corrected your mistakes.

1028
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,480
Don't blame yourself.

1029
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
That's not the case.

1030
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,560
No.

1031
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,280
Actually,

1032
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,680
I'm grateful to Luo Zhusi.

1033
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,760
She asked me to spy on you.

1034
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Otherwise, we wouldn't

1035
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,240
have been so close.

1036
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,000
I can convince myself
to forget about this.

1037
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,040
But the painting in this shop...

1038
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,880
If I hadn't tipped her off,

1039
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,520
you would have remade Banfang Tea.

1040
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,880
You can even forgive me for that.

1041
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,360
How did you actually do it?

1042
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,920
But I believe,

1043
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,080
in the near future,

1044
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,960
we will be

1045
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,360
better versions of ourselves.

1046
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,720
Let's hug each other

1047
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,760
for that day,

1048
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,600
my friends.

1049
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,620
(Jinyu Tea Plantation)

1050
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,080
Wait, wait.

1051
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,240
You knew it, didn't you?

1052
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,400
Get lost!

1053
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,120
When...

1054
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,600
When was it packed?

1055
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,880
I...

1056
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,600
Wei Shuangxi.

1057
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,480
Wei Shuangxi! You...
