DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,100
EPISODE 1

3
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,355
It's not a crime to fall in love.

4
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:05,899
Damn, that's hot!

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,110
I never wanted to take it this far.

6
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,362
But it was like fate.

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,698
-That's all.
-"Fate"?

8
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,658
What the hell are we then?

9
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,495
-There's an expiration date to love.
-What a load of bullshit.

10
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,954
What a load of bullshit.

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,289
THREE PETALS

12
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,582
I want a divorce.

13
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,710
DIVORCE AND ALIMONY COUNTERCLAIMS

14
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,379
-What a bastard.
-You bastard.

15
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,215
-What the…
-Su-jeong.

16
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,758
-Where are you going?
-Su-jeong!

17
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,301
Where are you going?

18
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,637
You have to sue his mistress!

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,014
What…

20
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,266
Is it over?

21
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,519
Come on.

22
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,066
As you can see
in the footage we submitted,

23
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,279
while Mr. Kim Jeong-nam
was grabbing the plaintiff by her arm,

24
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,157
Ms. Lee Chun-ja was
running away with the phone.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,409
What could have been on that phone

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,078
that she ran away with it so desperately?

27
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,247
Circumstantial evidence isn't proof.

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,790
Let's move on then.

29
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:50,378
The two were sitting
close together in that dark bar,

30
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,423
touching each other's hands
and caressing each other's faces…

31
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,342
and this is according to
the bar owner's statement.

32
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,886
What were you,

33
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,846
a married man, doing there?

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,808
It seems like Ms. Park Eun-ok
doesn't know her husband very well.

35
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,729
Are you aware that my client
has been studying numerology?

36
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,314
Numerology, my ass.

37
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,650
Numerology?
The thing that fortune tellers practice?

38
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,361
-Is that what you're talking about?
-Correct.

39
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,699
But don't people normally have a book open
and jot things down when they do that?

40
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,493
So why was he holding her hand,
caressing her face,

41
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,495
-and getting his hand under--
-He was reading her palm.

42
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,247
And her face too.

43
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,501
The texture of the skin plays a big part
in analyzing one's physiognomy.

44
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,670
-What did you say?
-It's okay.

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,716
You've already become
a physiognomy expert yourself.

46
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,346
I personally believe
that circumstantial evidence can be valid.

47
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,473
But since they're being absurd,

48
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,017
we'll hand this case over to the court

49
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,563
and I'll submit this phone as evidence

50
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,065
after digital forensic analysis.

51
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,568
Decisive evidence will
save both sides so much trouble.

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,112
And we'll be demanding compensation

53
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,823
for psychological damage
as well as for defamation,

54
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,618
for writing all of this off
as pathological jealousy.

55
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,746
How do you plan on proceeding, counselor?

56
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,920
MEDIATOR

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,382
We'll accept the plaintiff's terms.

58
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,717
Attorney Shin!

59
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,554
Thank you so much!

60
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,640
-Sure.
-I'm so grateful!

61
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,808
Please calm down.

62
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,770
All right.

63
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,064
Thank you so much.

64
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,815
RECENT CALLS

65
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,941
HYEON-U

66
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,537
The number cannot be reached.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

67
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,832
You will be charged after the beep.

68
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,805
Hold up!

69
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,697
That's her, right?

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,491
Be quiet.

71
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,949
I'm stomped on like dirt at times

72
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,867
All right

73
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,204
I survived another day

74
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,333
This is me

75
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,044
This is me

76
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,672
No matter how much I shout

77
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,384
In the dark alleyway

78
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,386
The wet shadow--

79
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,804
Hel…

80
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,681
-Hello?
-How did it go?

81
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,184
How do you think?
Obviously, it went great.

82
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,937
Also, Mr. Jang.

83
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,982
Did you bug my car or something?

84
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,484
What is it? Did I spoil your fun again?

85
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,402
Yes.

86
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,279
Why do you always do that?

87
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,864
Do you have something against me?

88
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,866
We'll talk once I get back.

89

90
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,052
I'm back.

91
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,972
Congratulations on winning your case.

92
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,183
You didn't have to do this, Sae-bom.

93
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,893
Thank you.

94
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,644
Great job.

95
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,357
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

96
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,484
Damn it.

97
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,835
You want to be kicked, don't you?

98
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,754
When will you get that fixed?

99
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,590
Apparently, they can't even fix it.

100
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,134
-We have to replace it.
-Replace it?

101
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,095
A new door would look out of place.

102
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,808
So how did it go?

103
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,810
Is it completely over?

104
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,270
Do you even have to ask?

105
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,232
My client reached a settlement
thanks to her excellent attorney.

106
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,610
Considering how old you were
when you barely passed the bar exam,

107
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,613
I'm not sure if I'd call you competent.

108
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,201
Would you mind sitting down for a second?

109
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,912
Come on, have a seat.

110
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,581
Listen.

111
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:05,336
You just don't seem to understand this

112
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,213
no matter how many times I explain it.

113
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,716
Let me explain it one last time.

114
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,343
All right.

115
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,098
I began studying at an age
where my brain cells

116
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,183
weren't all that active.

117
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,562
I passed the exam triumphantly

118
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:27,608
after two years of grueling effort.

119
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,860
What's it called?

120
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,446
Believe That or Not?

121
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,910
My achievement is astonishing enough
to be on that show.

122
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,246
And you already know that,

123
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,373
yet you keep uttering such absurd things.

124
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,084
How do you think that makes me feel?

125
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,502
I'll state the facts.

126
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,338
On average, it takes four years
to pass the bar exam.

127
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,881
Exactly.

128
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,341
Passing the exam in two years?

129
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,219
That's commendable.

130
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,763
And after all that hard work,

131
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,725
you should be taking on
a broader range of cases.

132
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,892
Right?

133
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,312
This and that. Right?

134
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,023
Other types of cases
besides divorce, right?

135
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,149
What?

136
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,360
You know the saying,
"Happiness begins at home," right?

137
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,989
I know there are different kinds
of lawsuits in this world, okay?

138
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,159
But I personally think
those are the most important ones.

139
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,702
Divorce suits.

140
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,955
It's not like you've ever been married.

141
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,791
Hold on. What's with you today?

142
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,879
I'm under the weather,
so don't provoke me.

143
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,341
Hey, you're the one who provoked me. Okay?

144
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,469
You feeling like crap doesn't give you
the right to give me crap.

145
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,137
I'm living the life.

146
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,473
What is it?

147
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,141
Why are you so depressed this time?

148
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,225
I'm sad.

149
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,685
-About what?
-Lee Seo-jin.

150
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,105
-My favorite DJ left her radio show.
-Lee Seo-jin?

151
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,941
I listen to her show every morning
while you watch your drama.

152
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,942
Pay attention, will you?

153
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,527
Goodness.

154
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,946
That's so heartbreaking.

155
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,115
It really is. Go.

156
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,410
Get back to work, will you?

157
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:07,500
I hope she doesn't
make a bad decision out of despair.

158
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,211
She should just move to another country.

159
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,421
It's the one who leaked the video
who should be locked up.

160
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,589
Why should the victim hide?

161
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,799
And you should--

162
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,051
You have a client, sir.

163
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,094
Okay.

164
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,979
I must be so sad that I'm seeing things.

165
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,565
She looks a lot like Lee Seo-jin.

166
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,116
Hello.

167
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,575
Holy crap, it's Lee Seo-jin!

168
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,411
Ms. Lee.

169
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,873
Are you looking me up?

170
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,667
Just checking the weather.

171
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,877
It really is me.

172
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,672
-Where should I sit?
-Over…

173
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,425
Over there, please.

174
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,656
Sae-bom, have I told you
that I'm a huge fan of Lee Seo-jin's?

175
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,615
Yes.

176
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,616
I see.

177
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,454
It would be inappropriate for me
to ask her for an autograph, right?

178
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,538
Yes.

179
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,709
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

180
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,186
I'd like to speak
with Attorney Shin in private.

181
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,704
Sorry about that.

182
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,500
Let's see.

183
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,213
I guess I should be sitting here.

184
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,263
I heard you specialize in divorce cases.

185
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,516
Yes, that's correct.

186
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,852
My husband wants a divorce.

187
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,522
So we're going to get one.

188
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,941
I want it to go well.

189
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,400
The divorce.

190
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,695
I see.

191
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,990
You must be surprised by my attitude.

192
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,158
Yes.

193
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,451
I mean, no.

194
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,119
In my shoes,

195
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,373
people would usually
want to die out of shame.

196
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,376
Does it make you uncomfortable

197
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,545
that I'm keeping my head up?

198
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,881
Do you feel like

199
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,926
you want to die right now?

200
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,723
I do.

201
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,772
Please help me.

202
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,407
I'm afraid

203
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,161
that I don't think I could help you.

204
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,373
Is it because it'll be hard to win?

205
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,918
That's correct.

206
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,546
I may not know everything,

207
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,174
but I'm roughly aware
of your current situation.

208
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,053
I'm sure everyone is.

209
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:48,971
Which is why

210
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,099
I don't think you're in an ideal situation

211
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,519
for a good divorce.

212
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,313
I see.

213
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,531
Attorney Shin.

214
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,657
Yes?

215
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,535
What's your definition?

216
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,039
Of a good divorce.

217
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,587
I guess it's when a client

218
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,131
gets what they want.

219
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,258
Then why aren't you asking me

220
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,636
what I want?

221
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,515
I'm sorry.

222
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,063
What exactly is your goal?

223
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,318
Division of property, for instance…

224
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,486
I don't need that.

225
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,364
I don't need anything.

226
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,993
The only thing I want is…

227
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,538
the custody of my child.

228
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,511
Although it's not looking great for me.

229
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,406
An affair,

230
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,994
a leaked sex tape…

231
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,832
Motherly love in the worst situation.

232
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,212
Please excuse me.

233
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,922
Do you mean it?

234
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,217
Do you?

235
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,596
Do you really want

236
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,599
custody of your child?

237
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,811
Yes.

238
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,442
It's bound to get really messy.

239
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,401
So?

240
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,030
Your life could get
even more miserable than it is now.

241
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,032
-What are you trying to say?
-You might even

242
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,409
lose the suit.

243
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,290
Despite all that,
do you still think it's worth trying?

244
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,542
Despite all of that,

245
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,628
I still want custody of my child.

246
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,381
And I won't give up.

247
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,967
Does that answer your question?

248
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,470
Yes.

249
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,680
Absolutely.

250
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,491
Should we shake hands or high-five?

251
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,994
We should shake on it, right?

252
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,704
We can high-five

253
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,626
once you get your custody.

254
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:37,866
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

255
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,002
Look. Here she comes.

256
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,172
-If I were her--
-Isn't she so brazen?

257
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,423
I'm shocked.

258
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,426
-Unbelievable.
-Right?

259
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,738
THE WORLD THROUGH THE PEOPLE'S EYES
LET'S LULULALA

260
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,211
Seo-jin!

261
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,508
I just stopped by to see you.

262
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,595
I would have come to you
if you gave me a call.

263
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,929
Maybe I should have.

264
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,099
Everyone was trying to sneak a peek at me.

265
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,059
That's because you're so gorgeous.

266
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,312
Their imaginations are running wild.

267
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,855
Come on.

268
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,066
I'm sorry for leaving like this

269
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,111
after working together for four years.

270
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,406
I also

271
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,742
quit the show.

272
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,369
Why would you do that?

273
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,206
I want to go on a trip.
To Chiang Mai or somewhere.

274
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:12,211
Neither of us has
taken a break in four years.

275
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,421
If you feel bad for introducing him to me,

276
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,923
there's no need to.

277
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,758
I brought it upon myself.

278
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,010
That's not why.

279
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,805
I haven't been feeling so well lately.
I want to rest.

280
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,753
How's the attorney?

281
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,964
Does he seem competent?

282
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,881
I'm not sure yet.

283
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,175
But he seems trustworthy.

284
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,405
Turn it off.

285
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,406
It'll ruin your eyesight.

286
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,449
Turn it off.

287
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:17,961
Have some.

288
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,213
You didn't eat much for dinner.

289
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,840
Get out.

290
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,701
-Why are you here?
-I'll stay in the guest room.

291
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,660
Don't worry.

292
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,038
Go to a hotel.
Don't make me repeat myself.

293
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,124
Hyeon-u is here.

294
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,460
I need to be with him.

295
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,838
I heard you were looking for an attorney.
Did you get some advice?

296
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,548
What is it?

297
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,885
Were you told to be with your son
if you wanted to win custody?

298
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,849
-Leave while I'm still being nice.
-Let me go!

299
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,105
I'm going to expose
your true face to the world.

300
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,023
As if anyone would believe you.

301
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,316
Do you still not get it?

302
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,987
You even got kicked off of a show
you've been hosting for four years.

303
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,074
Just snap out of it and find your way out.

304
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,910
I'm not leaving this place
without Hyeon-u.

305
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,995
Do you think I'm crazy?

306
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,789
I'd never hand him over
to a slut like you.

307
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,125
Watch what you say. Hyeon-u will hear you.

308
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,837
You're such a caring mother for someone
who had an affair and even filmed a…

309
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,922
Forget it.

310
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,216
Get out of here already!

311
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,969
Can we please keep it quiet?

312
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,143
You've completely lost your mind,
haven't you?

313
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,228
How dare you talk back to me?

314
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,692
If I hadn't lost my mind,
I would've left you a long time ago.

315
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,903
You're below human.

316
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,826
Hey.

317
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,996
That's rich coming from you
after what you've done.

318
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,417
How dare you crawl back here?
Do you want to die?

319
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,246
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

320
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,332
How far behind are you on rent?

321
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,626
Don't you watch the news?

322
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,129
You should see
the real estate prices these days.

323
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,883
Plus, why are you
giving me crap about that?

324
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,259
You're not the landlord.

325
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,345
He won't be as nice to you
as I am right now.

326
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,597
Just let me be the messenger.

327
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,057
He doesn't scare me.

328
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,270
He's here. Just my luck.

329
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,149
-Goodness.
-Yo.

330
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,235
Hey, my dear Sung-han.

331
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,736
Hey, I'm not "your" Sung-han.

332
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,820
Okay.

333
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,448
Well… Hey,

334
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,116
do you want some coffee?

335
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,618
You bought coffee?

336
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,455
-How much did that 100-pack cost?
-Not a lot. It was on sale.

337
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,123
-Hey.
-Yes?

338
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,626
-Is that a new Rolex?
-No, it's a knockoff.

339
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,836
What about that car?

340
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,048
Was the plate number 09G 2398?

341
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,007
Did you get a new car?

342
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,094
Come on.

343
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,430
I don't have the money for that, man.

344
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:03,561
If I had the money to buy a car,
I would've paid rent.

345
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,564
How do you think I feel
to be behind on rent

346
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,774
in a friend's building?

347
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,402
-You're unbelievable.
-Why are you yelling?

348
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,987
Hey!

349
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,740
Who parks their car
in front of someone's workplace?

350
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,706
How did you get a new car

351
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,125
when you can't even pay rent?

352
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,293
Stay out of it, dude.

353
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,630
This is…

354
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,382
Sung-han, I can explain.

355
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,758
Please. I'm all ears.

356
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,969
-Well…
-Yes?

357
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,306
You know my family wasn't exactly
well-off when I was growing up.

358
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,223
Right.

359
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,143
-My mom would--
-This is getting boring.

360
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,936
Should we eat something? I'm hungry.

361
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,271
We can eat while we listen.

362
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,522
Sounds good.

363
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,400
-Let's do that.
-I'm famished.

364
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,862
It's a sports car.

365
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,447
-Really?
-Really?

366
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,324
-Look at the seats.
-What?

367
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,700
They're red.

368
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,243
-Look at this.
-I mean, that's…

369
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,162
-That's a sports car.
-It is.

370
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,833
-Unbelievable.
-I know.

371
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,963
CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

372
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,424
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

373
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,509
This is Jo Jeong-sik
from Jo Jeong-sik Real Estate,

374
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,844
the best real estate office.

375
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,138
Right now?

376
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,724
Is it now or never?

377
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,142
Sure.

378
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,394
Don't hang up. I'm on my way.

379
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,188
-Yes, I'll be there soon.
-I think he's acting.

380
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,189
He's full of shit.

381
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,983
Do you think the old lady got really sick?

382
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,318
Don't you have her number?

383
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,028
I have the restaurant's.

384
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,864
-The one that's on here?
-Yes.

385
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,492
This one? You think I don't see that?

386
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,743
Let's go to a convenience store.

387
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,995
I need to hurry.
I'm meeting with Ms. Lee later.

388
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,331
I'm not hungry. You go ahead.

389
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,381
Be honest with me.

390
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,840
About what?

391
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,259
You only took on her case

392
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,137
because she wanted custody
of her child, right?

393
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,238
PARENTAL RIGHTS AND CUSTODY

394
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,572
COMMON-LAW MARRIAGE COMPENSATION

395
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,832
Your office looks quite antique.

396
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,626
It is a bit shabby, isn't it?

397
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,003
But then,

398
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:38,591
it has this Korean, original, vintage
vibe going on, doesn't it?

399
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,053
What the hell, man?

400
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,141
Mr. Jang, could you get us
something to drink?

401
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,976
Sure thing. Right away, sir.

402
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:48,977
Okay.

403
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,107
Sorry about that.

404
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,819
So…

405
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,572
did you move back into your home?

406
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,574
I did.

407
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,828
I know it's tough,
but you need to hang in there.

408
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,038
I'm good at that.

409
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,459
Before I file a counterclaim,

410
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,503
I need to go over a few details.

411
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,298
So…

412
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,133
Let's not beat around the bush.

413
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,470
You don't need to be nice to me.

414
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,889
Ask me exactly what you need to know.

415
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,223
Thank you.

416
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,601
When did you start having an affair?

417
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,519
About a year ago.

418
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,992
PRODUCER BANG HO-YEONG

419
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,584
You always binge-eat
during rating survey periods.

420
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,919
Are you that nervous?

421
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,837
Of course. The ads are at stake.

422
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,006
This place is great.

423
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,549
My friend owns this restaurant.

424
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,510
They got a new chef
and the response has been great.

425
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,386
It is good.

426
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,848
Excuse me.

427
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,893
I'm a big fan of yours

428
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,478
and I was nervous to be cooking for you.

429
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,979
How do you like it?

430
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,191
It's good. Thank you.

431
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,737
It's really good.

432
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,365
Your boss told me a lot about you.

433
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,826
Thank you.

434
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,995
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

435
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,542
I'm sorry.

436
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,710
He must be a huge fan.

437
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,879
He can't take his eyes off you.

438
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,464
I bet his heart is racing.

439
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,383
Don't make jokes like that.

440
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,926
Please.

441
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,095
Okay.

442
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,141
Eat up.

443
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,905
It felt nice

444
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,577
to know that someone
still had butterflies for me.

445
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,954
That's how I felt back then.

446
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,500
I kept going back.

447
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,377
To the restaurant?

448
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,462
Whenever I was there,

449
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,506
I felt like I was radiant.

450
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,177
Did you and your husband often argue
about similar matters?

451
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,138
This was the first time.

452
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,849
Come in.

453
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,563
Allow me, Sae-bom.

454
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,647
All right.

455
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,986
Here.

456
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,366
In that case…

457
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,660
Well…

458
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,717
Mr. Jang.

459
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,676
Yes?

460
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,720
Please close the door.

461
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,846
Okay.

462
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,144
Sorry about that.

463
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,146
Please.

464
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,370
Do most husbands

465
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,415
memorize all of their wives' underwear?

466
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,461
Mine does.

467
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,589
He remembers all of them.

468
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,093
Even the ones that were gifts
or ones I don't even wear.

469
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,680
He keeps a record of them

470
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,057
by taking photos every morning and night.

471
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,978
I knew I'd get caught one day.

472
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,938
But I didn't…

473
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,401
expect everything to go down in flames.

474
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,319
And when did your husband find out

475
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,363
about your affair?

476
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,365
After the video got leaked.

477
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,994
I ran away from an asshole
and right into another.

478
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,375
Was it really

479
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,003
that wrong of me?

480
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,215
Adultery is considered marital misconduct,
so that's on you.

481
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,135
As for the leak,

482
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,597
you have every right
to be angry about that.

483
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,891
What a piece of shit.

484
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,769
You're very unusual.

485
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,937
Thank you.

486
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,818
The mediation date is already set,
so we don't have that much time.

487
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,902
But nevertheless,

488
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,196
we should prepare for it.

489
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,661
Right.

490
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,415
What should I wear that day?

491
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,751
-Sorry?
-All black?

492
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,919
No, I'd look too overbearing.

493
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,338
Flats would be better than heels, right?

494
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,927
I was just kidding.

495
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,555
You're in high spirits.

496
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,225
Do you have high heels

497
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,478
that make you super tall?

498
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,149
I was just kidding.

499
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,651
Just dress however you want.

500
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,905
I should go shopping.

501
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,789
That was exhausting.

502
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,465
58,900 won.

503
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,217
Let's round it up to 60,000 won.

504
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,427
I don't trust you, but deal.

505
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,939
Your container?

506
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,658
Stop right there.

507
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,786
Hey, why do you get three heads
when I only get two?

508
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:27,208
I get three small ones,
and you get two big ones.

509
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,584
I think it's fair.

510
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,585
-"Fair"?
-Yes.

511
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,587
Your container is deeper than mine.

512
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,965
You're obviously getting more.

513
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,258
Yours is wider…

514
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,052
We don't have a kitchen scale.

515
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,887
-Should I bring the bathroom scale?
-Hey.

516
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,765
It was 58,900 won, so I paid 60,000 won.

517
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,642
I paid 1,100 won more.

518
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,853
Then I should at least…

519
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,980
-What's this?
-I didn't stash it away.

520
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,606
I was going to give it to you.

521
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,774
-Did you think--
-Hey.

522
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,068
You stashed the filling
and the sauce away.

523
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,112
-I didn't stash--
-So that's how it is?

524
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,905
-I was going to--
-Give it to me.

525
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,408
I'll take all of this and call it even.

526
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,577
-Not all of it.
-All of it!

527
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,703
You can't take it all.

528
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,122
-What will I make kimchi jjigae with?
-Hey, I paid 1,100 won more.

529
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,457
-This is worth more than that.
-Shut up and pour it in.

530
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,753
That's more like it.

531
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,173
You thieving bastard.

532
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,550
I need at least some of it.

533
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,887
-Put that leaf down.
-It's not kimchi without any of this.

534
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,139
Just take the radish. Enough.

535
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,474
Okay. Is that a deal?

536
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,601
Fine.

537
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,356
There's no more.

538
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:56,274
From time to time

539
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,986
PURPOSE OF COUNTERCLAIM

540
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,284
And I bury my pain

541
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,580
Deep inside my laughter

542
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,376
"TES BRO!"
NA HOON-A

543
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,962
I am thankful that I can

544
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,716
Live another day

545
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:27,013
But I am afraid

546
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,892
Of the days that are to come

547
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,689
Brother Tes

548
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,277
This world is too painful

549
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,323
For a crybaby like me

550
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,035
Brother Tes

551
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,748
Brother Socrates

552
00:38:53,831 --> 00:39:00,838
Why does time have to fly by?

553
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,801
INTERCOM
INCOMING CALL

554
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,969
Hello?

555
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,346
Do you know what time it is?

556
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,056
Sorry?

557
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,475
I can't sleep because of you.

558
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,518
Okay, I'm sorry.

559
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,436
What the…

560
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,531
Brother Tes

561
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,078
Brother Tes

562
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,206
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

563
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,582
MEDIATION ROOM

564
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:43,255
MEDIATION SCHEDULE

565
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,025
On March 24 last year,

566
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,403
it was parent participation day

567
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,738
at my client's son, Hyeon-u's school.

568
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,866
Ms. Lee had promised him
that she would be there.

569
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,495
However, she never showed up.

570
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,332
Hyeon-u was so disappointed
that he stormed out during class.

571
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,710
I've submitted his testimony
that he was upset

572
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,295
and wanted to leave the school.

573
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,131
And that day,

574
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,174
he fell while climbing
over the school wall

575
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,884
and was taken to the hospital.

576
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,595
His teacher stayed with him
until his guardian arrived.

577
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,892
Naturally, the teacher called Ms. Lee,
since she is his mother.

578
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,644
She called ten times.

579
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,729
But she never picked up.

580
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,857
Why do you think that was?

581
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,908
What are you doing?

582
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,162
You look insanely beautiful right now.
You're gorgeous.

583
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,122
I'll show you later.

584
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,832
Stop it.

585
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,127
You should have continued pursuing acting.

586
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,547
I'm serious. Stop it.

587
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,924
Okay. I'll delete it right away.

588
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,429
But you do look really pretty.

589
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,097
This won't do.

590
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,600
Come here.

591
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,816
Lie down.

592
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,572
How are you so pretty?

593
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,908
I just don't get it

594
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,454
Come on.

595
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,457
Give it back.

596
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,876
It's ruining the mood. Later.

597
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,002
You can check it later.

598
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,879
-You always do whatever you want.
-Hey.

599
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,798
That's not true.

600
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,384
Fine.

601
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,846
I'll erase the video I just took. Look.

602
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,933
Happy?

603
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,020
I'll put our phones here.

604
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,572
Aren't you Ms. Lee Seo-jin?

605
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,868
I'm a really

606
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,496
big fan of yours.

607
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,835
Not everyone who's lonely cheats.

608
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,381
But it could happen. It's their choice.

609
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:35,052
But it's also perfectly reasonable
for my client

610
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:39,306
to not want his only son
to be with his mother.

611
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,685
His mother was in an explicit video.

612
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,812
How will the boy handle that?

613
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,568
I guess her written explanation
wasn't very thorough,

614
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:54,947
seeing how she's going on and on
about something that we all know.

615
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,282
You're right.

616
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,867
Not everyone who's lonely cheats.

617
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,161
You're absolutely right.

618
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,204
But let me ask you.

619
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,791
Do you think Ms. Lee had an affair
because she was lonely?

620
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,251
That was rhetorical.

621
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,628
She cheated out of loneliness?

622
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,508
Sir, I refuse to accept that.

623
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:20,222
My client wasn't invited
to her closest friend's wedding.

624
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:26,145
HER HUSBAND SEEMED NICE TOO.
SEND US THE PHOTOS.

625
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,484
Even a friend who lived in Canada
was invited to the wedding.

626
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,071
But despite living in the same area
and being her closest friend,

627
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,698
she wasn't invited.

628
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,076
Even though she was a celebrity
who could have brightened up the day.

629
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,454
Why do you think that was?

630
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,332
Why wasn't Ms. Lee invited?

631
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,291
That was because

632
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:52,713
all of her friends were fed up.

633
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,840
-Look here.
-No matter where

634
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,425
or with whom she was,

635
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,178
she had to send him a photo of herself

636
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,889
with the people she was with
every 30 minutes.

637
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,099
Is that reasonable as well?

638
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:09,104
Ms. Lee has never gone to a team dinner
with her colleagues on her show.

639
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,690
Actually, let me correct myself.

640
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,108
She never got to attend them.

641
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,109
Why?

642
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,821
Because she didn't want to create
an awkward situation

643
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,617
where even the staff members
would have to be in those photos.

644
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,661
As a result,

645
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:28,999
her friends and acquaintances
have cut all ties with her.

646
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,211
Can we really say that it had
nothing to do with Mr. Kang?

647
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,504
Let me ask you this.

648
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:37,216
Do you think her inappropriate demeanor
has nothing to do with it?

649
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,385
Please calm down.

650
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,846
I already explained it
thoroughly on paper,

651
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,724
but since he claims that I made it all up,

652
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,767
here's something

653
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,894
that I brought for you.

654
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,526
These are the notes
that Ms. Lee received from her husband

655
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,654
over the past three years.

656
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,865
She found them on the fridge,
front door, bathroom mirror, vanity,

657
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,909
and many other places.

658
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,452
Let's take a look at them.

659
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:11,375
You fall head over heels
for every young male guest on your show.

660
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,421
Listen to today's episode yourself
and see how cheap and shallow you sound.

661
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,055
Did you buy this ridiculous underwear
with your own money?

662
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,723
Do you have a side job?

663
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,645
She started collecting them
three years ago,

664
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,272
but she's been receiving

665
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,192
these humiliating notes
for over seven years.

666
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,986
What was even more suffocating

667
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,990
were the security cameras
that were installed throughout the house.

668
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,992
He installed six cameras

669
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,328
in their house that's around 40 pyeong.

670
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,331
There was even a camera
in the dressing room.

671
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,499
Is this normal?

672
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,565
Therefore,

673
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,944
I don't think my client is
the only one at fault here.

674
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:26,200
He was inhumane enough
to humiliate, insult,

675
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,077
and oppress his wife.
Isn't he at fault as well?

676
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,663
Sure. As a woman myself,

677
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,249
I empathize with Ms. Lee.

678
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,251
However,

679
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,670
being involved in such a shocking video

680
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,632
surely does not help in raising her son.

681
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,510
Especially when he's about to
go through puberty.

682
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,969
Let me get this straight.

683
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,263
Do you think their son will be safe

684
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,599
from the obsession and abuse
that was directed at Ms. Lee?

685
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,850
That's an assumption.

686
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,895
Have you ever thought
of what will happen to Hyeon-u

687
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,273
if he comes across that video
in the future?

688
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,401
Sir, we've wiped the video
off the internet.

689
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,612
Jung Ji-hun, the assailant,
is now incarcerated

690
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,156
and has paid for the tape
to be taken down.

691
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,075
Do you really think so?

692
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,122
My client is desperate
to raise his son properly.

693
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:18,210
So it was only natural
for him to make sure

694
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,921
that the video was no longer on the web.

695
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,383
Last night, my client confirmed

696
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,595
that Ms. Lee's video
was still being distributed online.

697
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,599
If you want, I can show you on his phone.

698
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,645
It is very possible that Hyeon-u
could find the video himself

699
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,356
in the near future.

700
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:44,069
It would be shocking enough
if he was no longer living with her.

701
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,529
But if they live together?

702
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,656
You said my client was inhumane.

703
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:52,119
Do you think it's humane
to leave Hyeon-u with such a mother?

704
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,328
Sir.

705
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,707
This situation right now…

706
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,377
is a blatant case

707
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,047
of secondary victimization toward Ms. Lee.

708
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,851
Look.

709
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:20,272
Ms. Lee was initially victimized
when the sex tape was leaked.

710
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,318
Not only did she lose a job
that she's had for four years,

711
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:28,113
but her everyday life has fallen apart
beyond our imagination.

712
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:32,034
Is it okay for your sex tape
to be leaked if you're an adulteress?

713
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,953
She's a victim of a heinous crime.

714
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,914
She's fighting for custody of her son

715
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,376
because she refuses to subject him
to the same abuse that she received.

716
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,961
Why should she be discriminated against?

717
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,756
There have been many cases
where the adulterer

718
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,300
won custody of their child.

719
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,929
So why is it a reason
that she can't have custody of her child?

720
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,016
-Because the video is still--
-Exactly.

721
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,852
You're claiming
that she can't raise her own son

722
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,231
because her sex tape was leaked.

723
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:08,487
That's a blatant case of
secondary victimization.

724
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,864
Do you understand that?

725
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,495
Sir.

726
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,336
Let's wrap up today's session here.

727
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,671
At the next session,

728
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,714
Hyeon-u's psychotherapy results

729
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,342
will be revised.

730
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,660
I'd like to meet with Hyeon-u.
Would that be okay?

731
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,495
You can be there if you'd like.

732
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,165
He won't talk if I'm there.

733
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,126
I'll ask him.

734
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,298
-Hey, Hyeong-geun. It's me.
-What's up?

735
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,092
I need you to go down
to the police station tomorrow.

736
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,510
The police station? Why?

737
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:59,055
Apparently, Ms. Lee's video
is still being distributed.

738
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,015
What?

739
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,476
I need you to find out
more details about it.

740
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,852
That little… All right.

741
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,312
Hold on.

742
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,273
Do your absolute best as her fan.

743
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,524
I'll put my life on the line.

744
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,817
-Okay.
-Okay.

745
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,059
Can you tell me who that is?

746
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,018
Dad.

747
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,729
Then this must be you.

748
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,688
Yes.

749
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,816
Then…

750
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,860
who's that fish with sunglasses?

751
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,153
Mom.

752
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:58,907
She plays by herself all the time.

753
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,756
What did you get?

754
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,260
-The fishbowl question.
-Did you draw properly?

755
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,013
Did you draw what I told you to draw?

756
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,140
Yes.

757
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,311
Your mother has some nerve,
causing this huge mess.

758
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,480
That lunatic.

759
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,115
Yes?

760
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,908
Hey.

761
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,203
I just got back from the police station.

762
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,163
I did my best as her fan.

763
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,165
Well done. What did they say?

764
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,126
Since the leak was found early,

765
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,588
they had it under control
relatively quickly.

766
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,548
They said they'd check again.

767
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,676
But they searched Jung Ji-hun's house
and erased the video

768
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,177
from his hard drive and cloud.

769
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,513
Where on earth did he find it then?

770
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,682
-It's still around?
-Apparently.

771
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,476
Where are you going?

772
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,728
I'll get to the bottom of it.

773
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,064
-What about lunch?
-How can I eat right now?

774
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,066
I love his attitude. That's a real fan.

775
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,528
What could it be?

776
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,489
What could it be?

777
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,826
Were they just bluffing?

778
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:30,290
MYEONGSEONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

779
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,292
I've been watching him for a few days,

780
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,711
and he doesn't seem gloomy.

781
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,465
They say kids whose parents fight
all the time tend to look depressed.

782
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,342
But that wasn't the case for him.

783
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,135
There he is.

784
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,387
-Where?
-The kid with the blue backpack.

785
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,348
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

786
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,807
Hyeon-u.

787
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:50,936
Hyeon-u?

788
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,954
You must be uncomfortable.

789
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,874
I'm sorry that we have to talk about
something like this when we just met.

790
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,128
Let me tell you why we're here. Well--

791
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,089
Mr. Jang.

792
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,884
I'd appreciate it if you ate over there.

793
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,680
But my burger is here.

794
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,599
Well, in that case…

795
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,060
I'll just move my burger…

796
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,979
And get you some fries…

797
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,899
You can eat over there now, right?

798
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,109
Happy?

799
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,784
Wait. No.

800
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,370
You're supposed to like the window seat.

801
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,163
I mean, you like the window seat.

802
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,790
Oh, that's right.

803
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,376
I forgot that I like
sitting by the window.

804
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,545
Take your time.

805
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,422
You have a bad stomach.

806
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,548
Okay.

807
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,513
Here.

808
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,890
Do you like beef burgers?

809
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,475
Or do you want mine?

810
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,477
I'm not a picky eater.

811
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,272
Really? Here you go then.

812
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,860
Help yourself.

813
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,751
So how's therapy going?

814
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,504
Good.

815
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,717
This is between your parents.

816
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,969
And you're caught up in it.

817
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,139
I want it to be over soon.

818
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,141
Yes. Me too.

819
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,477
And so does your mother.

820
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,610
Who will I live with?

821
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,489
Who do you want to live with?

822
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,701
You don't need to tell me.

823
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,580
Ever heard of
"the right to remain silent"?

824
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:19,000
It means you don't have to talk
if you don't feel like it.

825
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,168
Legally speaking.

826
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,922
Eat up.

827
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,726
Hey, doesn't it feel like

828
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,521
we're doing a mukbang or something?

829
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,525
Do you like watching mukbang?

830
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,486
-I like playing games.
-Games?

831
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,696
I don't like playing games.

832
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,700
My job is all about winning or losing,
and so are games.

833
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,828
It'd be too stressful.

834
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,914
It could help you relieve stress.

835
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,542
Playing games.

836
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,923
You must be under a lot of stress too.

837
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,803
What troubles you the most these days?

838
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,812
Remaining silent already?

839
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,489
I wish I had bad memory.

840
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,168
What do you not want to remember?

841
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,006
Just some things I saw.

842
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,050
Things like that.

843
00:57:56,514 --> 00:58:00,852
You mean how your parents
would get into big fights?

844
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,583
I want to go.

845
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,044
Okay.

846
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,213
Let's go. Where are you headed?

847
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,797
To the academy.

848
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,008
Do you need a ride?

849
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,677
No, I can go by myself.

850
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,273
Hyeon-u.

851
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,571
You are by far

852
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,742
the strongest third-grader I know.

853
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,376
I hate my mom.

854
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,505
She didn't answer my teacher's call.

855
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,883
She declined it.

856
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,764
I waited a long time at the hospital.

857
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,393
But my dad came instead.

858
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,233
You must have been waiting for your mom.

859
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,902
I wish I could erase her…

860
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,906
from my memory.

861
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,184
What's with the face?

862
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,478
Does he want to live with his dad?

863
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,440
I don't know.

864
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,069
This is so complicated and frustrating.

865
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,782
I feel bad for him.

866
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,078
I don't know.

867
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,269
Hyeon-u.

868
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,979
-Hyeon-u.
-Hyeon-u!

869
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,939
-Hyeon-u!
-Snap out of it, Hyeon-u!

870
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,107
I'll call 911!

871
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,485
-Hey!
-Hyeon-u!

872
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,904
Hyeon-u!

873
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,031
-Hyeon-u!
-What's with you?

874
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,324
-Get it together, Hyeon-u!
-Let go!

875
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,410
What's the matter, Hyeon-u?

876
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,953
Hyeon-u!

877
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,747
Please snap out of it.

878
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,001
Hyeon-u!

879
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,302
She didn't answer my teacher's call.

880
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,471
She declined it.

881
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,474
I wish I had bad memory.

882
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,120
Brother Tes

883
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,331
What's wrong with this world?

884
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:54,043
Why do I feel so uneasy?

885
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,004
Brother Tes

886
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,673
Brother Soc--

887
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,799
What the heck?

888
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,885
Lee Seo-jin?

889
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,805
Hello?

890
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,683
Attorney Shin.

891
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,937
Let's stop here.

892
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,565
Is something wrong?

893
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,692
It's Hyeon-u.

894
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,195
He's in the hospital.

895
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,782
He suddenly started throwing a fit.

896
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,246
This is all very hard on him.

897
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,248
He threw a fit?

898
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,333
He was suddenly screaming, crying,

899
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,961
and gasping for air.

900
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,841
He's in so much pain.

901
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:48,431
His dad picked up the phone to call 911.

902
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,476
Hyeon-u snatched it away and threw it.

903
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,103
He kept throwing it.

904
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,565
Let's stop here.

905
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,736
I should have been
more worried about Hyeon-u.

906
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,248
I understand, Ms. Lee.

907
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,001
We can end

908
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:18,920
the divorce mediation.

909
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,215
Once he calms down,

910
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,175
go out,

911
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,012
find yourself a restaurant
that's open 24/7,

912
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,390
and have a hearty meal.

913
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,394
Mr. Shin.

914
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,356
-Did you not get what I said?
-I did.

915
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,441
I understand.

916
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,903
You'll need the energy to have a trial.

917
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,031
This is no longer a divorce mediation.

918
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:49,909
It's a trial.

919
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,703
We will win.

920
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,331
We will win.

921
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,666
We are going to win.

922
01:03:58,751 --> 01:03:59,961
So eat up.

923
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:19,522
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

924
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,556
Those careless words.

925
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,559
You already know, don't you?

926
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,185
What did you say about his dignity?

927
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,104
Don't be so scared.

928
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,107
I'm sorry.

929
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:08,070
I know why you left everything
in Germany and came here.

930
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,531
A former pianist turned attorney?

931
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,409
That's just ridiculous.

932
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,662
Are you going to fight him
once you're done coloring the grapes?

933
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,749
I'm going to kill him.

934
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:27,757
