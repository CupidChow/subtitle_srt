DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

3
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,505
EPISODE 6

4
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,742
For you, Mom and Dad.

5
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,704
And for you, Ju-hwa.

6
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,837
Goodness.

7
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,776
HERE LIES SHIN JU-HWA
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

8
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,074
Mom, Dad, just flowers for you today.

9
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,576
It's Ju-hwa's birthday.

10
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,250
Listen up, everybody.

11
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,504
Seriously.

12
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,590
You can't do this to me, guys.

13
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,133
Okay?

14
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,720
I've realized something about myself.

15
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,767
I'm quite soft-hearted.

16
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,893
I'm a softie.

17
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,982
You should have lived to be at least 80.

18
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,319
Dad, I know I'm not the one to talk,

19
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,656
but I knew you drank way too much.

20
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,242
And you.

21
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,660
Shin Ju-hwa.

22
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,246
You should feel the worst.

23
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,166
Our generation is expected
to live to be 100.

24
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,210
So what's this?

25
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,257
Do I have to keep living like this?

26
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,093
I have to…

27
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,181
I have to live all alone…

28
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,434
until I'm 100.

29
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,480
When I think about that…

30
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,740
I don't know how I'm going to live.

31
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,409
Is this an office or a study group?

32
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,496
Good grief.

33
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,206
I mean--

34
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,875
Good morning.

35
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,759
It's past lunchtime.

36
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,428
What's that on his face?

37
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,764
Under-eye patches?

38
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,194
-Sae-bom.
-Yes?

39
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,198
Do you have the list of people
who left their numbers for consultations?

40
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,283
Yes.

41
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,368
Where did I put it?

42
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,456
Are we calling to ask
if they still need help?

43
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,503
Attorney Choi, I heard you're
looking for a house near the…

44
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,426
Thank you

45
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,094
for the flowers.

46
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,847
I didn't get to thank you last time.

47
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,356
What happened?

48
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,319
So you're actually embarrassed?

49
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,656
I've practically finished
digesting my lunch by now.

50
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,825
And you come in here
saying "good morning"?

51
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,870
I didn't know what else to say.

52
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,041
Just say "good day"
or carry around an emoji sign.

53
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,959
You're stressing me out.

54
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,425
Give me a break, man.

55
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,354
Come here.

56
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,995
What the hell?

57
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,831
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Your face scared me more!

58
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,874
Go look in a mirror.

59
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,084
You look in a mirror!

60
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,210
You little…

61
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,796
You're unbelievable.

62
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,047
Your pores are like…

63
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,550
What the hell?

64
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,509
Man.

65
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,803
You went to see Ju-hwa.

66
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,766
Did you actually put a tail on me?

67
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,895
Both Jeong-sik and I know
that today's her birthday, you prick.

68
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,398
Get that tissue off your face.

69
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,983
You ass.

70
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,161
Damn it.

71
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,338
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

72
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,634
You know what today is, right?

73
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,969
What?

74
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,555
I don't know what it is, but…

75
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,639
I don't know.

76
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,558
You inconsiderate jerk.

77
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,686
Mr. Jang, we're supposed
to have a meeting today.

78
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,439
So…

79
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,945
Is Mr. Shin Sung-han in?

80
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,533
He's out on business right now.
Do you have an appointment?

81
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,702
You don't seem busy.

82
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,329
Do I need one?

83
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,498
Yes, he's available by appointment only,
and he has a full day today.

84
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,708
-Lady!
-Let me…

85
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,877
Let me assist you.

86
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,799
Come in.

87
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,853
Oh…

88
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,484
I knew you'd be surprised,

89
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,361
but I'm starting to get worried now.

90
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,279
You're breathing, right?

91
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,704
It's been a long time.

92
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,789
Yes.

93
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,084
We haven't met
since your parents' funeral.

94
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,169
Right.

95
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,217
So…

96
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,595
would you like some tea?

97
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,472
Let's skip over that.

98
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,809
We'd have to make small talk
while we wait for tea.

99
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,144
Neither of us wants that.

100
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,314
May I sit here?

101
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm here to ask you something.

102
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,546
Sure.

103
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,713
About Ju-hwa.

104
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,841
Gi-yeong's mother.

105
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,385
Where is she?

106
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,642
I'm asking if you buried her
somewhere nice

107
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,270
or if you placed her remains
in a nice columbarium.

108
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,986
You seem taken aback by my question.

109
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,323
I think you have questions for me.

110
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,244
"Why do you ask? Why do you want to know?"

111
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,707
"Are you saying none of you know
where my sister rests?"

112
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,460
Don't you want to ask me?

113
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,838
You must be speechless and frustrated.

114
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,300
I can't think of anything nice to say.

115
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,219
What's the meaning of this?

116
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,307
It's simple.

117
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,143
I…

118
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,313
couldn't come when she passed away.

119
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,691
I wanted to pay my respects

120
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,359
now that I'm back in Korea,

121
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,571
but my son said he doesn't know.

122
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,074
And my new daughter-in-law
doesn't seem to be of good character,

123
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,701
so I doubt that she knows.

124
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,122
So I shamelessly showed up here,
using my old age as an excuse.

125
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,332
Simple, isn't it?

126
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,667
No, thank you.

127
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,674
It's far too late for you
to be paying respects to my sister.

128
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,761
Okay.

129
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,597
I guess I'll find out on my own.

130
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,643
But I applaud your character.

131
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,479
You remained calm without cursing me out.

132
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,647
Could it be…

133
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,149
because you're an artist?

134
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,236
-I'm an attorney.
-That's why I wanted to come.

135
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,114
You're Ju-hwa's brother.
I was curious about you.

136
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,710
If you ever plan to get a divorce,

137
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,088
please make an appointment.

138
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,965
I'll give you

139
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,467
a wholehearted consultation.

140
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,774
Ms. Yu.

141
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,858
Who is she?

142
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,861
His sister's mother-in-law.

143
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,447
In-law, my ass. She ran off ages ago.

144
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,408
Shouldn't you get back to work?

145
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,618
Who cares about work right now?

146
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,205
Sung-han is getting walked all over again.

147
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,290
Let's go in.

148
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,834
Come on.

149
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,508
Go back to your office.

150
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,640
I don't need a wholehearted consultation.

151
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,184
Can you win any case?

152
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,734
You even gave up on your passion
for the piano to become an attorney.

153
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,403
I got on the plane,

154
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,114
thinking you could turn my life around.

155
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,159
But I should stop dreaming.

156
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,454
I'm not sure what you're
talking about right now.

157
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,457
Are you going to be here for a while?

158
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,250
Because if so…

159
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,630
I might stop being so polite.

160
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,392
Mr. Shin.

161
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,688
If you're tenacious like me,
you can keep on living.

162
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,566
If you're kind like Ju-hwa,

163
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,653
you'll keep living as an attorney
until you face an untimely death.

164
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,570
Ms. Ma.

165
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,238
I told you, didn't I?

166
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,950
Kindness is a weakness.

167
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,119
You should have kept that in mind.

168
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,372
You just had to have an affair
with such a lowly woman.

169
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,499
Has she gone insane?

170
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,835
How dare she reach out
to a kid studying abroad?

171
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,296
Did you give her Min-su's number
and ask her to contact him?

172
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,174
-You're insane.
-You're one to talk.

173
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,884
You two are the insane ones here!

174
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,721
Studying abroad is tough as it is.

175
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,681
Aren't you ashamed to see him?

176
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,100
Park Ji-yeon, aren't you ashamed?

177
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,019
You don't care if your husband dies,

178
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,646
and you go about your life
doing whatever you want.

179
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,772
You'll pay for it.

180
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,482
You'll pay for your behavior!

181
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,359
I said I have something to say.

182
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,863
This doesn't concern you.

183
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,323
-Go back tomorrow.
-I have something to say!

184
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,367
Please hear me out.

185
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,745
I looked into this.

186
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,832
I'm over 15, so I can
donate my organs if I want to.

187
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,625
Hey, are you crazy?

188
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,044
Is that bitch behind this?

189
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,047
Did that bitch tell you
to donate your liver?

190
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,798
No, it's my own decision.

191
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,676
-Min-su, no!
-I'll donate my liver.

192
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,012
So stop making me study abroad
when I don't even want to!

193
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,930
I'll give you my liver.

194
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,308
You two can sort out your divorce.

195
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,642
I'll give you my liver.

196
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,394
So let's just stop this.

197
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,353
Choi Min-su.

198
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,190
Are you going to make me feel so small?

199
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,319
What are you going to do
after you give up and come back?

200
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,906
-You think you'll be able to keep up here?
-I don't have to go to college!

201
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,199
You're a professor's son!

202
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,159
-How can you not go to college?
-Mom.

203
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,411
Do you know how many times I collapsed?

204
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,872
I have panic disorder. Do you even know?

205
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,501
Everyone has panic disorder these days.

206
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,879
-Do you think school will be easy here?
-You know what?

207
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,090
You don't care if your son is sick

208
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,634
or if your husband is terminally ill!

209
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,261
-How do you live with yourself?
-It's not just your studies.

210
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,263
You'll have to go to the army too.

211
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,015
What if your health is affected?

212
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,809
No parent would say yes to this!

213
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,185
So just get divorced, Mom!

214
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,022
That woman will donate her liver
instead of you or me!

215
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,860
Min-su.

216
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,154
Min-su!

217
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,997
Don't shampoo your hair today.

218
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,291
Welcome.

219
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,627
What should I use if my hair gets too dry?

220
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,712
Right.

221
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,006
Try using this one.

222
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,218
-How much do I owe you?
-It's on the house!

223
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,053
Really? What's going on today?

224
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,721
Nothing's going on.

225
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,682
-Bye now.
-Okay.

226
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,933
Goodbye!

227
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,404
You must know shame.

228
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,822
Why are you locking the door?

229
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,366
Let's have some courtesy, okay?
Why are you here?

230
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,326
You contacted my son
behind my back, you tramp.

231
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,036
So why am I not allowed to be here?

232
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,497
-"Tramp"?
-What should I call you then?

233
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,249
"Crazy bitch"?

234
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,458
So unsophisticated.

235
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,169
Look who's talking.

236
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,796
You? A professor's wife?

237
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,965
Don't kid yourself.

238
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,509
And you're toying around
with a person's life.

239
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,677
You think you're sane?

240
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,846
Did you want to go
from being a hairdresser

241
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,307
to being a professor's wife
by giving him your liver?

242
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,018
If that's your conclusion,
go ahead and think as you like.

243
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,228
But you know,

244
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,774
you're also desperate to keep living
as a professor's wife, aren't you?

245
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,030
Choi Jeong-ho, you picked
the lowest woman of them all.

246
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,617
I'm the one who made him a professor.

247
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,995
I quit my job
just before I became a chief editor.

248
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,705
It wasn't an easy decision.

249
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,999
Do you think I didn't have dreams?

250
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,045
I gave up and became a housewife
to give him my full support.

251
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,546
Do you have any idea?

252
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,924
You dare to have an affair with him

253
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,592
and demand a divorce?

254
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,843
Is that why

255
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,347
you'd rather watch him die
than get a divorce?

256
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,808
-You're so pathetic.
-You!

257
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,935
"Pathetic"?

258
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,937
How dare you say that to me?

259
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,941
What the hell are you doing?

260
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,278
-What?
-Let go of me!

261
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,529
You evil…

262
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,698
I didn't do anything wrong!

263
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,078
You little…

264
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,997
Damn you!

265
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,258
About Professor Choi Jeong-ho's case.

266
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,972
Will Shin Sung-han really take it?

267
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,935
I'm not sure,
but I think they've been talking.

268
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,106
It's just a matter of time
before you lose your mind

269
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,275
when you believe in the wrong principles.

270
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,405
Does he really think he can win that?

271
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,116
Any other updates?

272
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,742
No.

273
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,663
By the way,

274
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,999
why am I having what you're having?

275
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,001
So we get served faster.

276
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,429
His sister's mother-in-law came by,

277
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,931
so things got really uncomfortable
in the office.

278
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,183
-And…
-Mother-in-law?

279
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,477
Yes, that's what they said.

280
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,441
MA GEUM-HUI

281
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,111
Too spicy.

282
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,282
Was this her?

283
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,786
I knew she looked familiar.

284
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,496
She's an actress, right?

285
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,207
Is she not?

286
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,001
A newscaster?

287
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,713
No?

288
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,882
You're really good at drawing.

289
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,426
What are you drawing, Ha-yul?

290
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,928
-Nature.
-Is that so?

291
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,392
Will Jeong-guk be home late?

292
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,727
Yes.

293
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,313
He said his dinner is running late.

294
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,357
Gi-yeong.

295
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,446
Grandma, it's time for my English lesson.

296
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,074
You were studying
until a minute ago. Already?

297
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,535
I'll be done after English.

298
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,916
Good night.

299
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,128
Ha-yul, it's time for bed.

300
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,923
Do you take

301
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,968
Gi-yeong to his mother sometimes?

302
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,346
No.

303
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,308
He hasn't asked yet.

304
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,811
So you're not keeping him away from her?

305
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,063
Why would I do that, Mother?

306
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,274
Where does she rest?

307
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,237
I'm not so sure.

308
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,655
What about Jeong-guk?

309
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,365
Does he know?

310
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,367
I'm not sure.

311
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,494
You're living this life

312
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,497
after she passed away.

313
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,583
How do you sleep at night?

314
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,883
Excuse me.

315
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,803
Yes, ma'am?

316
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,763
Please tuck Ha-yul in.

317
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,557
Ha-yul.

318
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,067
Ha-yul was listening.

319
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,735
Exactly.

320
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,154
The kids are growing up.

321
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,285
Find out where Gi-yeong's mother is.

322
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,746
It'll be uncomfortable for you,
so I'll take him.

323
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,292
Don't do that, Mother.

324
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,590
This is my family.

325
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,847
I'm so silly.

326
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,308
I can never hold back my laughter.

327
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,268
Yeong-ju.

328
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,438
It used to be
Gi-yeong's family, didn't it?

329
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,398
It was mine to begin with.

330
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,526
If you hadn't disapproved of me,

331
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,529
we wouldn't have had to take a detour.

332
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,115
In the end, I'm the one who's here.

333
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,742
Exactly.

334
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,537
I wouldn't even be talking to you
if my son didn't choose to be with you.

335
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,291
It was her birthday today.

336
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,337
I'll take Gi-yeong
and leave her some flowers.

337
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,796
Mark my words.

338
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,691
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

339
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,568
Cancel his insurance?

340
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,614
He has gone insane.
He's completely out of it.

341
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,660
If he cancels his life insurance,
will I not get a payout?

342
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,036
What about the amount he's paid?

343
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,996
Yes. Right.

344
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,210
He's finally lost it
now that his days are numbered.

345
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,879
I didn't know he could be that bold.

346
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,423
This house is all he's left for us.

347
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,843
My kid and I need the payout to get by!

348
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,137
Anyway, thanks.

349
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,598
I'll talk to him and call you back.

350
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,017
That was the phone call.

351
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,188
The phone call she had
with the plaintiff is much crueler.

352
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,815
Would you like to hear it?

353
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,025
Isn't this illegal?

354
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,987
Your partner, Ms. Kim Ji-suk, said

355
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:17,284
your insurance planner is
a friend of your wife's.

356
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,328
-Is that true?
-Yes, I heard she's a close friend.

357
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,540
And Ms. Park's been
paying for your insurance?

358
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,541
Yes.

359
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,752
Call your insurance company

360
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,881
and tell them you'd like to
cancel all your insurance.

361
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,758
Ask them about the procedure.

362
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,553
Then they'll contact
the payer immediately.

363
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,265
What happens after that?

364
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,433
She'll respond.

365
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,561
And we need to catch how she responds.

366
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,151
You said something
about a criminal record?

367
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,529
Let's hope Ms. Park gives
a dramatic response.

368
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,033
And let's think of a way
to capture her response.

369
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,954
But I doubt there's a legal way
to go about that.

370
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,122
Are you saying

371
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,541
we're going to tap her phone?

372
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,709
I'm just saying

373
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,670
it's do-or-die.

374
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,548
That's the attitude I need from you.

375
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,969
Yes, it is illegal.

376
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,430
It's a breach
of the Communications Secrets Act.

377
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,184
But can you think of how frustrated
Mr. Choi must have been

378
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,061
that he even broke the law?

379
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,145
Choi Jeong-ho.

380
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,981
-You're Min-su's father.
-This…

381
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:31,858
can't be used as evidence.

382
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,152
Given its gravity,
I'll take it into account.

383
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,782
We'll sue the plaintiff

384
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,826
for the breach
of the Communications Secrets Act.

385
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,163
You'll get a criminal record.

386
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,498
Were you aware of it?

387
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,917
I'm going to die anyway.

388
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,753
I don't care if I get a criminal record.

389
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,090
Sue me.

390
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,425
MEDIATION ROOM

391
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,593
Good work.

392
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,929
How are you? Are you okay?

393
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,514
Should we go see the doctor?

394
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,140
You'll be busy, Mr. Choi,

395
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,102
divorcing, registering your marriage,
and getting that liver.

396
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,606
I hope you get healthy
so I can sue you for breaking the law.

397
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,193
A professor with a criminal record?
How dishonorable.

398
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,277
Thank you.

399
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,405
-Good work.
-Thank you.

400
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,367
A criminal record?
What are you talking about?

401
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,828
I'm saying things won't go as you like.

402
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,121
Do you want me to explain?

403
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,082
No, forget it. Just go on your way!

404
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,458
What? Are you disappointed?

405
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,252
You said you'd rather be
widowed than divorced.

406
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,255
-You better stop lying, lady.
-Did you just hit me?

407
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,132
-You said it yourself!
-That's enough.

408
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,633
-What's enough?
-And you.

409
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,593
We'll see how happy your life will be.

410
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,938
PART-TIMERS WANTED

411
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,106
Hello.

412
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,654
-We talked on the phone. I'm Choi Min-su.
-I see.

413
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,239
It's nice to meet you.

414
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,339
Come in.

415
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,140
A client called this morning
to schedule a consultation.

416
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,144
I said I'd call them back
after checking your schedule.

417
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,479
When should I schedule it for?

418
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,856
Well…

419
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,942
You can talk to them whenever you're free.

420
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,236
By myself?

421
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,781
Yes, you're an expert.

422
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,368
I didn't just agree to let you work here

423
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,538
so you could keep Hyeon-u's custody.

424
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,125
You're the best radio DJ there is.

425
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,753
You're a great listener.

426
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,674
It's the perfect work experience
for an intake coordinator here.

427
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,558
Did you wrap up the case well today?

428
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,103
Yes, they agreed to a divorce.

429
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,440
What do I say in situations like this?

430
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,192
"Congratulations"?

431
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,819
"That's a relief"?

432
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,196
Nothing, really.

433
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,615
"Great work."

434
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,283
How's that?

435
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,790
I did do great work,
so that would be great.

436
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,840
It's a good thing
that they got divorced, right?

437
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,595
Once I set my mind to something,
I always do my best.

438
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,807
I'd like to keep track of
all the ongoing cases.

439
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,060
Nobody knows if it was a good thing.

440
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,687
Everything is up to them now.

441
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,190
But how can I put this?

442
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,820
They were like moths flying into a fire.

443
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,991
I don't feel too great about it.

444
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,125
Does this mean you're done
with the grapes then?

445
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,670
You had two left before my case
and then colored one soon after.

446
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,714
There's only one left, and you just won.

447
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,382
Here's a secret.

448
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,135
I color them in even if I lose.

449
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,683
What's your reward when you're done?

450
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,144
My reward?

451
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,230
I'm not sure.

452
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,860
I can finally see the finish line,

453
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,030
but it's only cluttering up my mind.

454
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,035
-One more thing.
-Yes?

455
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,370
It's different.

456
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,920
You wanted to protect Hyeon-u.

457
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,757
Professor Choi and his wife were
both trying to save themselves.

458
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,177
It was different from the beginning.

459
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,552
You know my mother-in-law is back, right?

460
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,096
Yes, I heard.

461
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,056
Her first order was

462
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,768
to find out where Shin Ju-hwa rests.

463
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,314
That must be why Ms. Ma
went to Shin Sung-han's office.

464
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,236
She went there?

465
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,739
Yes. I planted someone in that office.

466
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:17,078
Ms. Ma Geum-hui of Daenam Electronics

467
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,124
went to see Shin Sung-han
and asked about Shin Ju-hwa?

468
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,002
That bothers me.

469
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,590
I need more information on Shin Sung-han.

470
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,427
-Put something together.
-Yes, I'll get it ready.

471
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,512
Also,

472
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,391
I believe my decision
to plant someone in his office

473
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,519
in case something like this happens

474
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,396
was a genius move.

475
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,108
I assume you sent someone smart.

476
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,943
Am I right?

477
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,903
Of course.

478
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,573
No way! This is awesome!

479
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,536
To be honest, I was a little disappointed.

480
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,288
I quit Keumhwa and came here,

481
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,999
but you didn't even bother
to buy me a beer to welcome me.

482
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,876
But I didn't expect you to throw

483
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,170
such a special welcome party for me.

484
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,005
This is great.

485
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,507
It's a welcome party?

486
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,676
I never said anything of that sort.

487
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,306
Wait.

488
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,016
It's not Christmas.

489
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,267
Forget it.

490
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,311
It's what you do when you're out camping.

491
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,937
Well, we don't.

492
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,273
Just let him have it. He's a kid.

493
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,112
We should at least have music.

494
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,447
That's noise pollution.

495
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,282
Have some manners, okay?

496
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,743
Why do you even go camping?

497
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,952
Let's get grilling.

498
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,371
Okay.

499
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,876
Okay.

500
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,682
What are you doing?

501
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,352
I haven't uploaded a video in a while.

502
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,563
My subscribers are
very sensitive these days

503
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,273
after I took down your video.

504
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,819
I was going to make
a camping video with good vibes.

505
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,195
but I shifted gears.

506
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,489
To "no vibes, no fun."

507
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,034
Do you not remember
what happened last time you filmed me?

508
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,411
I'm only filming myself.

509
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,039
Look at the angle. I'm filming myself.

510
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,126
-What the…
-I don't feel comfortable being on camera.

511
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,253
You should have told me beforehand.

512
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,171
We're wearing the same color.

513
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,882
I told you we shouldn't bring him!

514
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,883
Right.

515
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,844
Come on, Attorney Choi.

516
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,762
Put the camera away. Turn it off.

517
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,639
Let's enjoy nature quietly.

518
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,682
I mean,

519
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,559
you should just go to a temple then.

520
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,602
Go ahead.

521
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,524
Don't have any of this.

522
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,777
I'm sorry, sir.
I wasn't thinking when I said that.

523
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,115
Please, allow me.

524
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,576
-Open it for me.
-Yes, sir. Opening it right now.

525
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,785
Goodbye.

526
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,412
Hey, that stings!

527
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,581
-Bye, everyone.
-Is it ready?

528
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,083
I'll be done soon. Give me a moment.

529
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,719
What are you looking at?

530
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,637
I wanted to see where you worked.

531
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,514
How did you get here alone?

532
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
Do you know how to take the bus?

533
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,393
I've been out front before.

534
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:29,896
When?

535
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,189
Back then.

536
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,525
I wanted to give my journal to Mr. Shin.

537
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,112
I see.

538
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,990
But I just went home that day.

539
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,994
I was scared.

540
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:47,914
Of what?

541
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,916
No idea. I don't remember.

542
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,418
I was just scared.

543
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,729
Do you want to eat ramyeon
instead of pork cutlets?

544
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,898
Ramyeon? Can I really?

545
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:14,857
Yes.

546
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,497
Hey, kid.

547
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,290
You're good-looking.

548
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,584
Thank you.

549
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,753
And well-behaved?

550
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,546
You're so cool.

551
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,886
I'm sorry. Enjoy your meal.

552
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,680
I won't bother you.

553
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,894
Why didn't you go camping with them?

554
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,023
It's awkward to eat with them.
Camping would be worse.

555
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,403
I guess it would be tiring.
All three of them are weirdos.

556
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,488
There are four of them now.

557
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,739
There's another one?

558
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,449
A new attorney.

559
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,368
Oh, my.

560
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,954
They hired another weirdo?

561
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,039
Is that a job requirement?

562
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,711
I mean, it's an unlikely mix.

563
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,840
Hyeon-u.

564
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,258
Can I ask you something?

565
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,051
Yes.

566
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,761
How's my ramyeon? Is it good?

567
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,805
Yes.

568
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,183
-Is it not spicy?
-No.

569
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,775
I'll make it less spicy next time.

570
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,860
Okay.

571
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,322
Mom.

572
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,657
Can we go with them next time?

573
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,992
Where?

574
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,578
Camping. I want to try camping too.

575
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,205
You and I can go.

576
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,249
It'll be too quiet if it's just us two.

577
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,918
Camping has to be fun!

578
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,696
You know, a welcome party…

579
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,699
shouldn't be like this.

580
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:35,414
When we're out here,
we should have some nice lights on.

581
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,960
When I bought those lights second-hand…

582
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,505
I was thrilled.

583
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,426
That speaker.

584
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,471
I bought that at the store.

585
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,390
It's brand-new.

586
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,517
Okay?

587
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,186
Okay?

588
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,522
Darn it.

589
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,107
Who am I talking to?

590
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,203
I have headphones too.

591
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,553
I'm so drunk.

592
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,692
Popping.

593
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,411
Popping.

594
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,288
Popping.

595
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,498
Let's tuck him in.

596
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,501
You're good at that, Attorney Choi.

597
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,420
Way to go.

598
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,590
I should start calling you Mr. Popping.

599
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,551
Let's go into the tent.

600
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,595
It's spacious in there.

601
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,888
I really like you.

602
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,808
-I like you too.
-I like you so much.

603
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,143
I like you too.

604
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,520
-What was that?
-You're such a good dancer.

605
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,688
Did he get bitten by a bug?

606
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,441
-Of course I like you.
-Stay with me.

607
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,109
Stay.

608
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,153
Get in here with me.

609
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,530
There you go.

610
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,744
It's so cold.

611
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,997
It's cold.

612
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,998
Good work.

613
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,924
The countless days we spent

614
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,469
Immersed in music

615
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,931
We can never go back

616
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,057
Hyeong-geun.

617
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,142
Yes?

618
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,647
It's time…

619
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,983
you let Ji-eun go.

620
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,237
The song says it's time to say goodbye.

621
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,325
It says time will bring us back together.

622
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,993
I want to go to karaoke.

623
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,703
All of a sudden?

624
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,955
Shut up, you prick.

625
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,414
I can't even talk?

626
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,124
After I made that awesome kimchi stew?

627
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,876
You finished most of it.

628
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,295
As if. Jun had the most.

629
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,172
You ate all the meat, you prick.

630
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,551
-You gave it all to me, you dimwit.
-You took all of it

631
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,511
-while pretending to stir it.
-Shut up.

632
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,680
Let's just never have
a serious conversation.

633
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,140
How do we go from Ji-eun to kimchi stew?

634
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,271
Let her go.

635
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,860
Working on Professor Choi's case
really made me think.

636
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,237
Who's Professor Choi?

637
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,072
You little…

638
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,784
She's having a child,

639
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,787
so she'll have to register
the child's birth.

640
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,208
She's not coming back, is she?

641
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,960
No.

642
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,545
She can't.

643
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,256
You know her better than I do.

644
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,135
She couldn't even call an ambulance.

645
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,886
Even if she breaks up with him,

646
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,638
she can't come back.

647
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,641
They won't break up.

648
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,561
He seemed like a good guy.

649
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,729
Come on, dude.

650
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,317
Hey.

651
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,485
Why did that lady visit you?

652
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,237
I don't know.

653
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,907
She left after some rambling.

654
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,744
But some of the things she said…

655
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,622
were really difficult.

656
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,134
-Let's go to sleep.
-Come on.

657
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,803
Who's going to sleep next to Jun?

658
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,725
Darn it.

659
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,270
I'm a light sleeper.

660
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:14,652
As the autumn leaves flutter

661
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:21,241
In this sorrowful wind

662
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:28,666
You must leave me behind

663
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,043
Love

664
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,505
My love

665
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,424
Before you leave

666
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,844
Tell me you love me

667
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,348
Just one more time

668
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,310
Why are you doing this?

669
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,232
He snores too much.

670
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,526
Wait.

671
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,153
Hold on.

672
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,826
No, wait. He snores too much.

673
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,213
You never told me about this.

674
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,860
Assistant Inspector Kang.

675
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,821
May I see my sister's call history?

676
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,448
Why do you ask?

677
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,742
I'd like to know who she last spoke with.

678
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,412
You saw the CCTV footage too.

679
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,999
She was in shock after that phone call

680
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,876
and walked out into the street.

681
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,130
That bothered us too,
so we did check her call history.

682
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,223
Right here.

683
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,349
Thank you.

684
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,728
Most of them were from her ex-husband.

685
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,229
The rest was spam.

686
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,447
010-1975-1225, INCOMING CALL

687
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,657
Sir, this one.

688
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,117
1225.

689
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,328
Can you tell me who this is?

690
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,705
That's the last call she received.

691
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,625
As far as we know,
it was Ms. Shin's friend.

692
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,877
It was about a favor
that Ms. Shin had asked for.

693
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,214
It was a hit-and-run,

694
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,966
so we can't bring them in.

695
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,927
I see.

696
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,473
-Thank you.
-Sure.

697
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,075
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

698
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,744
Please check your number and try again.

699
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,631
Hello?

700
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,300
Is this Mr. Shin Sung-han?

701
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,468
Who's this?

702
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,512
My name is Jin Yeong-ju.

703
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,266
I'm Seo Jeong-guk's wife.

704
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,815
I see.

705
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,443
What's this about?

706
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,197
I'd like to meet with you.

707
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,868
Is this about Gi-yeong?

708
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,869
No.

709
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,913
Actually, scratch that.

710
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,499
We need to discuss that too.

711
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,254
I don't think you have a say
in that matter.

712
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,131
Whatever it is,

713
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,883
I'll talk to Gi-yeong's dad.

714
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,136
Goodbye.

715
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,905
What's wrong with everyone?

716
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,536
It's as if I pushed her
in front of that car.

717
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,756
That careless bitch gets attention
even after she's dead.

718
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,594
I'm jealous, Shin Ju-hwa.

719
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,543
DIVORCE ATTORNEY

720
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:08,839
PREGNANCY GIFT

721
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,804
-"Pregnancy gift"?
-It's for an acquaintance.

722
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,472
A friend.

723
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,766
My friend's wife is pregnant.

724
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,186
I thought you only had two friends.

725
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,813
I'm not like Sung-han.

726
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,528
What was the best gift you got
when Hyeon-u was born?

727
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,530
Cash.

728
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,783
Do you know the gender?

729
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,076
No, not yet.

730
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,536
If it's not urgent,

731
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,456
it might be a good idea
to wait until you find out.

732
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,001
Did I tell you that I was a fan
when you were a DJ?

733
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,336
You just sounded like a DJ.

734
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,339
It's like listening to the radio.
Right, Sae-bom?

735
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,468
How about a stroller?

736
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,511
That's not so bad.

737
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,930
My older sister was thrilled
when she got one.

738
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,434
Was it because it was expensive?

739
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,229
An expensive stroller.

740
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,276
Attorney Choi, what are you doing?

741
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,446
Writing down everything I want to say.

742
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,948
-Why?
-Who do you want to say it to?

743
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,533
Attorney Shin.

744
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,787
I will no longer let him
control me with his words.

745
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,498
Perfect.

746
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,665
Is that so?

747
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,751
Try it on me first.

748
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,127
Think of it as practice.

749
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,253
Okay.

750
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,382
I, Attorney Choi Jun,

751
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,844
am a competent attorney
who graduated from SNU School of Law

752
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,221
with flying colors.

753
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,598
I proudly finished my internship

754
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,517
at Keumhwa Law Firm, the top…

755
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,397
I'm sick of spying for Keumhwa.

756
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,358
"Spying for Keumhwa"?

757
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,903
What I'm saying is that…

758
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,741
I want to focus on my work as an attorney.

759
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,451
-Liar.
-Sorry?

760
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,037
You haven't even touched
the consultation report yet.

761
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,873
I know. All he ever does is stare at me.

762
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,043
I don't stare at you. I mean…

763
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,545
You think he can handle that?

764
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:15,382
Attorney Shin wants him
to take charge this time.

765
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,008
You know,

766
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,677
I love Shin Sung-han.

767
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,016
Sure, as long as it's an easy case.

768
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,477
It's not too easy though.

769
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,870
Listen.

770
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,166
Do you also think

771
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,919
I have a problem?

772
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:56,923
No.

773
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,135
So why are you avoiding eye contact?

774
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,387
Was I?

775
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,764
You won't look me in the eye.

776
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,896
Working here…

777
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,108
you must see a lot of people…

778
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,861
who get divorced.

779
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,657
I…

780
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,659
Divorce…

781
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,831
scares me as much as marriage did.

782
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,173
Were you afraid of getting married?

783
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,804
If you want a divorce,

784
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,058
we'll help you not feel scared.

785
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,352
Once it begins,

786
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,395
it won't be as hard as you think.

787
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,439
That's how it was for me.

788
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,169
After I got married,

789
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,339
I realized that everything was a lie.

790
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,510
Everything about

791
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:25,845
my husband.

792
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,766
He deceived me perfectly in every way.

793
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,686
But he said

794
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,438
that I deceived him.

795
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,527
He says I deceived him on a deeper level.

796
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,197
He called me a fraud.

797
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,367
On what grounds?

798
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,831
I used to have…

799
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,628
a mental condition.

800
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,882
But not anymore.

801
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,531
So? She didn't recognize you
throughout the session?

802
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,615
No.

803
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,618
I don't think she knows
who Lee Seo-jin is at all.

804
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,204
See? A lot of people don't.

805
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,167
-You're not drinking the soup?
-I'm watching my figure.

806
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,589
So don't walk around all timid and scared.

807
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,966
There are a lot of good restaurants.

808
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,887
I'll forgive you even if you eat
ramyeon somewhere else.

809
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,475
Welcome.

810
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,393
Damn it.

811
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,312
Mr. Jang?

812
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,404
-Ms. Kim?
-Yes?

813
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,407
May I leave this here
until I get off work?

814
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,535
So you decided to get a stroller
for your friend's baby.

815
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,622
-The color looks sophisticated.
-Yes, it's for my friend.

816
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,168
-Right, for your friend's baby.
-Yes, for a friend.

817
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,963
Sure, you can…

818
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,424
park it over there.

819
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,760
Yes, I'll park it here.

820
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,638
Okay.

821
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,602
-Have you eaten?
-I have.

822
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,104
Put it under the painting.

823
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,398
Why did you call me here?
I quit eating carbs.

824
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,275
Flowers?

825
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,903
Hello, Mr. Crazy. Flowers?

826
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,739
Hey, this reminds me.

827
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,827
I got so much shit
for getting someone flowers the other day.

828
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,953
Mr. Shin.

829
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,497
It's bad for you
to do things that feel unnatural.

830
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,208
Remember when I opened my office?

831
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,543
-You didn't even--
-Hey.

832
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,129
What do you think he's doing?

833
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,548
And what's that dark thing next to him?

834
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,384
It's a stroller.

835
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,344
But why?

836
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,182
I'm sick of trying to guess
what's going through his mind.

837
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,477
She gave me flowers twice.

838
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,230
This is a fan's dream come true.

839
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,236
Stop it.

840
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,072
I should have just taken it to the office.

841
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,200
Yes, you could have parked it
in front of my office.

842
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,953
-It's huge.
-I mean…

843
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,330
Did you have to do this?

844
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,209
You could have gotten
something smaller and more expensive.

845
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,879
Moms apparently love strollers.

846
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,423
So you're going to meet her later
and give this to her?

847
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,343
This isn't what she wants.

848
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,928
The paperwork…

849
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,850
They both know.

850
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,310
Feel free to curse me out.

851
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,479
I mean, the stroller is great,

852
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,355
-but I--
-I filled out the divorce papers.

853
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,816
I signed them too.

854
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,152
It's a divorce gift.

855
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,115
Back off.

856
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,785
Should I come with you?

857
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,746
Why would you?

858
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,165
We've known her for so long.
We should say goodbye.

859
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,209
I don't think you should.

860
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,758
Why did you put it together yourself?

861
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,511
You could have just had it delivered.

862
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,179
I want to give it to her in person.

863
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,641
Okay.

864
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,185
Where are you meeting her?

865
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,020
Don't tell him.

866
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,230
He'll show up.

867
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,567
It's too big of a gift, right?

868
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,279
If the father doesn't like it,

869
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,781
sell it second-hand.

870
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,034
You didn't have to do this.

871
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,827
You're so naive.

872
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,164
I wanted to give you one last gift.

873
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,593
I did everything on my part.

874
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,512
I'm sure it's all ready.

875
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:20,890
Okay.

876
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,110
Ji-eun.

877
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:40,952
Ji-eun.

878
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,671
I'm sorry it took so long.

879
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,845
I wish you all the best.

880
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,224
I'm sorry.

881
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,809
Damn it.

882
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,189
It was his idea.

883
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,233
Let's have soju and beer tonight.

884
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:41,030
-Let's go to Sung-han's place.
-Yes, sure.

885
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,741
Let's drink that 30-year-old
single malt whiskey.

886
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,829
-I don't have that at home.
-Hey.

887
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,581
Stop crying and talk clearly.

888
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,459
The cabinet under the sink, right side.

889
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,381
It's in the corner behind the hose.

890
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,591
Do you also work for him as a maid?

891
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,679
-That's sesame oil.
-It's sesame oil.

892
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,389
It's not single malt whiskey.

893
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,266
-Single malt.
-Come on.

894
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,559
-It's sesame oil.
-It's okay. Don't cry.

895
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,685
All right, let's go.

896
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:13,604
Let's stop making a scene and leave.

897
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,897
It sounds so good.

898
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,108
It must be so savory.

899
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,569
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

900
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,611
Come in.

901
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,788
He had to travel quite far
and insists on seeing you today.

902
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,667
Did you give him a consultation?

903
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,254
He said he has something
to tell you in person.

904
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,131
What should I do?

905
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,803
I'll see him.

906
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,488
I've never been to Haenam.

907
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,531
It's nice there, isn't it?

908
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,536
We have the sea and the fields.

909
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,748
Right, the sea and the fields.

910
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,001
I hear you're a divorce expert.

911
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,757
Are you also an expert
at preventing a divorce?

912
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,634
Yes, I am.

913
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,511
But before we begin,

914
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:31,641
I'm sure there are
plenty of great attorneys in your area.

915
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,322
She told me to come to you.

916
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,619
KEUMHWA LAW FIRM

917
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,374
PR DIRECTOR JIN YEONG-JU

918
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,644
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

919
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:35,009
There's a fine line
between an attorney and a con artist.

920
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,969
What if you end up losing?

921
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,429
Let's look into it.

922
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:39,555
You should go.

923
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:40,890
You're obnoxious.

924
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,476
I must have made a mistake
during the consultation.

925
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,144
Move!

926
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,146
I was worried he'd miss the bait.

927
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,481
Let's begin.

928
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,982
Jin Yeong-ju.

929
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,235
She's trying to destroy Shin Sung-han.

930
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,612
I'm going to do something.

931
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,531
I'll become the talk of the town.

932
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,618
And I'll get your honor back.

933
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:04,914
