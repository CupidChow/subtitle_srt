DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,434
EPISODE 10

3
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,360
Take a seat.

4
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,281
This will take a while.

5
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,408
There's not even a nibble.

6
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,453
I don't plan on staying for long.

7
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,791
I'm bothered by Shin Sung-han.

8
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,668
There are plenty of other attorneys.

9
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,047
I can get you one.

10
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,550
I'm trying to manage on my own.

11
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,973
You must have been upset with me.

12
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,017
For all your life.

13
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,520
If I change,

14
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,980
will you forgive me?

15
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,277
You're incapable of changing.

16
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,906
Seeing that you called me
all the way out here.

17
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,867
I'm leaving.

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,287
This place smells terrible.

19
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,589
CONGLOMERATE DIVORCE SUIT BEGINS

20
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,882
TROUBLES AT CHAIRMAN'S HOME AGAIN

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,343
WILL THEY GET DIVORCED?
WILL THEIR FAMILY MATTERS BE EXPOSED?

22
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,851
SEO CHANG-JIN FACES DIVORCE
FOLLOWING HIS SON

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,274
Please include these two.

24
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,358
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,530
She can't claim that he's at fault
without any evidence.

26
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,575
-Ms. Ma has no hidden assets.
-What about Chairman Seo?

27
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,493
Neither of them has any.

28
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,580
She'll demand a division of property
as the homemaker.

29
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,166
I put together proof
of her extravagant lifestyle,

30
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,710
from her living expenses in Hawaii
to shopping sprees.

31
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,421
This won't do.

32
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,131
Let's look for more.

33
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,508
Homemaker…

34
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,513
Dude.

35
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,683
This is different
from the time we got kimchi.

36
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,520
Okay? Yours might be smaller,
but you got three and I got two.

37
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,813
This is unfair.

38
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,648
Listen.

39
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,028
This one doesn't even have legs.

40
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,280
This shouldn't count as one.

41
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,490
Look, it can't even walk.

42
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,076
No, my man. Look here.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,287
That's not what's important. Look.

44
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,247
Look at its belly.

45
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,167
Do you see that orange roe
through the shell?

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,752
This one is a male!

47
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,961
Whatever.

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,213
Do you know why this is important?

49
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,760
This determines how much rice
you can mix into the insides of the crab.

50
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,346
This is clearly not halfsies.

51
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,263
Sung-han.

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,556
What's your take?

53
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,767
Are you low on cash, Sung-han?

54
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,352
Don't you own a building?

55
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,479
And you're no better.

56
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,649
Do you have to eat that poor crab
that can't even walk?

57
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,943
What the hell are you doing?

58
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,612
Ma Geum-hui. Daenam Electronics.

59
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,031
-Shouldn't you prepare your case?
-We will.

60
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,407
After we eat the crabs.

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,329
-You idiots.
-Darn it.

62
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,373
You can have more.

63
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,378
I…

64
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,296
There isn't a lot of flesh in the claws.

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,714
Give me another part.

66
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,051
A lot of people are interested in history.

67
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,011
Yes, that's why I found…

68
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,598
But this doesn't go very well
with the show, does it?

69
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,516
Maybe not.

70
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,144
Here's the overview.
They make a lot of videos there.

71
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,063
-I like the vibe here.
-Me too.

72
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,231
This one…

73
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,732
Hyeon-u.

74
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,652
I'm so touched. You're the best.

75
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,947
Thanks.

76
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,034
What do you think?

77
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,121
-It's so well-kept.
-It's nice.

78
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,163
-Nice, right?
-Yes.

79
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,207
-Ms. Bang, take a seat.
-Okay.

80
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,627
-You look great on camera.
-You look gorgeous.

81
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,088
This feels so awkward now.

82
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,856
"Hello."

83
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,483
"It's me, Lee Seo-jin."

84
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,777
That's not it.

85
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,158
How can you be so nervous?
You're a veteran!

86
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,703
Let me use the restroom real quick.

87
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,663
I doubt there's anything left inside you.

88
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,792
Okay.

89
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,336
Here we go for real.

90
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,255
We're actually going live now.

91
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,091
One, two, three.

92
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,801
Cue.

93
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,887
Hello.

94
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,139
It's me.

95
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,267
Yes, it's Lee Seo-jin.

96
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,650
Everyone feels happiness
in different moments of life.

97
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:05,907
But at times, you find happiness
in the smallest things.

98
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,869
This story is from username SkyPostcard.

99
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:15,958
"I was never interested in
online streams."

100
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,421
"But ever since I heard
that you made a comeback online,

101
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,798
I've been an avid viewer."

102
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,965
Thank you.

103
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,136
"Other streamers often
eat or make things on their shows."

104
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,972
"But the thing about your show is,

105
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,101
it just feels like a radio show
that I can watch."

106
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,270
"I love how familiar it feels

107
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,607
and how you read stories
just like you did on the radio."

108
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,362
"I've been recommending it
to all my friends."

109
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:49,200
"DJ Jin, please let us hear
your heartwarming voice more often."

110
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,868
I'll do that.

111
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,704
Let me introduce our sponsor.

112
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,165
Grandma's Noodle Shop in Seocho-dong.

113
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,417
Thank you for your humble support.

114
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,044
-"Humble"?
-Dear subscribers.

115
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,880
Please check it out
when you're in Seocho-dong.

116
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,634
This is starting to sound
more like an advertisement.

117
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,346
Anyway, they serve amazing ramyeon.

118
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,724
Go there if you happen to be
nearby and hungry.

119
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,352
I've been there myself,

120
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,356
and it's so good that you'll end up
finishing your bowl in no time.

121
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,445
I bet many of you want to know
what exactly the place is called.

122
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,780
It's called Grandma's Noodle Shop.

123
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,491
That's what it says on the sign,

124
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,286
and all she sells is ramyeon.

125
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,705
As you probably all know,

126
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,583
those restaurants are the true gems.

127
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,086
Finish your homework
and food first, Hyeon-u.

128
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,630
Wear something pretty.

129
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,342
Like you did before.

130
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,011
Something brighter and prettier.

131
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,596
You have a lot of those.

132
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,808
My outfit is too dull, right?

133
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,102
Yes.

134
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,317
FLORAL DRESS

135
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,988
Something like this.

136
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,615
Let's see.

137
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,745
You're all grown up.

138
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,705
You're big enough to be my stylist.

139
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,834
You're all grown up, Hyeon-u.

140
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,794
I can't breathe.

141
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,006
Come on, eat your food.

142
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,760
Here's an excerpt from Affinity,

143
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,303
an essay by Pi Chun-deuk.

144
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,346
HER SMILE DISGUSTS ME

145
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,681
"There are those whom you meet once

146
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,600
and miss for the rest of your life."

147
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,144
"And there are those whom you never forget

148
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,522
yet choose not to meet again."

149
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,194
Damn it.

150
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,864
Should we catch this prick?

151
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,742
Hey, let's find this jerk.

152
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,285
What are you, a cocoon?

153
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,120
You should go to sleep just like that.

154
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,288
Mr. Jang.

155
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,207
What is it, you annoying attorney?

156
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,334
I think we should.

157
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,504
These malicious comments are
way over the line.

158
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,172
You mean LifeSucksAnyway,

159
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,550
that sly little asshole

160
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,301
who deserves to drop dead?

161
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,636
So you saw.

162
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,933
Why is it that I feel offended?

163
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,436
We can discuss that tomorrow.

164
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,272
-Good night.
-Hey.

165
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,234
I feel offended.

166
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,113
Why is that?

167
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,364
I'm offended.

168
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,077
Was he cursing me out?

169
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,082
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,919
The division of property
won't be an easy battle.

171
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,714
Have you thought about your lowest limit?

172
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,175
Are you okay?

173
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,885
Sorry?

174
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,597
Aren't you scared to go in alone?

175
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,099
You're up against six attorneys.

176
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,685
I guess six will be stronger than one.

177
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,562
Have you decided on a strategy?

178
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,356
A strategy?

179
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,572
A strategy to take on six attorneys…

180
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,950
Beethoven.

181
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,874
My strategy is

182
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,084
like Piano Concerto No. 3

183
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,297
by Beethoven.

184
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:44,977
BEETHOVEN: PIANO CONCERTO NO. 3

185
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,401
It sounds familiar.

186
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,196
There's a story behind this.

187
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,576
When this piece premiered,

188
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,287
the score was incomplete.

189
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:09,168
Back then, they had at least
two rehearsals before a concert.

190
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,713
But not only did Beethoven
leave the score incomplete,

191
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,551
but he also only had one rehearsal
at 8 a.m. on the day of the concert.

192
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,429
It gets worse.

193
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,350
The piece was supposed to be played
by the best orchestra of that time.

194
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,393
But Haydn interfered.

195
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,978
He took all the musicians away.

196
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,358
His piece, The Creation,
was performed that day as well.

197
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,194
Six against one.

198
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,823
I may not be as nervous as Beethoven,

199
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,827
but I am still quite worried and nervous.

200
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,994
However,

201
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,455
I'll do my best.

202
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,796
How did the premiere go

203
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,424
for Beethoven?

204
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,383
Well…

205
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,052
It was a great success.

206
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,471
I see.

207
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,306
About my attorneys.

208
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,934
Yes.

209
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,521
You should meet them,
buy them food and drinks,

210
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,190
and find out if they need anything.

211
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,609
And pass along my words,

212
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,280
but rephrase them first
so that they will understand.

213
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,948
Me?

214
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,621
If I really am a rotten apple,
you'll end up in bigger trouble.

215
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,792
I told you before, didn't I?

216
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,086
The thing about you is,

217
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,505
you know no shame.

218
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,886
You're a perfect fit.

219
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,351
Geum-hui will come at me
with everything that she had pent up.

220
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,103
For example,

221
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,397
my affairs.

222
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,903
You're a perfect fit
for discussing those matters

223
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,324
with the attorneys on my behalf.

224
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,915
Secondly, we're up against Shin Sung-han.

225
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,876
Have you heard the saying,

226
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,712
"Help others bargain
but break up their fights"?

227
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,591
Are you saying Shin Sung-han and I are

228
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,387
bargaining, not fighting?

229
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,598
See?

230
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,018
You catch on quick.

231
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,104
Yes.

232
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,981
You two are bargaining.

233
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,192
There will be a deal anyway.

234
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,819
But you need to get a good price.

235
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,112
That's what I want.

236
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,323
Can you do that?

237
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,993
What's in it for me, Father?

238
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,042
I'm amazed by how predictable you are.

239
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,255
What do you want?

240
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,715
The shares that will go to Gi-yeong.

241
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,592
I want them.

242
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,684
Are you asking for your share?

243
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,354
Or are you trying to tie Gi-yeong's hands?

244
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,397
It's for Ha-yul.

245
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,069
All I want to do is protect Ha-yul.

246
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,873
Then I'll give you Ha-yul's share.
How about that?

247
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,251
Thank you.

248
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,836
However,

249
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,505
what will you do if you mess up?

250
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,424
What will you put on the line?

251
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,683
Yeong-ju.

252
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,477
That's where you stand.

253
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,939
You don't have anything
to put on the line.

254
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,445
If you mess it up,

255
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,824
you'll go back to the life
that you deserve.

256
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,410
Do you understand?

257
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,995
Yes.

258
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,082
I fully

259
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,335
understand.

260
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,054
Mr. Jung, I want to get some snacks.

261
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,515
-Right now?
-I'll make it quick.

262
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,976
Please pull over.

263
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,299
DIVORCE ATTORNEY

264
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,219
Hey.

265
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,222
LifeSucksAnyway's comments got deleted.

266
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,308
I think Ms. Bang deleted them.

267
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,185
We have to catch that prick.

268
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,812
Or they'll be back again.

269
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,106
What's going on?

270
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,900
About that land in Gapyeong
owned by Daenam.

271
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,696
The land price skyrocketed
after it was included in the ITX plan.

272
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,948
So LifeSucksAnyway is related to ITX…

273
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,244
It's a secret.

274
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,913
That land is about 60,000 pyeong,

275
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,375
and it used to belong to Ms. Ma's father.

276
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,335
But Chairman Seo took it over

277
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,630
when he married Ms. Ma in his early days.

278
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,843
It was worth 130 won back in the 1980s.

279
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,469
How much would that be now?

280
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,470
Dirt cheap.

281
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,767
Shouldn't the land price alone
be considered as Ms. Ma's contribution?

282
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,478
It's not like she raised the price.

283
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,189
They just lucked out.

284
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,193
If we claim that it was her contribution,
the judge will get mad.

285
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,864
These days, the court often recognizes
contributions made by homemakers.

286
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:18,245
They must be digging up
Ms. Ma's living expenses.

287
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,956
Plus, she lives in Hawaii.

288
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,626
They'll probably try
to find fault with that.

289
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,336
She'll get something, right?

290
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,258
I don't think it'll be anywhere
close to what she wants.

291
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,470
What can I use?

292
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,972
How much does she want?

293
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,266
He couldn't pay the rent
for the land for a year.

294
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,769
My father never pressured him.

295
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,439
Chairman Seo ran the company well.
I give him that.

296
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,776
That was the reason
my father let him marry me.

297
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,403
And I'll admit.

298
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,865
I did like him back then.

299
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,452
Are you saying that the land
played a part in his success?

300
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,080
The price went up much later,

301
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,417
but without that land,
Daenam wouldn't be where it is now.

302
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,963
Wouldn't you say I've earned my share?

303
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,094
I believe I deserve 20 percent.

304
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,804
That's too much.

305
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,681
Her expectations are too high.

306
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,724
Here's the thing.

307
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,310
I'm not sure if she wants a divorce

308
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,021
or if she wants to take over the company.

309
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,023
I can't read between the lines.

310
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,194
Rich people have different standards.

311
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,785
You liked how well-lit this office is.

312
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,038
You can have it, Attorney Park.

313
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,463
I'm going to resign.

314
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,469
My mother-in-law
insists on getting a divorce,

315
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,597
so my family is in a crisis.

316
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,640
DIRECTOR JIN YEONG-JU

317
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,227
And I don't understand why I have to be
my father-in-law's spokesperson.

318
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,690
Once I'm gone,
take over this office or whatever.

319
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:16,905
I expected as much when he hired attorneys
from Jinyeong Law Firm instead of Keumhwa.

320
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,450
Anyway…

321
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,662
With his current team of attorneys,

322
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,248
those of us at Keumhwa
have become mere pawns.

323
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:33,755
And I'll have no one left
to cover for me once you retire,

324
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,051
which makes me the pawn of pawns.

325
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,638
That's not good.

326
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,102
You're being too modest.

327
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,898
I didn't cover for you.
You've made it this far on your own.

328
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,277
There's no reason for me to cover for you,

329
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,947
nor do I have the power to do so.

330
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,036
Do you really think so?

331
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,122
Chairman Seo told me

332
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,043
that this is where I stand.

333
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,005
I have to cover for myself.

334
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,842
Things are looking much worse for me.

335
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,816
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

336
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,151
Sweet ride.

337
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,655
Not as sweet as you, Ms. Bang.

338
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
Stop saying lines like that.

339
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,741
This one's no good either?

340
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,205
Wait!

341
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,834
I think it's time you brought in a guest.

342
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,837
I mean on your show.

343
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,508
That's Right, It's Lee Seo-jin.

344
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,761
Yes, It's Lee Seo-jin.

345
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,263
"Yes."

346
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,098
"Yes."

347
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,979
Yes.

348
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,690
It's you.

349
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,484
You know-it-all.

350
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,781
You're so pretty.

351
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,700
So pretty.

352
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,661
So pretty. Both you…

353
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,955
and me.

354
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,959
The response is pretty good.

355
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,130
It's all thanks to you, Ho-yeong.

356
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,218
I might quit my job and go all-in on this.

357
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,596
We got another ad. A collagen product.

358
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,723
Really?

359
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:55,480
I've been getting calls
from the celebrities we worked with.

360
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,901
I don't think the world is
all that shitty, Seo-jin.

361
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,530
They all showed support
for your online show

362
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,657
and offered to appear as guests.

363
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,457
I'm so grateful.

364
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,253
Seo-jin.

365
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,007
It's the famous autumn sky.

366
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,509
It's even in our national anthem.

367
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,388
You can look down,

368
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,890
but from time to time,

369
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,059
look up at the sky too.

370
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,205
Have you been eating well?

371
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,998
Of course.

372
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,336
At home, it's ham and instant rice.

373
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,254
When you eat out, it's ramyeon.

374
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,968
You need to eat better.

375
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,346
Or it'll catch up to you.

376
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,349
How do you know where I eat out?

377
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,227
Gi-yeong worries about you.

378
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,773
Go ahead.

379
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,108
Okay.

380
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,275
Eat up.

381
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,260
Actually,

382
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,515
I asked to meet with you
to show you something.

383
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,981
Here.

384
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,859
And…

385
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,527
this.

386
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,375
1. CHOI HYE-YEONG, MYEONGHWA UNIVERSITY
MET AT A GUEST SPEECH

387
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,128
2. YOON MI-GYEONG,
SECRETARY AT DAENAM ELECTRONICS

388
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,005
4. HWANG SUN-JEONG, ACTUARY
CHURCH IN ICHON-DONG

389
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,137
6. LEE HYEON-MI
FLORIST IN ICHON-DONG

390
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,521
They're Chairman Seo's ex-lovers.

391
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,108
I wrote down how I kept them quiet.

392
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,069
Wait, this dates back to 1994.

393
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,614
How long has this been going on?

394
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,075
I didn't put it together for my divorce.

395
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,118
Don't get the wrong idea.

396
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,747
-Then why did you…
-I gave them money

397
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,208
when they asked for it.

398
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,544
They'd call me again once they ran out.

399
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:09,049
One of them even showed up with
a miscarriage record from two years ago.

400
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,302
It was a headache.

401
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,722
Then they would demand a car, a house.

402
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,099
I once even paid for this 23-year-old's

403
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,227
studies abroad.

404
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,146
You'll find the transfer record in there.

405
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,734
I made them sign papers
saying that they'd stay away

406
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,319
and had them notarized.

407
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,532
I went through that hell for decades.

408
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,331
Could this help?

409
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,919
With this kind of information,

410
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,382
an attorney fresh out of law school
could win your case.

411
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,720
Let's go, shall we?

412
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,472
Ms. Ma.

413
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,059
Yes?

414
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,605
I have two questions.

415
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,483
Why now?

416
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,529
What's the other one?

417
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,658
Why me?

418
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,205
I put it off for too long
and grew old and afraid.

419
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,456
That's why it's now.

420
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,502
And I wanted an attorney
who's motivated to go all the way.

421
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,129
And well…

422
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,424
I thought you were my best bet.

423
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,387
What's more motivating
than personal history?

424
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,475
Please get me as much as possible.

425
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,477
I need the money.

426
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,650
Let's start at 50 percent.

427
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,490
I already feel much better.

428
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,844
Radish kimchi? Thank you.

429
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,681
It's an event reward.

430
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,933
Yes, It's Lee Seo-jin.

431
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,728
You can enter
if you like, subscribe and comment.

432
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,730
-Have you seen it?
-No.

433
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,899
It's great. Watch it.

434
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,151
You can watch it now.

435
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,820
If you leave a supportive comment,

436
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,114
the ramyeon you're eating now is
on the house.

437
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,165
You can start with a like.

438
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,792
Subscribe.

439
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,877
And comment.

440
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,720
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

441
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,805
Thank you.

442
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,650
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

443
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,694
Thanks.

444
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:22,826
Do you want to go
to the arboretum this weekend?

445
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,161
The arboretum? Sounds great.

446
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,247
Will there be traffic?

447
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,917
If there is, we can make the best of it.

448
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,585
Should we just go see a movie?

449
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,422
We already saw everything.

450
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,425
Is there something new?

451
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,135
I guess we did see everything.

452
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,639
I heard a new shopping mall just opened.
Should we go there?

453
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,267
Sure. That sounds good.

454
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,184
Okay.

455
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,397
Okay.

456
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,151
Let's just go to the orchard…
I mean, the arboretum.

457
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,945
I mean the arboretum. Yes.

458
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,493
I'd just be happy
to spend time with Hyeong-geun.

459
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,497
I don't know why he keeps
suggesting this and that.

460
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,126
I don't understand.
I don't have the energy for this.

461
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,463
It's tough to plan dates.

462
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,965
You should work out together. Go hiking.

463
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:21,885
No, too sweaty.

464
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:23,636
I'd look ugly.

465
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,223
Camping.

466
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,642
The three of them go camping often.

467
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,520
Yes, camping sounds great.

468
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,982
You can get some fresh air,
and you won't sweat.

469
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,235
Ask him.

470
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,528
I think he'll be thrilled.

471
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,654
Camping?

472
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,409
I want to go camping.

473
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,960
What are you worried about?

474
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,588
I feel too shy to camp with her.

475
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,381
Wait.

476
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,092
I'm having trouble understanding.

477
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,928
Why do you feel shy?

478
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,764
What about this makes you feel shy?

479
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,099
Camping sounds great.

480
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,353
We can grill meat, make coffee,

481
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,771
and have ramyeon too.

482
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:15,939
Not ramyeon.

483
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,106
No, not ramyeon.

484
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,691
Forget ramyeon and coffee.

485
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,903
So what about this makes you feel shy?

486
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,030
I'm not sure

487
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,575
if I should put up two tents

488
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,077
or one.

489
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,208
One.

490
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,960
-Two.
-They'll end up only using one.

491
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,920
Yes, but he should still begin with two.

492
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,088
Listen.

493
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,382
It's tough enough to put up one.

494
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,717
Why put up one more
if you're not going to use it?

495
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,053
-Tents aren't umbrellas.
-Hey.

496
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:51,015
Hyeong-geun is the gentleman type.

497
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,184
He's not like you.

498
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,394
Exactly.

499
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,731
-What am I like?
-You?

500
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,406
We have a mugshot right there.

501
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,325
This is how you look.

502
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,493
Send it to me.

503
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,370
I've decided.

504
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,372
I'll put up two.

505
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,915
And if I only need one,

506
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,334
-I'll use the other as storage.
-That's it.

507
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,338
-That's right.
-You two are ridiculous.

508
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,090
So ridiculous.

509
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,759
-I've decided.
-I get it, so drop the arm.

510
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,553
Good job.

511
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,936
So she's resigning.

512

513
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,153
racking your brain.

514
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,242
I bet your little head is…

515
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,331

Thanks, Ms. Lee.

00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,810
You work really fast.

521
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,813
About three times as fast as you.

522
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,649
Not ten?

523
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,193
Fair enough.

YOU DELETE SO MANY COMMENTS.

ARE YOU AFRAID YOUR SON WILL SEE?

HE'LL BE ASHAMED OF YOU ANYWAY.

530

WAIT UNTIL HE SEES YOUR VIDEO.

531
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,230
There must have been a lot of those.

532
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,317
Thanks for trying to delete them.

533
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,528
No, there weren't.

534
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,780
It's just this one asshole.

535
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,909
They're so persistent
that I thought, "Could it be?"

536
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,788
I thought it might be

537
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,915
Hyeon-u's dad.

538
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,298
I made a promise to myself
as I bought Hyeon-u's sneakers

539
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,633
that I'll stop hiding

540
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,969
and keep my chin up.

541
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,139
That I would toughen up
for Hyeon-u's sake.

542
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,348
As you should.

543
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,059
Should I really?

00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,185
Seo-jin.

545
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,773
If I hold my head high up,
Hyeon-u will be exposed.

546
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,942
That innocent boy will get hurt.

547
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,277
I'm going to find this prick.

548
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,738
It'll only attract attention.

549
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,824
And if you back off, will this blow over?

550
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,286
If you just lie low,

551
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,580
will Hyeon-u be safe?

552
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,471
Stop that, Seo-jin.

553
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,351
I need to see for myself.

554
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,896
I need to see who this person is.

559
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,289
About the appraisal
you ordered for Daenam.

560
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,415
Yes?

561
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,585
I put the result on your table.
Did you see it?

562
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,299
The company's too big
for an official appraisal,

563
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,802
so they made a rough estimate for now.

564
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,929
If the company is worth five trillion won

565
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,597
and Chairman Seo owns 15 percent,

566
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,558
that's 750 billion.

567
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,145
How much is 50 percent of that?

568
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,230
He won't give 50 percent
just because we ask.

569
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,065
He'll hold onto it with all he's got.

570
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,026
Are you sure you'll be okay alone?

571
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,571
I could step in and--

572
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,198
Just don't do anything.

573
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,534
Yes, sir.

574
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,786
Right.

00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,332
-Will Ms. Lee sue that person?
-She says so.

577
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,960
-She should.
-But the thing is,

578
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,588
she'd have to go to the police station.

579
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,006
Then send a warning.

580
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,425
"We'll sue you unless you apologize."

581
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,552
But we don't have their address.

582
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,016
If we file charges,
we'll be able to find the jerk.

583
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,103
But it also means
more trouble for Ms. Lee.

584
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,063
She didn't look too well.

585
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,860
But I can't tell her to ignore them
because they keep attacking Hyeon-u.

586
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,321
What if he sees them?

587
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,115
He may have seen them already.

588

That kid is mature.

589
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,412
He might have seen it
and be keeping it to himself.

Hyeong-geun needs to go home
and get some rest.

660
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,713
He's camping with So-yeon tomorrow.

661
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,174
I'm off. Bye.

662
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,634
Are you running away?

663
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,386
Good night!

664
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,346
He's running all of a sudden?

665
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,266
He has no reason to…

666
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,351
It looks fun.

667
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,312
Hyeong-geun is…

668
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,523
a really nice guy.

669
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,608
Totally.

00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,121
With this kind of information,

678
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,209
an attorney fresh out of law school
could win your case.

679
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,337
I put it off for too long
and grew old and afraid.

680
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,588
That's why it's now.

681
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,840
Please get me as much as possible.

682
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,676
I need the money.

683
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,786
It's nice to be out.

684
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,040
Let's see if you like it.
We'll do it more often if you do.

685
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,043
Some people don't like camping.

686
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,254
I know it'll be great.

687
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,006
It's my first time.

688
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,717
I'm so excited.

689
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,345
We should have invited
Sung-han and Jeong-sik.

690
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,223
With them around,

691
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,351
it wouldn't matter where we are.

692
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,686
They'd spoil the mood.

693
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:30,399
To be honest,
I thought you'd bring your friends.

694
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:35,029
They're more thoughtful than I thought.

695
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,033
Then again, they wouldn't
still be your friends if they weren't.

696
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,952
They may be immature,

697
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,122
but they aren't stupid enough
to follow us all the way here.

698
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,667
-If they were, I would have cut them out.
-I thought so.

699
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,339
I mean, they're 40, right?

700
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,299
Exactly.

701
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,846
-Should we put on some music?
-Music, cue!

702
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,515
Let's pretend the roof is open.

703
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,476
Let's say the wind is blowing in.

704
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,235
-So this is what a campfire is like.
-Don't run!

705
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,781
All done.

706
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,117
-This is so cool.
-I only brought the necessities.

707
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,788
The more experienced you are,
the lighter you pack.

708
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,457
I only pack the necessities.

709
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,084
Is this how you hold it?

710
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,798
You're good at everything.

711
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,427
Become delicious.

712
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,890
You're doing great.

713
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,434
It looks so good.

714
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,899
It's ice-cold.

715
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,568
You can drink it.

716
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,738
I'll drive later.
Chauffeur service is pricey.

717
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,328
You can have it. I'll drink fizzy water.

718
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,457
No, I can't let you drive
another two hours.

719
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,085
Come on, drink up.
Give me the fizzy water.

720
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,213
I go camping often, so you can have it.

721
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,805
No, you can have it. I'm fine.

722
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,723
Let's eat. This looks good.

723
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,976
Let's both have fizzy water.

724
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,686
-Can you see anything?
-Look.

725
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,273
He's having fizzy water.

726
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,025
It doesn't seem like
So-yeon is going to stay.

727
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,570
Sausages taste best with fizzy water.

728
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,696
S and F.

729
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,157
SF.

730
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,741
-He's insane.
-You're so funny.

731
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,201
-Like sci-fi.
-"Sci-fi."

732
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,163
Is he serious?

733
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,873
Hey, get this.

734
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,501
Why did he even worry about
how many tents to put up?

735
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,711
Tell me about it!

736
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,182
What's wrong? Do you need to poop?

737
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,183
No.

738
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,059
-I need to pee.
-What is it?

739
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,853
Cut it out. Don't do that.

740
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,273
Hey, use this.

741
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,402
That won't do.

742
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,612
I have two.

743
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,906
-Get lost.
-I think it's enough.

744
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,073
I'll kill you.

745
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,077
That's not good.

746
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,454
He got the marshmallows out.

747
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,331
That will take over an hour.

748
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,832
-Like grilling rice cakes?
-Yes.

749
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,542
-You have to turn it around.
-I see.

750
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,752
I'm losing it.

751
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,087
Why won't they go anywhere?

752
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,265
You're so good at this.

753
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,227
Why does mine keep burning?

754
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,272
You have to toast it gently
to prevent it from burning.

755
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,486
"Gently."

756
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,739
I like the sound of that word.

757
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,824
It suits you.

758
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,662
Gently.

759
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,081
Slowly.

760
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,458
Steadily.

761
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,793
Such words.

762
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,796
I'm a bit rough around the edges.

763
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,173
Rough and gentle.

764
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,385
I think that's charming.

765
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,359
Screw this.

766
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,241
Wait.

767
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,285
Isn't that Jeong-sik?

768
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,956
I was wondering why
that tent seemed empty.

769
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,917
And I knew I heard someone snickering.

770
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,464
What a coincidence.

771
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,842
It's good to see you, So-yeon…

772
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,222
Believe me.

773
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,767
It's a coincidence. I'm telling you.

774
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:20,063
Jeong-sik was whining
about how you were gone,

775
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,316
so we decided to go camping by ourselves,

776
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,526
and this was the only spot left!

777
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,488
You know we're both the cautious type,

778
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,158
so we don't like unfamiliar places.

779
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,745
And by a strange coincidence,
this spot right here

780
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,747
was the only one that was left.

781
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,751
You two are ridiculous.

782
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,502
Is this funny to you?

783
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,089
What did Jeong-sik's bladder
ever do to you?

784
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,841
Look, man.

785
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:51,345
We had 500ml water bottles.
He's just being extra.

786
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,224
Darn it.

787
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,728
It's nice to see you.

788
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,605
Very nice.

789
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,649
Same.

790
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,193
We were getting mellow over marshmallows.

791
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,907
Wow, that's a good one.

792
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,502
So-yeon, the three of us can
sleep in that tent,

793
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,795
so sleep here alone.

794
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,588
Let her decide.

795
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,548
She might feel scared to sleep alone.

796
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,800
That's right.

797
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,427
Shut up and eat your ramyeon.

798
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,264
Why would you starve
and hold in your pee for this?

799
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,393
We came to see

800
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,561
the gentle and steady Hyeong-geun.

801
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,151
I can't say anything
around these old bachelors.

802
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,492
Are you still feeling mellow?

803
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,661
Over marshmallows?

804
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,081
Get that shitty pun out of here.

805
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,333
Isn't it upsetting?

806
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,502
We usually aren't like this.

807
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,171
We need marshmallows
to camp with Jeong-sik.

808
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,465
I use them as earplugs.

809
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,343
-Marshmallow earplugs.
-He's usually funny.

810
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,970
He's being weird today.

811
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,597
I almost ran out of the tent
when I heard "sci-fi."

812
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,058
Hey, how much did you hear?

813
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,729
You have such good hearing!
How did you hear that?

814
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,939
I thought I should stop you.

815
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,150
You could hear that in your tent?

816
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,693
He's usually funny, I promise.

817
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,695
-I mean it.
-I was shocked.

818
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,406
-"SF, just like sci-fi."
-I thought it was funny.

819
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,116
I mean…

820
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,618
I think I got some noodles in my nose.

821
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,330
Oh, man.

822
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,391
Let's do this.

823
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,747
I'm not sure if this is
appropriate for the occasion,

824
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,625
but it's very nice to meet you in person.

825
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,835
I'm actually a fan of yours.

826
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,798
I've been causing some noise, haven't I?

827
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,007
Thank you.

828
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,801
You look much better in person.

829
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,302
-Really?
-Yes.

830
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,303
Thank you.

831
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,599
It's nice to break the ice
before we begin.

832
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:43,934
Right.

833
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,561
-Okay.
-Okay.

834
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,571
The defendant does not want a divorce.

835
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,616
And it's not right to say
that he's the spouse at fault.

836
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:03,328
He frequently had affairs
over a long period of time.

837
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,248
How is he not at fault?

838
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,501
Attorney Shin.

839
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,505
Do you have anything
to back up those accusations with?

840
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,508
We haven't even seen a single photo.

841
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,592
What affairs?

842
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,427
Of course there are no photos.

843
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:24,766
The plaintiff spent half her life
trying to cover up

844
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,061
all evidence of his affairs.

845
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:30,480
I already shared all of this with you.

846
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,232
I guess you didn't read it.

847
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:36,152
All you sent us was
circumstantial evidence and claims.

848
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:43,577
Would I be sitting here with you
if that was all I had?

849
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,067
1. CHOI HYE-YEONG, MYEONG-HWA UNIVERSITY

850
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,986
13. CHOI YEON-SEO,
SECRETARY AT DAENAM ELECTRONICS

851
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:24,242
If all of this can be backed up
with hard evidence,

852
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,995
the plaintiff must have planned--

853
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,957
You can't say
that she planned on getting divorced.

854
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,168
These files are like trophies.

855
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,670
And behind them is a sad story
of how the plaintiff

856
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,839
protected the defendant
and Daenam Electronics.

857
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,969
She didn't put these together
to attack her husband and his company.

858
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,140
They're the result of the plaintiff
dedicating her life to preventing

859
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:51,102
the problems that the defendant's
philandering could have caused.

860
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,187
They're…

861
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,356
her scars.

862
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,826
We'll read through the files
to verify them.

863
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,703
Yes, of course.

864
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,664
Let's talk again after that.

865
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:12,999
Sure.

866
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,393
How old are you?

867
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,061
Fourteen.

868
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,697
Why did you do it?

869
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,116
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm asking you why.

870
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,577
Hyeon-u is just a kid.

871
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,288
You're a kid too!

872
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,624
I hated you.

873
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,422
I hated your guts.

874
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,216
-All right, young lady.
-Don't talk to me like a teacher.

875
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,011
I don't even go to school.
I couldn't afford it.

876
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:51,848
Fine.

877
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,601
I understand.

878
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,810
What do you understand?

879
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,899
My mom lives a happy life
with this rich guy she ran off with,

880
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,609
while my dad got cancer and…

881
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,404
My grandma is devastated
that she lost her son,

882
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,698
but she feels too bad for me
to kill herself.

883
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,451
So what exactly do you understand?

884
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,997
Even someone like you
filed a lawsuit to keep your son.

885
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:20,460
But my mom is living in luxury

886
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,670
but doesn't give a damn
about the kid she left.

887
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,381
Damn it.

888
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,634
That's why I hated you.

889
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,678
Who do you think you are
to protect your son?

890
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,264
If even a woman like you protects her son,

891
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,058
what does that make me?

892
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,963
Are you done crying?

893
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,423
Am I going to juvie?

894
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,217
No.

895
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,761
Go home.

896
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,682
And instead of writing malicious comments,
ask for help.

897
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,935
Who would I ask?

898
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,689
Who's going to help me?

899
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,359
Good grownups.

900
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,403
Right here.

901
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,947
This man will help you.

902
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,122
You know that he's a lawyer, right?

903
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,265
Easy.

904
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,644
Too easy.

905
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,066
Come in.

906
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,490
What is it?

907
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,742
Come in.

908
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,746
Gi-yeong.

909
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,582
What are you doing here?

910
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,250
How did you get here?

911
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,170
What the…

912
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,713
Did you come alone?

913
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,839
Where's Mr. Jung?

914
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,801
I came alone.

915
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,137
How did you…

916
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,265
Have a seat.

917
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,726
Have a seat right there.

918
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,604
Do you want water, Gi-yeong?

919
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,239
Gi-yeong.

920
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,867
Did you tell your parents

921
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,119
that you were coming here?

922
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,915
I don't think you did.

923
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,172
Attorney Shin.

924
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,011
Attorney Shin Sung-han.

925
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,682
Gi-yeong.

926
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,810
Please help me too.

927
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,525
Please…

928
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,945
Please defend me too.

929
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,679
I will.

930
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,849
Uncle Sung-han will…

931
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,521
take care of everything.

932
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,798
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

933
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,161
It's not like I pushed her.

934
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,413
Did you forget?

935
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,832
We committed a crime.

936
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,668
Is Jeong-guk aware of this?

937
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,254
I have no one left on my side.

938
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,299
Even a mom like me can have my rights.

939
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,426
And you're the one who made it happen.

940
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,011
Let's look for a way.

941
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,596
I'll help out.

942
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,934
I'm finally starting
to understand the score.

943
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,769
You're right.

944
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,896
You interpreted the music perfectly.

945
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:38,528
