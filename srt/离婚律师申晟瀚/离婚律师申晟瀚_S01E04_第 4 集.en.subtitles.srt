00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,888
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,660
EPISODE 4

3
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,614
Hey.

4
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,825
Ms. Lee.

5
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,245
Why are you here so early?

6
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,666
SHIN SUNG-HAN
LAW OFFICE

7
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,170
I was just passing by.

8
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,381
And I wanted to tell you something.

9
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,301
Are you usually the first one to arrive?

10
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,636
Not really.

11
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,389
Just today.

12
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,852
You should get started with work.

13
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,523
I came to say…

14
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,944
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,363
What?

16
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,533
It felt like everyone recognized me.

17
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,494
I couldn't stop thinking about that,

18
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,330
so I couldn't get a part-time job.

19
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,334
But I still shouldn't have
shown up here with my résumé.

20
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,630
I got impatient
and I couldn't think straight.

21
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,675
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable.

22
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,095
I'm here to get my résumé back.

23
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,682
It's fine if you threw it out.

24
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,393
Your résumé is with…

25
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,687
Mr. Jang right now.

26
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,567
And I understand that you were
acting out of desperation.

27
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,569
Also,

28
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,865
I doubt that every single person

29
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,117
recognizes you.

30
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,374
About that door.

31
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,337
How did you fix it so easily that day?

32
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,714
That was really surprising.

33
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,175
I surprise myself sometimes.

34
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,676
I'm good at everything.

35
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,346
Attorney Shin really is here early.

36
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,934
He called me at 6:30 a.m.
telling me to get coffee and sandwiches.

37
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,435
He's becoming high-maintenance.

38
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,687
I mean, how is he going to live without…

39
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,945
-First day?
-Thanks for the tea.

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,366
Do you have my résumé?

41
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,202
You should stay and eat.
He got two servings.

42
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,495
Of course!

43
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,414
I knew you'd be coming,
so I bought two cups of coffee.

44
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,666
You haven't eaten, right?

45
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,709
-Their sandwiches are amazing.
-Yes, it's good.

46
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,169
No, thanks. You should have them.

47
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,212
I don't eat flour.

48
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,798
Attorney Shin, Mr. Jang.

49
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,300
What is it, Ms. Yu? Is something wrong?

50
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,763
-Is this a line?
-Yes, I've been waiting for a bit.

51
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,518
Hey, it's Lee Seo-jin.

52
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,562
-Why would she be here?
-It's her.

53
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,859
-What's going on?
-What do we do?

54
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,361
What do you mean? You're the paralegal.

55
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,113
-This is your job.
-I've never done this before.

56
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,739
-If you'll excuse me…
-Where are you going?

57
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,033
-I have a job interview.
-What job?

58
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,201
You can't…

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,662
Your clients are waiting.

60
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,833
What?

61
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,126
-What?
-What?

62
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,256
I knew you two would make a great team.

63
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,841
Please get to work right away.

64
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,844
I have an appointment with a client.

65
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,514
-I'll be going now.
-Where are you…

66
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,851
We should get to work, right?

67
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,770
Let's do this.

68
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,193
See? It is Lee Seo-jin.

69
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,821
Yes, it's me.

70
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,531
I'll be helping you.

71
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,034
Please take a seat
in the order of your arrival.

72
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,370
She's amazing.

73
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,875
SAEAN BUILDING

74
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,505
I wonder.

75
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,176
Who is this Shin Sung-han
and why is Park Yu-seok out to get him?

76
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,971
Is he a tough one?

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,848
Goodness, I'm sorry!

78
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,684
-Hurry.
-Watch where you're going!

79
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,104
Goodness, I'm sorry.

80
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,522
-One second.
-Yes?

81
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,274
Are you Mr. Shin Sung-han?

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,568
Mr. Competent, actually.

83
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,571
No way.

84
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,615
Piano Man?

85
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,952
YEONGEUN DAILY

86
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,001
Goodness, Attorney Shin.

87
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,753
Hello.

88
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,880
You must be getting a lot of business.

89
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,131
I know, it's weird.

90
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,051
I've been meaning to visit you.

91
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,135
Really?

92
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,387
I don't think we can
talk in the office right now.

93
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,015
Should we go out for a cup of tea?

94
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,934
I have to finish my work.

95
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,061
What work?
These railings are squeaky clean.

96
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,355
-Let's go get a cup of morning coffee.
-But…

97
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,773
-Come on.
-Okay.

98
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,608
All right.

99
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,696
Attorney Shin Sung-han.

100
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,783
Things just got really interesting.

101
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,080
A cleaning lady?

102
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,374
Yes, her name is Ms. Park Ae-ran.

103
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,668
-Get ready for your first case.
-Pardon?

104
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,379
You're done with your internship.
We should get you started.

105
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,547
How about a divorce case?

106
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,090
A divorce case?

107
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,925
It's nice and familiar, don't you think?

108
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,927
You can defend Park Ae-ran's husband.

109
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,056
Will I be up against
Attorney Shin Sung-han then?

110
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,642
You seem excited.

111
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,062
I should get ready.

112
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,023
But where's our client?

113
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,359
Just wait. I'll bring him to you.

114
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,529
Yes, sir. Understood.

115
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,081
Hey, I'll give you an address.

116
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,002
Find the husband of Park Ae-ran,
a cleaner of that building.

117
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,880
So?

118
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,631
Have you looked for them?

119
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,801
I did try to look for them…

120
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,804
but then…

121
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,307
Why were you in there?

122
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,269
I was trying to see
if your mother had any anxiety medication.

123
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,437
Why?

124
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,732
I couldn't sleep,
so I was wondering if she had any.

125
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,025
But you're already seeing a doctor.

126
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,990
You knew I was
getting treated for depression?

127
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,287
And you pretended not to know?

128
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,830
Go downstairs and get some rest.

129
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,125
You know what irritates me the most?

130
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,503
That mouth.

131
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,381
That mouth of yours
that has never taken my side.

132
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,050
That's what I hate the most.

133
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,718
What am I supposed to do?

134
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,303
You didn't see

135
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,223
how much Mother has suffered
since she was younger.

136
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,725
I saw everything!
I grew up seeing her suffer!

137
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,602
I'm her only child. Can't you just…

138
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,271
That old woman…

139
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,565
-She doesn't have much longer to live.
-Seo Byeong-cheol!

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,735
How old do you think I am?

141
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,781
How old do you think
your wife is right now?

142
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,785
I slave away
from morning to night at my age

143
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,870
because of my mother-in-law.

144
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,122
Can't you see that?

145
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,881
What you're looking for

146
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,551
isn't here.

147
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,928
So please.

148
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,639
Stop wasting your energy

149
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,808
and go downstairs.

150
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,116
I think he already caught on
and hid them from me.

151
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,078
How am I going to find things
that he's so determined to hide?

152
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,501
So have you had any
other issues with your husband

153
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,504
besides your mother-in-law?

154
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,550
Honestly, he's a good man.

155
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,679
That's why he remembers
all the suffering his mother went through

156
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,889
and always lets her have her way.

157
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,392
He's great to the kids too.

158
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,938
We'd have no reason to argue
if it weren't for her.

159
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,571
She's going to sue me.

160
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,240
She got a diagnosis.

161
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,161
Goodness, she's making a bold move.

162
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,914
I don't know what to do.
My heart is racing.

163
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,376
Even my depression medication
hasn't been working.

164
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,378
Depression?

165
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,297
Are you seeing a doctor?

166
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,383
Yes, for about three years now.

167
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,676
Goodness.

168
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,139
That is quite a sad
yet precious piece of information.

169
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,224
I wish you'd told me sooner.

170
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,353
Goodness. Let's see…

171
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,315
Let's see. A lawsuit…

172
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,195
We'll file a countersuit.

173
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,447
What?

174
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,534
Listen carefully, Ms. Park.

175
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,744
From this point on,

176
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,789
you really need to brace yourself.

177
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,084
You have to do exactly as I say.

178
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,794
Okay.

179
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,796
What should I do?

180
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,049
We're going to sue her for defamation.

181
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,301
I'm going to sue her?

182
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,178
Yes.

183
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,598
Can we sue her for defamation

184
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,725
-just because she insulted me?
-No.

185
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,602
Listen, Ms. Park.

186
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,147
You have never hit your mother-in-law.

187
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,190
What?

188
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,609
But my husband and kids saw--

189
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,861
No, your children weren't there.

190
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,199
Your mother-in-law couldn't
contain her anger and pushed you.

191
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,953
But she wasn't strong enough,
so she fell backward on her own.

192
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,498
But your neighbors will hear a rumor

193
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,377
that you hit your mother-in-law.

194
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,924
And we'll file a countersuit
against her for defamation.

195
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:57,842
Do you understand?

196
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,595
But that would be lying.

197
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,555
Ms. Park.

198
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,474
Think about that building.

199
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,310
Isn't your mother-in-law lying,
claiming that it's hers?

200
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,647
Right?

201
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,446
-Drink your coffee.
-Okay.

202
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,578
So I said, "Shin Sung-han was a guy
who had sung about his shin."

203
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,001
Talking shit about me again?

204
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,794
-You're back.
-Hey.

205
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,171
-What's that?
-Did you get coffee?

206
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,047
I can't drink two cups.

207
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,551
I have acid reflux.

208
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,802
I see.

209
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,387
Gosh, my esophagus.

210
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,849
So how did you handle everyone
who came this morning?

211
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,060
I put a report on your desk
with their names, contacts,

212
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,645
-and stories.
-"Stories"?

213
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,564
Come on, this isn't a radio show.

214
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,774
I mean the reasons for their visits.

215
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,652
Things feel really different today.

216
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,946
It feels like a real office.

217
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,156
Is that so?

218
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,700
Thank you for your hard work.

219
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:09,079
So why are you all gathered in my office?

220
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,414
We talked to the clients here.

221
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,832
Is that so?

222
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,667
Thank you for the useful information.

223
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,294
Could you please get lost?

224
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,338
You punk. We've done so much today.

225
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,464
Sae-bom.

226
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,718
I told you I quit.

227
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,516
Should I go home now

228
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,934
or will I get more training?

229
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,689
Have you had lunch?

230
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,868
Well…

231
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,038
Rather than sitting across
from each other,

232
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,042
this kind of layout is a little more…

233
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,252
Right?

234
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,754
I agree with you.

235
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,765
If you're doing this to make sure I eat,

236
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,600
thanks.

237
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,188
No, I'm just sharing
information on good restaurants.

238
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,274
It's important in Seocho-dong.

239
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,568
This ramyeon place has tradition.

240
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,320
She's the second owner.

241
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,447
She claims to be the original one,

242
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,951
but we'll need to fact-check that
once the first owner gets here.

243
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,835
I didn't put eggs in it.

244
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,837
I heard you like your ramyeon clean.

245
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,505
Okay.

246
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,844
You know…

247
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,096
I'm a fan.

248
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,224
Thank you.

249
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,604
You know,

250
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,647
I'm going to turn this place
into a macaron shop.

251
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,149
Please come by once I do.

252
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,860
If you give me an autograph,
I'll frame it.

253
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,822
I don't think this shop
goes well with macarons.

254
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,740
Right?

255
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,366
Thank you for the food.

256
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,749
Don't give her one for her macaron shop.

257
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,292
Okay?

258
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,837
She should keep this recipe alive
in the spirit of artisanship.

259
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,844
Great noodles, right?

260
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,350
And this sound.

261
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,527
There's a pork cutlet place back there.

262
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,322
It's another great place.

263
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,616
They use fresh oil.

264
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,285
Once you start working with us,
try that place too.

265
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,495
It's great.

266
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,377
Guess I'll be seeing you around.

267
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,713
Mom said this place was a prime location.

268
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,798
She was right.

269
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,052
Please leave an autograph.

270
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,765
Not for macarons. Don't do it.

271
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:30,155
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

272
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,629
Gosh, this weather.

273
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,649
Jo Jeong-sik, you prick!
Drink after we're done setting up!

274
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,485
You better only drink your portion.

275
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,780
I don't care if you run out later.
Four cans are mine.

276
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,116
I've been running around
while you guys are sitting.

277
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm thirsty.

278
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,669
Your office seemed busy.

279
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,338
It was so hectic.

280
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,882
If it hadn't been for Seo-jin…

281
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,217
Seo-jin? Lee Seo-jin?

282
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,176
She works with us.

283
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,469
No way.

284
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,472
Hey, I'm taking one of your monitors.

285
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,100
Dude, just buy one.

286
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,518
I got mine second-hand.

287
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,895
-Aren't you a VIP on that marketplace app?
-Hyeong-geun is.

288
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,980
I'm the one who buys supplies.

289
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,148
How is it that

290
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,652
I have more staff than clients?

291
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,278
Hey.

292
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,322
Did you not see all the new clients today?

293
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,326
That's meaningless.
I can't possibly take on all those cases.

294
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,079
Hey, you should redecorate your office.

295
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,373
I mean, you got a new staff member.

296
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,916
Redecorate, my ass.

297
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,002
He only buys used goods
because he doesn't know when he'll quit.

298
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,088
-He's so cheap.
-Stingy bastard.

299
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,590
-In my dream,
-You did that in your dream too?

300
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,717
I saw Ju-hwa.

301
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,660
Thanks for coming.

302
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,454
I'll call you. Bye.

303
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,027
Where's Gi-yeong?

304
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,405
He's too young.

305
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,868
But this is…

306
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,623
His mother is…

307
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,043
His mom is…

308
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,003
Sung-han.

309
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,671
It's tough for us too.

310
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,270
-Get out.
-Sung-han.

311
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,356
And stop calling my name, you asshole!

312
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,966
Are you all right, Sung-han?

313
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,095
Let's sit you down somewhere.

314
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,308
He's supposed to be here as family.

315
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,813
But he just came as a guest.

316
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,374
My poor Ju-hwa…

317
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,402
Come on.

318
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,749
Damn it.

319
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,423
No wonder he's
always tired during the day.

320
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,216
He can't focus.

321
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,439
Hey, did you meet…

322
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,942
Ji-eun?

323
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,153
Yes.

324
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,405
What did she say?

325
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,825
Just the usual.

326
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,829
Let's go to sleep.

327
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,751
Okay, let's go to sleep.

328
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,338
-By the way…
-Yes?

329
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,924
Why do we suddenly have so many clients?

330
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,509
Beats me.

331
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,433
Hello.

332
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,519
Mr. Seo Byeong-cheol?

333
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,983
Here.

334
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,569
KEUMHWA LAW FIRM
ATTORNEY PARK YU-SEOK

335
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,617
Those of us at Keumhwa would
like to help you with your divorce suit.

336
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,910
Keumhwa?

337
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,578
Yes, Keumhwa Law Firm.

338
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,373
We're one of the most famous law firms.

339
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,333
We are the ones

340
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,877
who were behind
Assemblyman Kim Jin-guk's acquittal.

341
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,045
Do you know that case?

342
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,547
Yes.

343
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,173
Not a good law firm then.

344
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,884
Also,

345
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,054
I don't want a divorce.

346
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,013
Goodness, Mr. Seo.

347
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,976
Your wife is seeing
her attorney every day to prepare.

348
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,102
Didn't you know?

349
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,480
If she has an attorney,

350
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,566
you won't be able
to handle the suit alone.

351
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,278
All divorces are like that.

352
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,488
You lose everything
if you're not prepared.

353
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,991
How do you know me?

354
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,244
No, how did you know
what's happening in my family?

355
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,080
My sister-in-law lives
in your neighborhood.

356
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,583
The whole town knows about it.

357
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,961
Our law firm has a rule

358
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,715
that a new lawyer must
take up their first case pro bono.

359
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,218
We wondered who we should help this time.

360
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,221
Then I heard my sister-in-law
and thought, "This is it."

361
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,892
Let us help you. Free of charge.

362
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,741
We're going to sue her for defamation.

363
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,245
Listen, Ms. Park.

364
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,415
You have never hit your mother-in-law.

365
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,344
I know you never went to college,

366
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,846
but didn't your mother teach you anything?

367
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,640
You got pregnant before marriage.

368
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,351
You don't do a thing at home.

369
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,894
Use cloth diapers.

370
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,520
How dare you waste money on these?

371
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,731
Your husband is out there slaving away!

372
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,325
Where are you going?

373
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,204
Byeong-cheol and I are going on a trip

374
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,498
with his college friends
and their spouses.

375
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,250
We told you before.

376
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,669
Yes, you said you're going to Jeju Island.

377
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,463
I'm very envious of your life.

378
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,716
I broke my back to raise him,

379
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,969
but you're the one
who gets all the nice things.

380
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,346
This world is just unfair.

381
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,157
Hey, honey.

382
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,661
I don't think I can go.

383
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,204
It's not that.

384
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,081
I'm not feeling too well.

385
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,959
I think my vertigo is back.

386
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,046
I'm too dizzy to get on a plane.

387
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,173
Bye.

388
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,510
I heard you're seeing a divorce attorney.

389
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,887
Is this true?

390
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,139
Do you think I'll just sit back
and do nothing?

391
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,267
I met with an attorney
from Keumhwa Law Firm today.

392
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,895
Do you have any idea how famous they are?

393
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,815
Don't think about taking this to court.

394
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,817
Let's stop here.

395
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,903
Good for you. I hope you come prepared.

396
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,613
I can't believe you!

397
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,408
Do you think you could win
after you hit your mother-in-law?

398
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,827
When did I ever hit your mother?

399
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,164
I did hear that false rumor going around.

400
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,333
I'm going to sue her.

401
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,502
I'm going to sue her for defamation.

402
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,419
Park Ae-ran!

403
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,963
She's accusing me
when she fell on her own.

404
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,465
She thinks I'm a doormat

405
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,592
and that I have no honor to defend,

406
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,636
but I'm going to sue her.

407
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,846
I never hit her!

408
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,478
Where's Gi-yeong?

409
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,730
He's not feeling well.

410
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,857
I'm making porridge.

411
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,150
Shouldn't he see a doctor?

412
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,361
Gi-yeong cried.

413
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,155
Ha-yul, let's eat.

414
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,073
Okay.

415
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,200
What's wrong?

416
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,119
I'm not sure.

417
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,871
-A fight with a friend?
-Does he have one?

418
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,625
It's still morning, honey.

419
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,710
I'll explain later.

420
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,295
You'll be late for work.

421
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,591
Mom.

422
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,636
Why can't Gi-yeong meet Uncle Sung-han?

423
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,146
Ha-yul, can you eat more?

424
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,689
I don't want to.

425
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,566
Then brush your teeth and get ready.

426
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,734
Okay.

427
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,544
Honey.

428
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,297
Here's how I feel.

429
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,216
I think our immediate family
is the most important thing.

430
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,428
Gi-yeong, Ha-yul, you, and me.

431
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,055
The four of us matter the most.

432
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,310
With Ha-yul growing up,
I don't think we need the confusion

433
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,688
caused by keeping that man in our lives.

434
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,025
Gi-yeong is still young.
Is this necessary?

435
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,985
To be honest, it's very tough for me.

436
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,821
It feels like I'm living with his mom.

437
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,533
It feels like there are
five of us, not four.

438
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,955
She's dead. Why are you so concerned?

439
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,877
You know that I made sure
you got Gi-yeong's custody

440
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,215
because I wanted to make a perfect family.

441
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,760
If he lived with his mom,
I knew I couldn't bear

442
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,512
seeing you looking after them.

443
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,764
So what is this?

444
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,974
Why does his uncle…

445
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,436
Why does his uncle have to
come between us?

446
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,609
Let him go this month.

447
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,528
Let him say goodbye.

448
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,367
Thank you, honey.

449
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,744
For understanding me.

450
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,921
Go meet your uncle.

451
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,090
I can go?

452
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,050
Go on.

453
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,662
-Hello?
-Uncle Sung-han!

454
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,747
Hey, Gi-yeong!

455
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,251
You sound so happy.
What are you so excited about?

456
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,670
I can go to your place next week.

457
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,383
Sounds great!

458
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,802
Let's have a blast, okay?

459
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,388
Okay. I'll see you then. Bye!

460
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,806
Okay, bye!

461
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,766
Oh, yeah.

462
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,393
Come on, man!

463
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,942
ATTORNEY SHIN SUNG-HAN

464
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,124
Hey.

465
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,335
Go back to your desk, man.

466
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,924
I'm too shy.

467
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,966
Why?

468
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,930
-No.
-Come on.

469
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,515
-Leave me alone. I'm busy.
-I need to talk to you.

470
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,559
You lunatic.

471
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,026
My desk…

472
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,194
Yes?

473
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,615
It's right across from Ms. Lee's.

474
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,077
I feel shy.

475
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,162
Hyeong-geun.

476
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,205
Yes?

477
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,873
Get lost.

478
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,255
You idiot.

479
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,094
The views just keep going up.

480
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,888
When will I get to see

481
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,266
Shin Sung-han, the pianist's
inspired performance

482
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,478
with my own two eyes?

483
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,648
You pricks.

484
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,942
I shouldn't even call you two my friends.

485
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,236
You're unbelievable.

486
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,447
How can you tease me over this?

487
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,075
You already know how I've lived

488
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,786
and the reason

489
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,164
why I gave up on playing the piano!

490
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,710
What's wrong?

491
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,337
Are you crying?

492
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,922
Are you?

493
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,676
It didn't hit you.

494
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,431
I threw it to your left to avoid
hitting you. To my one o'clock.

495
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,435
And even if I did hit you,

496
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,769
you punk.

497
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,398
Even if you were hit
in your face like this,

498
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,442
it's nothing to cry about.

499
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,571
There's no reason

500
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,323
to get all teary like that.

501
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,200
Hyeong-geun. Hey.

502
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,453
Jang Hyeong-geun.

503
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,872
Jang…

504
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,915
Wait.

505
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,208
Mr. Jang.

506
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,544
Mr. Jang? What's wrong?

507
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,754
Did you make him cry?

508
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,547
-I didn't.
-But he's crying.

509
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,216
That's the reason I'm asking him.

510
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,177
Attorney Shin.

511
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,305
-Yes?
-Do you have a minute?

512
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,848
I didn't make him cry!

513
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,308
I get that.

514
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,160
JI-EUN

515
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,245
I couldn't say this last time we met.

516
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,289
I'm pregnant.

517
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,667
Let's put an end to this.

518
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,586
Please.

519
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,775
So…

520
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:15,363
I think we could use
a separate consultation room.

521
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,073
A consultation room?

522
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,952
Isn't my office enough?

523
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,537
You saw the list, right?

524
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,833
It might be too much for you to handle,
so I gave it some thought.

525
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,211
I thought I could talk to them
before they see you.

526
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,340
You'll talk to them yourself?

527
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,176
It'd be easier for them
to talk to me than to you.

528
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,180
"Compared to Lee Seo-jin,
my situation isn't that bad."

529
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,349
I think it's a good strategy.

530
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,475
It's not.

531
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,522
Let's forget the consultation room then.

532
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,483
I'll just talk to them here.

533
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,026
Will you give us privacy?

534
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,282
I'll consider having…

535
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,994
a consultation room.

536
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,915
Are you planning to hire new lawyers
with all these cases--

537
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,208
No, not at all.

538
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,507
All right.

539
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,552
Attorney Park gave me
a short overview of your case.

540
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,846
Will you be getting a divorce?

541
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,515
Well, yes.

542
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,935
She wants a division of property
on the building.

543
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,271
-Is that right?
-More importantly,

544
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,609
she wants to sue my mother for defamation.

545
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,653
What does she mean by defamation?

546
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,114
She claims she never hit my mother

547
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,744
and the neighbors are pointing
their fingers at her for no reason.

548
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,122
Man.

549
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,625
Piano Man has an awesome strategy.

550
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:56,172
Please talk to your wife again
about the defamation charges.

551
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,424
She could have said it out of anger.

552
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,511
I'll schedule a mediation session then.

553
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,264
"Defamation"?

554
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,852
-It was good, right?
-Thank you.

555
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,479
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

556
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,818
Hey.

557
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,279
Do you want ramyeon?

558
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,866
-Yes.
-Without eggs?

559
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,117
Yes.

560
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,787
-Do you have hot chilies?
-Yes.

561
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,038
I want extra.

562
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,493
Thank you.

563
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,059
Excuse me.

564
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,814
Your mother used to sell
leftover soju by the glass.

565
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,940
Do you have any?

566
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,400
No.

567
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,652
I see.

568
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,837
I drink wine.

569
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,802
5,000 won per glass.

570
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,804
Is that too much?

571
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,848
This is good wine.

572
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,406
I'll take it.

573
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,495
Thank you.

574
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,150
Excuse me.

575
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,613
Four glasses of wine
and a bowl of ramyeon.

576
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,198
So 5 times 4, plus 3,500.

577
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,533
That's 23,500 won, right?

578
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,326
The ramyeon is on the house.

579
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,036
Thank you.

580
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,223
Ramyeon and wine.

581
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,227
Not bad.

582
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,980
Have you tried it?

583
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,898
Have you tried ramyeon with wine?

584
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,901
Have you?

585
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,113
WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING
IS EXTREMELY PRECIOUS

586
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,323
AIM FOR THE MIDDLE
AND DON'T SPILL ANYTHING

587
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,999
Forget the lawsuit.

588
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,625
Get a grip!

589
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,295
I did get a grip.

590
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,006
So don't worry about me
and be ready to be served.

591
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,924
Aren't you ashamed to see the kids?

592
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,343
I've been ashamed to see them until now.

593
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,804
-Not anymore.
-Are you really the Ae-ran I know?

594
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,265
Have you always been this brazen?

595
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,353
Get out.

596
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,563
I'm working.

597
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,565
After what you did to Mother,

598
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,859
-what is this nonsense?
-Hello.

599
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,694
-Goodness.
-Hello.

600
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,737
Hello.

601
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,614
Ms. Park, I'll file your lawsuit today.

602
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,616
Okay.

603
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:37,286
How could an attorney
encourage her to lie?

604
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,329
"Lie"?

605
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,248
No, I believe my client's words.

606
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,833
I didn't know you were like this.

607
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,211
I've trusted you all these years!

608
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,174
To think that I felt sorry for you

609
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,551
and never once raised my voice!

610
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,386
This isn't fair.

611
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,097
My life is unfair.

612
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,478
Ms. Park.

613
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,150
Does it feel unfair?

614
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,449
Is it devastating to know
that your wife is lying

615
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,368
when you've trusted her all your life?

616
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,994
Do you have to ask?

617
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,371
Well,

618
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,873
how do you think Ms. Park feels?

619
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,210
She's been mistreated
and psychologically abused

620
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,878
by her mother-in-law her whole life,

621
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,548
with only her husband to trust.

622
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,884
But now you're lying
that the building you two bought together

623
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,136
belongs to your mother.

624
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,180
So how do you think Ms. Park feels?

625
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,183
I've only heard
her side of the story, but…

626
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,268
So?

627
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,397
That's why she's
screwing me over like this?

628
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,691
No, screwing you over?

629
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,152
Ms. Park has never hit your mother,
so she's claiming so.

630
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,572
And she's filing defamation charges

631
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,866
to defend the honor
of her tough yet diligent life.

632
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,870
You're a lawyer, so you'd know.

633
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,415
You know Keumhwa Law Firm, don't you?

634
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,334
I'm preparing my case with them,

635
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,586
so good luck.

636
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,675
Keumhwa?

637
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,762
Why is he coming after me already?

638
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,184
Damn it. My stomach hurts.

639
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,730
Come on.

640
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,274
Damn it.

641
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,659
No!

642
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,119
Hello?

643
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,288
Hello? Hyeong-geun.

644
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,623
Hyeong-geun, where are you?

645
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,915
Outside?

646
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,126
There's no toilet paper in here.
Bring me some.

647
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,003
You can't?

648
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,464
I can't have Sae-bom come here!
It's embarrassing.

649
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,257
Fine, I'm hanging up.

650
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,265
Why did you cry?

651
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,017
Hey.

652
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,269
And who did you drink with?

653
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,104
Alone?

654
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,523
Hey.

655
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:19,907
Damn it.

656
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,576
Why did you tell me to come over so late?

657
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,620
Your place is so much closer.

658
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,289
Why did you call him?

659
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,667
He looks fine. Why are you so worried?

660
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,544
You think he looks fine right now?

661
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,671
He cried.

662
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,506
What?

663
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,965
Look at you.

664
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,343
Why, you…

665
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,346
You can't hit his face
just because he teased you a little!

666
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,766
I wouldn't be this frustrated if I did.

667
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,810
You know that cushion in my office, right?

668
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,353
The light and comfy one.

669
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,313
-I just--
-You threw that at his face?

670
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,817
Do you know how humiliating that is?

671
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,152
It's not his face that hurts,
but his heart,

672
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,612
you stupid lawyer.

673
00:44:58,695 --> 00:44:59,863
It didn't even hit him.

674
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,490
Then why the hell is he crying?

675
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,075
That's what I'm saying!

676
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,083
I'm pregnant.

677
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,253
Let's put an end to this.

678
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,462
Please.

679
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,721
So this child isn't yours.

680
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,475
And it'd be weird for you to raise it.

681
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,853
Do you see why I cried now?

682
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,857
You can leave now.

683
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,694
Good grief.

684
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,780
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

685
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,782
I feel dizzy when I get up these days.

686
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,992
Take a seat.

687
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,707
I should sleep over.

688
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,792
Me too. I'll sleep over too.

689
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,420
I'm suddenly sleepy.

690
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,214
Okay, you can sleep over.

691
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,843
-I'll leave.
-Okay, we'll leave.

692
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,178
We're leaving.

693
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,305
Go to your room and sleep.

694
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,474
Don't drink again, okay?

695
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,982
Throw on a blanket.

696
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,403
Think happy thoughts.

697
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,760
It's nice to be home.

698
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,303
Yes.

699
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,930
Lie down…

700
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,098
and get some sleep.

701
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,683
Okay.

702
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,894
Is Ae-ran set on getting a divorce?

703
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,522
Go to sleep.

704
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,814
It's for the better.

705
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,233
She's good for nothing.

706
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,527
You'll find a ton of women out there.

707
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,195
They'll all be better than her.

708
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,906
Do you want water?

709
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,450
You better get your head straight.

710
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,494
We're not giving her any money.

711
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,662
She's the only reason

712
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:15,791
that you couldn't marry
that vice principal's daughter.

713
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,418
She was a teacher, she was pretty…

714
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,797
My heart breaks
whenever I think about that.

715
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,801
It's all in the past.
Why brood over it all your life?

716
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,678
How can I not?

717
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,972
I always feel furious
whenever I see that dimwit.

718
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,310
Goodness.

719
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,479
She'll be the death of me.

720
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,588
Mom.

721
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,507
Grandma got discharged.

722
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,217
I know.

723
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,343
Go get some rest.

724
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,679
I'll take care of everything.

725
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:58,560
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

726
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,899
Attorney Shin Sung-han?

727
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,567
Yes?

728
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,153
Nice to meet you.

729
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,364
I'm Choi Jun from Keumhwa Law Firm.

730
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,366
I see.

731
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,660
This is my first case,

732
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,205
and I'm excited to be up against you.

733
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,749
I just finished my internship.

734
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,960
I was expecting Attorney Park.

735
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,089
He said a rookie could
handle an easy case like this.

736
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,800
An easy case?

737
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,260
Attorney Shin.

738
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,513
You're so cool.

739
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,102
You packaged this as a defamation case.

740
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,771
-I'm in awe.
-Go on in.

741
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,232
But I still think we'll win.

742
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,360
Then I'll see you inside.

743
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,574
What an oddball.

744
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,410
Attorney Shin.

745
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,994
Hello, Ms. Park.

746
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,413
You're here.

747
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,706
You seem nervous.

748
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,333
Don't be. I'll do all the talking.

749
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,292
Don't worry.

750
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,836
Let's go.

751
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,778
As you can see in the financial documents,

752
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,198
when the building was bought
on September 21, 2010,

753
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,034
the defendant was the one
who made the down payment.

754
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,746
It was also he who paid
the installment a month later

755
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,039
as well as the last bit of balance.

756
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,251
Therefore, the building
actually belongs to the defendant.

757
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,713
When his business was struggling,
he wanted to protect his assets.

758
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,715
He transferred the title

759
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,967
to his mother, Ms. Park Eul-bun,

760
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,677
without discussing it with the plaintiff.

761
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,597
Hence, we request a share of the property.

762
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,434
That building was
the defendant's gift to his mother.

763
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,811
It's no longer his building.

764
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,231
And of course, it is registered
under Ms. Park Eul-bun's name.

765
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,608
A gift?

766
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,236
His family didn't have a place to live,

767
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,156
but he gave a building
to his mother as a gift?

768
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,532
Yes, he did.

769
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,742
How can he do that?

770
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,286
The defendant's business began to struggle

771
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,205
five years prior to the title change.

772
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:26,291
Which means he has had zero income

773
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,293
since then and to this day,

774
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,504
for eight years.

775
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,341
Then who do you think has been
making a living for this family?

776
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,426
That's right, it's the plaintiff.

777
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,595
She makes gimbap early in the morning,

778
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,472
cleans a building all afternoon,

779
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,557
then works as a server on weekends.

780
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,185
The plaintiff has been
the only person in her family

781
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,562
who makes any money at all.

782
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,440
The claim that he gave away
the building protected by her sacrifices

783
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,651
is just unacceptable.

784
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:57,155
We do feel deep remorse
about these circumstances.

785
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,951
The defendant has also been
trying hard to find a job.

786
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:05,789
However, he witnessed
his mother getting beaten by his wife.

787
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,250
He has been receiving
psychotherapy since then.

788
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,336
It's such a shame
that despite all of this,

789
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,047
instead of regretting her actions,
she's only interested

790
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,591
in the division of property.

791
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,426
The plaintiff has received treatment

792
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,847
for depression and panic disorder
for over three years.

793
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,558
The defendant knew of her condition

794
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,601
yet continued to stay indifferent.

795
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,563
I cannot help but say
this is a great shame.

796
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,941
Please check the medical certificate

797
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,527
to see the cause of her severe depression.

798
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,280
MEDIATORS

799
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,417
I…

800
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,088
hit my mother-in-law.

801
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,595
-As her attorney--
-I…

802
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,848
lied to my lawyer.

803
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,184
I've been angry all my life

804
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,604
and I ended up doing that.

805
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,439
I'm sorry.

806
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,901
But I still…

807
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,778
want my share…

808
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,408
of that building.

809
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,787
The title was transferred
without my knowledge--

810
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,872
I'm sorry,

811
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:32,000
but he didn't need consent
as the building was under his name.

812
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,503
Mediators, may I ask Mr. Seo a question?

813
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,421
Sure.

814
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,422
Mr. Seo.

815
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,927
Do you really think
that building only belongs to you?

816
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,889
Do you not recall
the conversation you had with her?

817
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,266
You told her

818
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,226
you had temporarily transferred the title

819
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,479
because your business
was facing difficulties.

820
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,105
Do you not recall saying that?

821
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,315
Don't answer that.

822
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,441
Mediators.

823
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,944
-In the document we submitted--
-Wait.

824
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,283
Here.

825
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,247
Please listen to it.

826
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:12,958
What is it?

827
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,210
You'll know when you hear it.

828
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,631
Mr. Seo, you should have
discussed this with me first.

829
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,549
Mediators.

830
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,343
We have not discussed this evidence.

831
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,844
Please give us time to talk.

832
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,054
Well…

833
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:30,350
Why don't you respect
your client's decision,

834
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,393
Attorney Choi?

835
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:43,071
The building at 122 Hwagok-dong is

836
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,824
under Park Eul-bun's name.

837
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:51,287
But it originally belongs to my son,
Seo Byeong-cheol.

838
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,541
I am keeping it under my name for now,

839
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,085
but it is Seo Byeong-cheol's building.

840
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,753
Is that good? It's good, right?

841
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,969
This is…

842
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,723
a notarized transcript of this recording.

843
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,363
You must be worn out.

844
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,241
You've been through so much.

845
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:58,354
When you said we should say
that I didn't hit her,

846
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,273
I didn't know why.

847
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,567
Were you flustered?

848
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,113
I still had no idea when you asked

849
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,158
if my husband was a good man
apart from my mother-in-law.

850
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,493
Forget the lawsuit.

851
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,745
Get a grip!

852
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,789
I did get a grip.

853
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,792
So don't worry about me
and be ready to be served.

854
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,335
Aren't you ashamed to see the kids?

855
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,963
I've been ashamed to see them until now.

856
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,131
Not anymore.

857
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,883
Are you really the Ae-ran I know?

858
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,177
Have you always been this brazen?

859
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,022
I still saw some romance between you.

860
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,483
"Romance"?

861
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:48,154
There was a musician named Schumann.
His wife was named Clara.

862
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,449
Schumann wrote Three Romances

863
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,493
and gave it to Clara as a gift.

864
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,286
And then Clara…

865
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,206
Well, anyway…

866
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,792
In short,

867
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,212
I put my trust in your husband today.

868
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,798
I left it up to his sincerity.

869
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,136
-I don't think it was a good defense.
-Don't say that.

870
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,223
You helped me see
my husband's true feelings.

871
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,474
It was a great defense.

872
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,185
You did well.

873
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:21,729
Thank you.

874
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,664
Why would you give her
a share of the building?

875
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,207
She's done nothing for it!

876
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,668
All she ever did was ruin your life!

877
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,212
She didn't ruin my life.

878
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,089
-Stop that.
-Of course she did.

879
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,675
If it weren't for her,
the vice principal's daughter--

880
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,843
His daughter said…

881
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,098
She said she wouldn't marry me.

882
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,184
What?

883
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,227
When I told her
I wanted you to live with us,

884
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,813
she didn't want to marry me.

885
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,649
She said we should find you a home

886
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,152
so we could live with her family

887
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,279
because she was an only child.

888
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,283
-Goodness.
-So we had broken up long ago,

889
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,202
then I began to drink my life away.

890
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,871
Back then,

891
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:25,126
Ae-ran was the employee
who made me hangover soup every morning.

892
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,670
She didn't get pregnant by chance.

893
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,799
I had serious feelings for her
for a very long time.

894
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,138
Why did you let me be your burden?

895
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,767
Why couldn't you marry into that family?

896
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,769
I meant everything to you!

897
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,522
I couldn't do that.

898
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,148
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

899
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,484
Why are you telling me this now?

900
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:53,029
I didn't want to break your heart.

901
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,991
Goodness.

902
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,161
Goodness.

903
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,456
How did you figure out Ms. Park's husband?

904
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,959
That they still had romance?

905
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,379
One of the Three Romances
by Schumann is titled,

906
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,506
"Simple, heartfelt."

907
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:15,635
When they began to scream at each other
at the top of their lungs…

908
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,096
How can I put this? I kept hearing…

909
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,682
the romance in the background.

910
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,186
Where are you parked?

911
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,479
In the public parking lot.

912
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,773
Just register your car
for parking at the office.

913
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,860
You'd have to rush to pick up
Hyeon-u from the academy on time.

914
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,792
CUT YA HAIR

915
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,086
Come and eat.

916
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,213
What are you doing?

917
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,174
I'm going downstairs right away.

918
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,052
You should eat.
You only had hospital food.

919
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,409
I'm sorry.

920
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,289
Please forgive me.

921
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,836
I was insane.

922
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,090
I was out of my mind.

923
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:39,802
Get up.

924
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,514
I deserve to die.

925
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,476
I said, get up.

926
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,902
I'll send Byeong-cheol downstairs.

927
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,238
Cook him a warm meal.

928
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,623
You don't want to?

929
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,834
Will you divorce him?

930
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,421
I don't have the right to do that.

931
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,550
Thanks to you,

932
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,178
all these years,

933
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,933
I had the luxury of growing old
with warm food and housing.

934
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,313
If it hadn't been
for a slow girl like you,

935
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,859
I'd be in a nursing home by now.

936
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,587
It's delicious.

937
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,300
Thank you.

938
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,361
LAWYER PARK YU-SEOK

939
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,321
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

940
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,660
Embarrassed to lose your first case?

941
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,122
I didn't lose.

942
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,458
They withdrew the suit, so it was a tie.

943
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,542
Then why?

944
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,296
There's another place I want to work at.

945
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,177
Are you sulking about
getting a divorce suit

946
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,262
as your first case?

947
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,974
I want to be an expert in divorce suits.

948
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,227
Thank you for everything!

949
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,156
What's wrong with him?

950
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:12,914
Damn it.

951
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:20,588
Professor Choi and I have
lived together for over three years.

952
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,300
You already know. This is meaningless.

953
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,136
Please divorce him.

954
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,596
Go ahead and live that way.

955
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,474
It's not so bad for me.

956
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:35,061
There's no use
in getting jealous at this age.

957
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,313
We can both live at ease,
just as we are now.

958
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,856
This is ridiculous.

959
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,401
If you don't divorce him, a man will die.

960
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,820
He'll die.

961
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,156
No matter how much you hate him,
he is your son's father.

962
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,245
I'd rather be widowed than divorced.

963
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,460
You can have my drink.

964
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,226
CAUTION, WET PAINT

965
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,353
This way, please.

966
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,355
You got this!

967
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,401
No, not there.

968
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,028
Thank you.

969
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,910
An expansion?

970
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,163
So much pressure already.

971
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,185
Those must be the grapes

972
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,313
that he wanted to ruin.

973
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,357
So why are you here?

974
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,984
I hear you're looking for lawyers.

975
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,153
We are? No way.

976
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,738
But you put up a job ad…

977
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,157
I guess you didn't know.

978
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:16,829
I mean, we don't need two lawyers here.

979
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,082
Last time I was here, it looked like
you were getting a lot of clients

980
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,418
-after you won Lee Seo-jin's case.
-No.

981
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,503
We don't handle that many cases.

982
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:28,215
I tend to put maximum effort
into every single case.

983
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,385
And another important personal note.

984
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:36,849
I don't want to work with a lawyer
who was with Keumhwa before.

985
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,976
Keumhwa is a large firm, right?

986
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:41,979
I learned a lot there.

987
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,899
Exactly. You learned a lot there.

988
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,985
So you should keep climbing
the ladder within Keumhwa.

989
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,195
But I like it here.

990
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,240
Listen.

991
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:54,700
Attorney Lee Jun…

992
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,786
-No, Kim Jun…
-Choi Jun.

993
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,413
-Choi Jun. A single-syllable name.
-Yes.

994
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:06,462
I don't want to get involved
with Keumhwa in any way.

995
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:11,968
We're already tied closely together
by some terrible misfortune.

996
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,261
So I'm sorry,

997
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,974
-but please leave.
-I can't go back.

998
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,017
-Why not?
-I turned in my resignation.

999
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,688
I have nothing to do with Keumhwa now,

1000
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,608
and I ran straight over
because you're just my type.

1001
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,360
Attorney Choi.

1002
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:31,320
-Let me give you a piece of advice.
-Okay.

1003
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:36,117
Run back quickly
before your resignation is processed.

1004
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,662
But I want to work here.

1005
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,959
How about this?

1006
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,336
If you hire me…

1007
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,965
I'll take this down.

1008
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,050
What?

1009
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,102
I'm the owner of this channel.

1010
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:13,154
-June Man?
-June Man.

1011
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,363
-Like Jun.
-June.

1012
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:19,994
So it was you?

1013
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:21,871
Yes. You're so awesome.

1014
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,875
-Did you film it too?
-I even edited it myself.

1015
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:29,670
I see.

1016
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:34,383
You son of a bitch!

1017
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:51,275
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

1018
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,179
I planted someone in that office.

1019
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,639
Delete it.

1020
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,474
You'll hire me, right?

1021
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,393
Ms. Lee, you can be
the intake coordinator.

1022
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,062
He's going to die.

1023
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,730
Things often get crazier than expected.

1024
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,524
I was one of them, so I'll be fine.

1025
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,400
That's a great attitude.

1026
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,487
If Ms. Ma returns…

1027
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,573
About Gi-yeong.

1028
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,661
If I asked him to come with me to Hawaii…

1029
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:44,787
Lady.

1030
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,872
What do you think you're doing?

1031
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:51,961
